The first time you watch the lectures it will seem like they are being taught in another language, unless you are one of the top students in the class. This is a class where students with strong math and theoretical computation backgrounds will shine. Most however, will have a very tough time, including myself. But fear not, the curve is very generous if you have the fortitude to stick it out. My advice for future students is to watch the lectures, but do not rely on them alone. You should get both BOOK s, do further research on the internet, do the supplimental exercises, participate in Piazza, go to office hours, join a study group, etc. But most importantly, just stick it out. It will be tough, but worth it. I feel like I learned a lot. Some of it was interesting, but some was just complicated. My hope is that they spruce up the lectures for future classes. Again, they were very hard to understand for the average student. ",

The first half of the course is extremely theory-heavy and you need a strong understanding of set theory to do well. The curve is pretty generous. I ended up with a raw 85 on the midterm and that curved to a 100, so don't be discouraged if you aren't getting everything exactly correct. The main challenge is the logic-puzzle nature of the homework. Sometimes an answer will click pretty quickly and sometimes you'll stare at it for days and make no progress.

As others have noted, the class does have 2 distinct parts. The first part is theoretical, and the second part dives into some pretty heavy topics with algorithm analysis. I actually found the first half of the class easier to understand just because of the shear volume of information in the second part. As far as time commitment, you have 8 assignments due roughly every 2 weeks, and each assignment took me ~10 hours or so. Add in time for going through the lectures and studying/preparing for the tests. Grading is very fair. I really like Charles as an instructor and a TA, and he is very involved and approachable.

Office hours mostly are review of the videos, and many of Charlies videos are very compressed 'fly overs'. But expecting TAs to 'spell it out' would be too much. So, office hours are not very helpful. \nProf and some TAs are 'sensitive' to the discourse among the students. So, when people expressed too many conserns with the course, professor responded with the warnings about plagiarizm in homeworks and actually lowered the grades of several students. That worked, and no one complained much sinse. \nPiazza messaging was very active, but mostly from those who were 'lost'. Those who could be helpful did not really try to help because they were afraid to break 'code of conduct' by giving too much help, and also because of the curve (if others fail, your grade goes up). Even though the material is very interesting and very useful, I would not recommend taking this class the way it is this semester, but most of us have no choice because it is part of the requirement.

Also, even you understand 100% what is said in the video, unless you study the past exams, you'll not know what you need to remember in order to do well in the exam. For me, I never read the assigned paper (typical academic paper that don't get to the point, 10% of them are well written, the others are painfully boring to read), I just prepare flash card from past exam paper, spent one solid week+ to recall all the answer before the mid term and final and got A in both tests.

The projects were fairly basic and were not challenging from a programming point of view (I had relatively minimal experience with Python before the course, but pick up scripting languages pretty easily).

There is no professor involved with the course at this point, so it is entirely run by a group of TAs who do their best to make everything work but don't have the resources, time, or authority to fix the aspects of the course that are broken. The course consists of lectures, which in general are interesting and easy to follow, short Python networking assignments, and quizzes. If all of these were integrated into the Udacity system as they were originally when the course was created, everything would be much easier to deal with. Instead, the current TAs are locked out of the Udacity backend and have to create their own autograding system and quiz questions from scratch. Autograding has been a mess, with students receiving zero scores for seemingly correct work with no explanation, such as programming assigningments where the code is completely correct or quiz submissions where there is an extra newline at the end of the file. The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it's a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material. All these issues mean that there is a large backlog of questions from students on Piazza, and the TAs have a hard time keeping up. To succeed in this course procrastination is basically mandatory, because critical clarifications and changes to the quizzes and assignments will often only be posted a few days before the deadline. Aside all of these issues, the material in the course itself is very approachable and the workload is very reasonable in terms of time. I wish the higher level staff would do something to address the problems faced by both students and TAs in this course, because otherwise I would recommend this course a good way to get started in the OMSCS program without getting overwhelmed by courses that involve more advanced skills and a larger time committment.

A lot of the questions are so incredibly vague or the answers just didn't make any sense - in some cases, there were no correct answers available, which was acknowledged by the TAs on the course forum. My general process for handling the quizzes was to watch the lectures, read any supplemental papers that were linked, read the Piazza forum, watch the office hours... and when all that failed, as it frequently did, Google for the answers. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 10-question multiple choice quiz can take upwards of 6 or 7 hours to complete. The Piazza forum itself is another issue... it's very frequently difficult to get any sort of 'official' response from a TA to questions. Students are helping each other as much as possible, but it would be nice to get official confirmation for questions that relate to policy/procedures.

One assignment we were required to name a file 'quiz4', another assignemnt we have to name a file 'quiz-7' with a '-' character. Students obsessed over these details since the autograder scripts apparently cannot accept filenames with even the slightest variation (no wildcard characters??). All of the problems from this semester stem from a lack of leadership. There was no leadership from the TAs; not something entirely expected but it really hurt the course. The faculty of Georgia Tech provided no communication about this course's professor or his absence. There was no attempt to repair the course that clearly got off to a rough start.

Also on the negative side, the quizes were poorly written, not particularly challenging and often contained errors.

Also, while the quizzes *were* poorly worded and vague (which is unacceptable for any CS class), some students were quite rude to the TAs, who were trying to handle 500 students. I'd echo the sentiments above about the autograder too. GT should provide some automated grading framework like web-cat to handle that load instead of TAs writing custom, fragile auto graders. This way students could validate their code before submitting. I found the lectures very informative, the quizzes at their best made you go learn new things and at their worst confused the heck out of you with vague and imprecise language. I came into the class with zero networking knowledge or Python knowledge and I came out with an A. Don't take it expecting to learn Python. The most complex code you'll write is a loop. I do feel like the lectures were very beneficial though and enjoyed watching them. If they offer this class in the same format again (which I doubt they will), be sure to check Piazza often as there are some pretty funny exchanges between rude students who take themselves a bit too seriously and TAs that are stretched a bit too thin.

The quiz are not difficult at all, Most of the admitted students are smart and will be able to comprehend the material in the video lecture easily. So imagine how they can design the multiple choice questions to test your IQ? They make them very ambiguous so you might just choose the wrong answer even you understand everything they taught just fine. in Fall 2014 80% of the student got an A. No mid term no finals, just 10 easy programming assignments + multiple choice questions. Just brush up on your python programming (you need to be able to read code from framework, you only need to write a few lines for each assignment). A great deal of the frustration you'll get is to understand the python mininet API framework, which is the center piece of every assignment but none of the lecture video cover the framework at all. Use a good editor like pycharm so you can jump to definition of the framework python code. That's all you need. ",

TA's revise grades heavily and I'm confident the overall course will be graded on a curve but if you experience grade anxiety, this course may give you heartburn. ",

So it is fairly easy to keep up. \n\nNot to be confused with High-Performance Computer Architecture.. this class is all about Parallel Algorithms and how to program Super-Computers. You learn the Work/Span model and how to evaluate algorithms for Parallel Computers. You develop Parallel programs and you learn how to use new primitives to solve problems in a parallel manner. You learn how to program with both the Shared Memory and Distributed Memory architectures. There also seems to be a part about Cache Oblivious algorithms at the end (though we haven't gotten to that yet). \n\nOn the negative side though, there are topics that should be covered in lectures but aren't so you'll have to learn them on your own from arcane papers. The course organization could be improved a bit so that we aren't jumping from topic to topic. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with the subject matter then it will take some iterations to understand it. I went through the lectures 3x. \n\nThe labs require a LOT of time. Best start them early. The code is in C and C++ with OpenMP and OpenMPI. The main issue is just getting the code to work in the first place so you can then plan with the parallel part. \n\nThe TAs seem inexperienced and are mostly absent unfortunately. The professor is very engaged and answers a lot of questions on Piazza. The lectures are fun and funny to watch. \n\nIts highly doubtful I'll get an A in this class and a B will only be possible if I improve (I've gotten an A in every other class I've taken in the program).

There is a lot of studying of outside sources, not just the recommended readings, but whatever you can find on the algorithms you need to implement. They're not at all easy and you get very little credit for implementing them correctly. You'll spend a great deal of time just getting correct code, but you're graded mostly on performance, so keep that in mind. You need to pass the Udacity grader early, so you have plenty of time left to optimize and test your performance on the cluster. \n\nYou absolutely need to already know C, C++, and ideally at least a little about how OpenMP and OpenMPI work, or it's just going to get worse trying to learn that as you go. Know how to use common debugging and program analysis tools as well, gdb, valgrind, etc. You'll spend most of your time debugging early on when you're just trying to make sure the code works. \n\nFinally, know that it's not at all impossible to do well. I had trouble and had to drop because I was taking two other classes at the same time (including ML, which has very in-depth assignments) and was going through personal difficulties and just didn't have the time for it. If I had the time, I'm sure I'd have done fine. Just don't take the class lightly. You need to get an early start on every lab, do all the readings plus whatever other readings you can find, and get your code working early. I wish I'd known ahead of time we'd get almost nothing for correctness and be graded mostly on performance, which I guess makes sense in retrospect, but just wasn't what I was expecting based on all the other courses I've taken.

The most difficult aspect is that there is little guidance as to whether or not the metrics that you find in your projects are the optimal solution. This simulates the real world, where you have to make sure that what you code isn't outputting crap numbers, but makes it difficult to ensure that you get a good grade on every assignment, especially those where you are competing against the other students.

Projects take a lot of time, but most of it is from running the simulator multiple times under different conditions. This also means you need an early start on projects because making the wrong code change could take a few hours to figure out your results don't make sense. Exams I believe cover most of the material in the lectures, so there shouldn't be any surprises. Lots of quizzes throughout the lectures to reineforce the material. Overall I'm glad I took it, even if I won't be designing processors I think the techniques used to solve challenges in modern processors are useful for developing new technologies. ",

I forgot to submit that one (partly because the way the assignments are written makes it tricky to pull out what's needed for a submission) and got docked 30% of the whole grade. The course makes use of the SESC simulator, which is one of the worst, most poorly documented codebases I've ever seen. In addition, the effort required to work with SESC and modify it was vastly out of proportion to what we were studying. I never understood how wading through SESC to figure out how to change the branch predictor had any relevance to what a real processor does. Finally, the exams were a disaster. They used ProctorTrack for the test, but it was basically open book in that you could use any printed or written references, but couldn't use anything on your computer. You had to do everything by hand on paper (like when doing the incredibly tedious cycle counting problems). This was a real problem in the test, because I hadn't done them that way... I always worked in OneNote to set up my tables, plug in my steps, etc. When I had to do it on paper on my desk, it was a complete mess. ",

I've been doing professional development for over 20 years and honestly didn't really expect to learn much.... however I did (and a few things I had forgotten from the past got reinforced). I thought the professor's lectures were extremely professional and actually entertaining. Online resources including Piazza, Google Hangouts, and regular office hours from the professor and TAs also helped. I've taken four other graduate courses online at another school and this blew those away in terms of quality of content, interaction with other students and staff, and sophistication of projects requested of us. As an aside, I want to note here that anyone taking this course should invest in learning Java fairly well before diving in. It's a poor excuse to be taking an MS CS course but claim you're unable to do the project work because you're not a programmer. This is CS - it requires coding skills and this course definitely utilizes those skills. Just be glad it's Java and not Lisp or Erlang.... ",

The material explored many topics but none of them in-depth, in some cases were just basic tutorials for tools like git and Eclipse. The assignments felt more like jumping through hoops rather than being challenged to think critically and be creative. Overall the course felt disorganized and vague, most of the time I was not confident that I actually understood what was required and had to read a lot of forum posts for clarification, even on extremely simple busy work assignments. The most effort in the course is required during the group projects, which can include students anywhere on a spectrum from not being able to write code at all to having 10+ years of Java experience. A lot of groups had problems and partially due to that the last group project was changed to a solo project at the last minute. I think I would only recommend this course to beginners who are confident that they can write Java code but do not have much software development experience beyond that. If you know absolutely nothing about concepts like source control, test coverage, and UML then you will learn a lot. If you already have a lot of experience in software development and want to explore software engineering concepts higher than a very basic level, this course is not for you. ",

I came in to this class with 6 or 7 years of. NET development experience, but no Java/Android experience. I had to spend a little extra time on the assignments to transition my. NET knowledge over to Java, but it was easy to do so and the assignments are relatively basic. I would think that someone with zero programming experience would want to take a quick intro before jumping in, though. There were two group projects in this iteration of the class, which I'm normally not a fan of but they complemented this class nicely. Good simulation of working as part of a team in the real world. I felt like the way they handled grading the team vs. individual contributions was fair. I had a great group that had no problems working together, so I'm not sure how any serious conflicts within the team would be handled if the professor/TAs had to be involved. ",

GATech make an effort to place at least one experienced Java dev in each group so even if you are not particularly strong in programming, you can fill another role in the group such as testing and/or documentation. There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects. The overall progression of the assignments simulated a typical system development lifecycle project (with a RAD twist) with all the associated deliverables; systems requirements doc, prototype, test case doc, UML model, user manual, etc. I found that it was possible to deliver the assignments without really watching the lectures however part of your grade is based on your completion of the udacity quizzes so I guess this encourages you to watch all the lectures.

I understand it's trying to represent 'real-world' work where you have to collaborate with a team, but in the real world you don't have people with so little programming experience who are still gainfully employed, and quite frankly the 'project-manager' role for the project doesn't have an equitable share of the work.

' The only positive aspect of this is that it counts for class participation. I found many of the problems I reported just by copying the instructions and doing a spell check in Word. I know of 2 students who dropped other courses and one who withdrew from school because of this class. If you take it, be ready for a roller coaster ride. I never realized how much stress and anxiety can produce physical symptoms until I went to the doctor and she said I was likely experiencing a rapid heart beat and night sweats because of this class. The best thing about the whole experience is that now I have a profound respect for those people who deal with panic attacks on a daily basis. Worst class I've ever taken.

            "text": "My only complaint about the projects is that there was a significant amount of Physics domain knowledge required. Thankfully, on each team I was on there was always a physics guy, which was invaluable. The assignments can easily be done on your own, but I believe the group requirement for the assignments was to make things easier on the markers. Coordinating a group on the assignments was trivial; however coordinating the group for the projects was decidedly more difficult. I had two great teams, and one bad team, but I wouldn't use that as a reason to get rid of the group work. I found the group work a great way to meet other people in the OMSCS program. The course web site states that you need to know how to program, and that there will be group work. A few small tweaks, and this course will be awesome. This course is a lot of work, but I wouldn't steer clear of it. ",

            "text": "The projects in the course need to be restructured a bit. Too much emphasis on figuring out Physics-related requirements takes focus away from the project purpose of learning about Software Arch and Design. About 10% of project work was directly related to what we learnt in course. Rest of completely irrelevant. I thought the assignments were good. They reinforced things learnt in lectures. But they team based and that should not be the case. They are small enough for individual work. Plus the learing would be better if the entire assignment was done by a single person. Currently, sections of assignments are split up and you rarely get a full view of the topic at hand. Projects should be cut down in scope and grading emphasis should shift a bit more towards assignments. \nSince I had teammates who were in my timezone or in the zones at max 3 hours away, coordination wasnt really an issue. I am glad projects were team based since that is one way to meet other people in the course and learn from them. \nThe course has some great content like design patterns, design pricipiles and architectural styles. However, first section focuses on UML/OCL and pretty much everyone who had sw dev experience said that it is not very practical. We spent a lot of time on that in the course and during projects and it feels like a waste of time. Instead, if the lectures focuesd more on the other three topics I mentioned and go in depth about them, it will be useful. Some of the lectures on these topic were just 'read-a-list-from-telepromptor' type and that was really disappinting. \nWith some modifications, this can be a great course. ",

The lectures have a fair number of interviews with industry leaders, which is nice to see. I scored nearly perfectly, but the Mid term grading upset a lot of people (1/4 of the questions were thrown out for being poorly written). It was probably one of the worst designed tests I've taken in terms of judging a student's grasp of the material. It's also hard to predict how well you will do, given that 50% of your grade is unknown until the final week of the course (a semester-long group project with VERY loose specifications). If you are interested in HIT and maybe a bit of an exploratory fun project, it's not bad.

There was also no real motivation to read all the suggested extra material. We were never tested on any of it. \n\n2) TEXT BOOK : I purchased the 'text BOOK ', which the professor DOES say is optional. It was VERY overpriced ($79. 95, even though the professor mistakenly says that students will be able to get the discounted price of $64. 95, which is STILL overpriced). For the price, it’s closer to the size of a PAMPHLET than a text BOOK !! I was very shocked when it came in the mail!\n\nDespite being overpriced, the lectures ARE based on the book content, so the book does indeed provide a solid foundation to the videos. It helped me a LITTLE with the midterm, but after the unfair/ambiguous/subjective questions on the midterm I probably would have done fine without the BOOK. \n\nDespite these kinks, I will say that Prof. Mark and TA Shan are very knowledgeable and responsive to concerns.

In this semester, there were no exams and in their place were a set of timed quizzes. The quizzes are open notes/lectures and follow the lecture content very closely, so for the most part the questions can be answered if the student watches and understands the lecture material. Most of the more challenging work in the course has to do with the semester-long group project, which involves creating a web application that uses heatlh data records. The very start of the semester and project was somewhat disorganized, because many changes were made at the last minute to switch from the previous version of the group project to a new group project involving FHIR web services. Originally the course material stated that groups could use any web platform/framework/programming language, then after many groups formed around experience with particular technologies it was announced that all groups needed to use Java/Tomcat in order to deploy to particular machines at Georgia Tech that have access to the proprietary health data. The final deployment machines and data are not accessible to students during development, and at the end of the semester students will submit their completed WAR app which will be run on the machines with the full data for the first time without giving students the opportunity to fix any bugs or issues related to deployment and using the new data. Other than those issues (which my group avoided by requesting and being granted approval to use our own servers and data) the project is a straight-forward web application group project. Groups are required to use the health data in some way but aside from that the project is very open-ended in terms of what students can focus on for their app. As with any OMSCS group project, the previous experience of students varies greatly within the class, with some students having almost no web development experience on one end of the spectrum and some having worked in the industry for 10+ years on the other end. The groups are self-selected rather than assigned by the instructors so the overall experience level of the groups can vary as well. The instructors are active on Piazza with regular announcement posts and answers to questions from students, although sometimes basic details of assignments such as length or format of presentations are announced close to the deadline. For students with no web development or Java experience at all, I would suggest learning some basic skills before taking this course, and the CS 6300 course in the OMSCS program is the closest in terms of an intro to those sorts of development skills. Otherwise any student should be able to succeed in this course and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the topics. ",

No lectures really go all that in-depth on a particular subject though so it's more of a generalized view of informatics in the healthcare industry. There was a quiz every two weeks up until about 2/3 of the way through the course. At that point you're expected to work on the group project. The quizes questions for the most part were not very difficult if you paid attention to the lectures and used common sense; however, some of the questions were ambiguous at best and others downright confusing. \n\nWhat I found to be the most disappointing was the group project. Spring 2015 was the first semester they tried to use the GT FHIR server and it did not go well. Between the server constantly being under development, server connectivity problems, VPN problems, and a whole lot of other issues the project was a real pain for many groups. Our group decided fairly early on to abandon the GT FHIR server in favor of the more stable, public SPARK FHIR server and that turned out to be a good idea looking back on all the issues other groups were having. I felt our issues that we had to work through with our chosen server were relatively minor in comparison. \n\nGroup selection was an annoying issue with the course too. It look a couple weeks for everyone to find a group to join. The group I formed had a couple people express interest in joining only to find out they were apparently 'shopping' for the best group. The TAs sent out multiple requests trying to find groups for people to join as well. Also we didn't get to peer review our group members which was disappointing. The reason I say this class is Somewhat Easy is because the issues with the group project made it harder than it should have been. ",

The class could be run a bit better, but it is not all bad. I see lots of interaction on Piazza between the students and the TA's. Also, the professor does pop in the forum from time to time. I think the problems this class is experiencing stem from the fact that the prof is trying to keep the class up to date, so there is some churn in the material. Not a bad class at all. Assignments are spread out over the semester, so some weeks there is nothing to do (well, we are supposed to be working on our project). When there is an assigment, reading or otherwise takes a few hours in addition to the quizzes. This semester, we had one (1) try at taking each quiz. You do have to think/know the material to get it right. Oh, and be careful if you know healthcare already, because your definitions might not match those presented in the class and using your definitions on the quizzes will be counted wrong (this happened to several people).

The course is an exploration of education technology in whichever direction you wish to go in the space. There are a number of quicky videos and a growing library to help you decide if you don't come in already with some ideas. The course has a number of short essays due weekly that step you through the process of identifying an area of interest, reviewing existing research, and scoping a research project or development tool project for the remainder of the semester. The project is formalized with a Proposal that includes weekly milestones and some progress deliverables prior to the final completed project. Along the way, your progress is monitored by a single 'mentor' (TA) that is there to answer questions and ensure that your are on track, scoped correctly, etc. An important component of the class is participation, which includes giving and getting peer feedback along the way with each of the essays. The students are encouraged to participate in daily discussions on Piazza which follow a weekly pattern... 'What did you learn?', 'Q&A with ??', 'Let's discuss +/- of an existing OMS course', etc. The instructor is Dr. David Joyner, of KBAI fame, and he is extremely active on Piazza, keeping the class lively and engaged, which is no mean feat since we are all doing different projects. The final coursework is not done, so I can't comment here how it will all end, but so far it is a joy to be part of this particular environment. It is different from other courses.

There is ample room to go above and beyond on the projects if you have extra time, but you can usually squeak by on them without losing too much sleep.

The assignments are very interesting but can sometimes be challenging if you don't have both python and mathematical backgrounds. The one downside of the course is the lack of office hours and instructor/TA availablility. Often times I would ask questions on Piazza without them even being reviewed. I struggled with the python a little bit and wish I had some direction. The course is overall really good, though. ",

Comes in handy on the assignments so I can go right back to the exact section where he talked about something. Since they want you to use your own pics, it invests me with more interest in the assignments. I think the assignments have been very clear, and really not that hard conceptually. Paying attention to what is asked and answered on piazza helps. This is the first time I ever coded in python, that cost me hours of learning the syntax. OpenCV has reasonable documentation, but it might not all apply to your version. So fun at 2am. It's really opened my eyes to what is possible with computers. we are writing our own code, or using open source, and it has generally had impressive results. Class piazza tips and help has been invaluable, and people have seemed to hit the right balance between enough help to move on, but not give away too much. reading the suggested papers has provided the answers to how to progress more than once. This has been a great intro to the program, fun to be challenged again. ",

            "text": "So glad I took this class. The lectures are well done, but sometimes I felt myself in the dark because the math seemed way over my head. I have a minor exposure to linear algebra, and a strong exposure to calculus and I still found most of the math over my head. Some things that would be good to know ahead mathmatically: eigenvalues, gradients, sum of square differences, minor exposure to supervised and unsupervised machine learning, physic in motion and illumination, signal and frequencies, and of course the basic matrices and vector operations. The problem sets are the core of your grade and will vary in time commitment. I found ps1, ps4, ps5, ps6 to be the most time consuming having to work over 20 hours on each. The problem sets focused on creating the algorithms for the computation as well as modifying them to optimize your results, so it could get frustrating tweeking the inputs and variable of your algorithms. The professor of the lectures definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CV and a bit of his personality made the lectures very enganging. It's important to take notes for the lectures because at the end of the course there will be an exam and it is a pain have to go back through all the lectures as it was for me. The exam seemed fair. The instructor and TAs are helpful on piazza. And of course other students were very helpful. The office hours were helpful as well, I only had one problem with an office hour where I was the only student there and the TA was very unresponsive, but that was the exception to the rule. Take this course if you want to become interested in Computer Vision because you will once you take this course. The only thing I wish they had done for this course was post solutions to the problem sets after the deadlines. ",

You learn many different concepts of knowledge representation, problem solving, and machine learning. In the first project, you learn how to write a program to solve basic IQ test style questions. However, there are 4 projects in the class, and each project is just the same project, just with harder IQ questions. Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you're even somewhat busy, you're just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I've never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week. The amount of writing isn't much, but as someone who has gotten used to writing only for project reports, it really sucks. ",

Also, on the weeks that a midterm or a project isn't due, you have to write mini papers on how you would apply one of the many techniques to the project. Just be sure to keep up with lectures the best you can, stay involved in the class and don't procrastinate.

There are also assignments in the form of short papers explaining how you might apply a concept from the course to the projects, and take-home exams that similarly require exploring the concepts in-depth. Overall the instructors seem to really care about designing the course to give students the best learning experience possible and encourage creativity. You do not need to have any previous AI experience to take this course, and it's not very math-heavy compared to other AI courses I have taken. You will also have a much easier time on the projects if you are proficient in writing Python or Java code, a lot of the project involves coming up with and trying your own ideas for algorithms so being able to implement a new idea quickly is helpful. If you do end up having a hard time on the projects, the minimum performance for getting a decent grade is very reasonable.

If you start your programming assignments early, you should be able to do well in this course. \n\nTo counter the negative points made elsewhere on this page about having to write an essay every week, I would say that yes there is some writing involved but it's not really that much since they only ask for about 500 words per essay. The purpose of the essays is to give you a chance to think through how you will apply a specific AI technique to the programming assignments and dry-run your ideas in your mind before you start coding.

It seems that students with deeper algorithmic programming experience found the projects pretty easy, while others struggled monumentally.

I didn't have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn't necessary to get a decent grade. \nIn terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. \nYou will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it's fine if you think you've forgotten everything). \nIf one of those doesn't hold true for you, expect to put in a bit more time than my estimate.

Writing essays wasn't so much fun but after the first couple of assigments I realized that the quality matters more than the quantity.

            "text": "Yeaaa I'm gonna have a very different opinion here. I absolutely hated this class. I got an A, so it's not sour grapes, but it was an absolute waste of time. I'll list the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to. \n2. Easy A. Projects are not that hard if you're confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort. \n\nCons:\n1. Way too many things. I don't really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain. \n2. Grading is a joke. \n a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. \n b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment 'Good job', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment. \n3. Peer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn't even attempt. \n4. Content is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I'm amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don't mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it's machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class. \n5. Projects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project)",

I was enormously impressed by the responsive and productive communication between everyone, instructors and students alike.

The projects was where it was at as it was the most enjoyable (and most time consuming). You can write your programs in either Java or Python.

You get a choice between a visual (image processing) and a verbal (hashlike input processing) agent for the first two projects. If I could do it again, I'd do the projects visually from the get-go. Visual isn't much harder, is way more fun and less annoying, saves you from redoing things later and gives you more time to fine-tune your agent. Also, if it's all the same to you, between Java and Python, pick Python. Those guys seem to get way more useful library methods for image processing than the Java camp. ",

This course offered a lot of benefit, but I still don't think that it justified the work load. As mentioned above, research projects are very long reports, experiments take very long to run, and the assignments are the worst combination of loose-definition and high-expectation one could imagine. You choose your own tools, data, analysis, and pretty much everything, but it's still difficult to hit everything on the grading syllabus. Lecture videos are very entertaining and tied well into the assignments. Exams, I felt, did an excellent job of testing our 'synthesis of the material', as Prof. Isbell would put it. I hope the rest of my OMSCS courses are like this one, but with less busy work. ",

Your code is worth zero points; your analysis is all that matters. So do not spend time writing code, spend it writing the analysis. They are very secretive about the midterm and final. The test format is like any other college test, but they are hard - you probably cannot get the right answers by intuition during the test, even if you are very familiar with the topics; the answers tend to require reasoning abstractly under time pressure (although less time pressure on the final). Exam grading is very coarse - as though it's done by the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, earning zero points for the slightest provocation. Everyone should take this course. ",

The time-consuming aspect is usually learning how to do techniques needed for the assignment in Weka or another program, then actually running all of the experiments and collecting the data, before you can even start writing the 10+ page paper. If you try to procrastinate and wait until the last few days to start an assignment, you will not do well in this course. The exams are tough but fair, if you remember and understand everything from the lessons you should be able to answer everything without getting stuck, although the midterm was purpsosely designed to not give you enough time to complete it so don't waste too much time on any given question.

Needed to pull from old tests from other universities. \n\nUgly - Inconsistant grading of projects. Some received feedback of points off based on a rubric, some got only comments without telling where points where deducted and some got nothing at all. Felt some graders were tougher then others as I could tell several different grading styles. Either I had an easy grader for my third project or I got someone else's grade as it was my worst paper of the four but my highest grade. This will get worse as they may go to no feedback at all as the class size scales. You won't even know if your score is your own or a mistake.

I definitely recommend taking this class by itself, because the assignments can take an obnoxious amount of time to complete. Start the assignments early; it takes awhile just to figure out exactly what you need to get done on each assignment, and then even longer running experiments and collecting data. STAY ORGANIZED. I also recommend using the tools and libraries suggested (Weka, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, etc. ) for the assignments. The exams aren't aren't that difficult, but simply doing the problem sets isn't enough to do well. Prof. Isbell really emphasizes 'synthesis' of the material, which I translate to: 'a general knowledge of the concept, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it relates to other concepts'. ",

I certainly enjoyed the material. The lectures are a lot of fun and engaging, and surprisingly clear for the concepts presented. However, there was a big gap between the lectures/reading and the assignments, which to me felt like they really aimed to teach you how to do this type of work for yourself. Much of the learning required for the assignments was on your own. It would have been nice to have some kind more help (i. e. , domain knowledge) to get us going. Exams were mostly about 'synthesis', i. e. , demonstrating your knowledge/recall of the material through writing. reading all of the readings was very helpful for exams, but very time-consuming as well. As someone said, if you work full time, kiss all of your free time (and family time, and chore time, and etc. , time) goodbye!

This class was definitely the hardest that I've ever taken, and the most satisifying to complete. The lectures are top notch. I had to watch most video at least twice to understand them. They grade very slowly, and offer no feedback on test results. Grading on tests is tough. I used Java exclusively, but I think the more popular industrial tools are in Python or R.

I utilized many outside resources for this (there are excellent resources out there). So, overall, it didn't really feel like a course, more like a reference. Looking things up that you know are on a video is hard to do, though. Office hours were inconsistent, too, and it was really hard to get my questions answered (I used stackexchange often to look things up).

Its a fine strategy, and it does force the students to learn themselves with effort.

The parts that I enjoyed were where I had a flash of inspiration and was able to come up with applciations of the problems to solve things that I found cool, but without those flashes just meant that you are spending hours and hours thinking about random datasets that aren't really that exciting. The assignments are very open ended, and they basically just say 'Answer all of the questions that you can think of about [something]', but do note that there are specific requirements that you are graded against, you just don't get to see them in advance. This didn't impact me very much, but I know that others were annoyed that they lost points for something that wasn't specifically called out as a requirement. The TAs went through bursts of being responsive, but then we wouldnt hear much for weeks. Oh, and the peer review system that they set up was worthless. They said it was optional, but then mandated that you could only get answers from TAs about your grading through the peer review system (so much for optional), and the peer feedback came too late to help with anything.

It is a matter of choosing the best tool for the situation. With that in mind I think that it is essential to at least know a little bit of Java for assignment 2 using the ABAGAIL library, since MIMIC algorithm is not really implemented anywhere else. (MIMIC is based on an algorithm which is the subject of Charles' research). Be prepared for learning curve on the tools that you will use, because at least for me I ended up trying many different tools for my assignments, before settling on one. \n\nOverall, I have enjoyed the course and have learnt a lot.

I just finished the final and didn't find it to be as difficult as the midterm. I enjoyed both tests. And although the implementations of the algorithms were not required to be done for the course, the algorithms were given in class and left to the student to implement himself if he wanted to. I was not too fond of this at first, but realized that I learned more about the behavior of data and machine learning algorithms by seeing how they worked in a practical sense. If one wants to learn more indepth about how algorithms should be implemented look at the Coursera. com course on Machine Learning, which I also highly recommend. I am excited for the new reinforcement course taught by the same professors in the Fall. Its good to know Java and Python for this class.

The exams were also really fun and reflected both the high caliber of intellect and the wicked sense of humor found in the videos. \nI watched the lectures through once before taking the class - however, in retrospect, I would have been better off picking some good datasets for the assignments. Don't make my mistake and spend 20 hours during the course processing your music library into a dataset! Go into the course with 2-3 good datasets selected - datasets which are manageable enough that a neural net can do something meaningful with them. They link https://archive. ics. uci. edu/ml/datasets. html in the syllabus - you could also try http://mldata. org/ and https://bitly. com/bundles/bigmlcom/4. \nI used Weka, ABAGAIL, ABAGAIL and BURLAP respectively for the four assignments. Note that these required virtually no coding. They encourage you to do as little coding as possible for the assignments, and they are serious about this. Unfortunately, they had very specific grading criteria which they didn't share in advance of the assignment submission, particularly for the first one. It also took an insane amount of time to turn around the assignments - I got back assignment 1 on the day assignment 2 or 3 was due. Because of this it took me some time to even understand what they were looking for in the papers. \nOn the flip side, their final grades were quite forgiving, and if you had a good score on the final and the last assignment they erred on the side of giving you a higher mark. So don't let the grading scare you away. ",

For both material I had seen and not seen before, Prof. Isbell and Prof. Littman did a great job of presenting the ideas, intuition, and some degree of mathematical formalism. If only my classes in undergrad were so entertaining! Maybe there were a few things that I didn't know, such as algorithms and complexity, but nothing a little Googling couldn't solve. The lecture videos take maybe 4 hours a week, with some pausing. What really kills the brain is some of the REALLY long and mathematical reading. My advice: skim, but don't skip the reading. There's a lot of interesting details, not to mention having a broad view of the field of machine learning is quite useful if you want to practice data science. So you have to be efficient. (Read: Data science != Machine learning). \n\nThe tests were fair in my opinion. They did make me think hard about the properties of the methods we studied. But they are long. It's a bit annoying to use the text entry methods on T-Square, especially when Piazza was way better for typesetting math. \n\nProbably as many people will say, the homeworks were incredibly time consuming. On average, the homeworks took me about 40 hours. This includes brainstorming ideas, programming and implementation of algorithms, collecting data, generating graphs and tables, and writing the report. I admit that I'm a pretty slow (bad?) coder, but using Python made it easier. On the other hand, Python has fewer resources and is slower than Java. But that's the practical lesson of the homeworks: balancing speed of implemention, execution time, and effectiveness. Don't make your homework needlessly complicated though, since your goal should be to master the concepts, not programming!\n\nThe recommended book (by Tom Mitchell) was pretty accessible. It's not a criticism of the class, but I thought many of the examples IN THE book were lame or otherwise uninteresting. On the other hand, the chapter introductions and especially summaries were a great review. I would recommend also checking out a few other BOOK s in addition. \n\nLast comment: Piazza is awesome, especially if you are active. I didn't find Hipchat to be very useful since it was a bit too real-time and you couldn't typeset math when you needed to explain equations or what not. I didn't attend any of the office hours. ",

You need to choose what tool or software package to use (WEKA, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, R, SciKit, etc. ) as well as what algorithms and parameters to use in many cases. You are given very little direction on how to perform the expiriments, so they typically take a great deal of time to setup. You are given zero points for implementing the actual expiriment, the grade is based entirely on your analysis of your results.

The level is very good and assignments allow you to make the course as difficult as you want. Some suggestions: To students - 1) follow the assignment rubric carefully, if it says do kurtosis analysis - do it (it's actually not that optional as you might think). If you do a reasonable analysis following rubric fully, you can be almost sure you'll get more than 90% and all the rest will depend on the amount and quality of your analysis. 2) Do all optional work you are given (reviewing assignments, problem sets, etc. ) It will help understand the material and get a better grade. 3) If you want to really succeed on the exams (like solving almost all problems) and it is your 1st ML course, then doing lectures and homework assignments most probably won't be enough. Read the BOOK s and solve some additional problems from other sources. To Profs: 1) it would be great to make problem sets a little closer to the type of questions students will see on the exam (both questions and problems), I felt that they were slightly disconnected sometimes. 2) It would be better to provide more problems in each problem set (even if they are optional). 3) It would be good to see not only midterm exam explained by Profs, but also Final - it is a really important educational piece to know what you did right/wrong on the exam and why.

The difficulty of this course is it covers a ton of material. It mostly glosses over regression and doesn't address generalized linear models at all, nor does it go into any kind of graph analytics. There is exactly zero discussion of tools and applications. What you get is the kitchen sink of techniques for taking in data and gaining some understanding of it, as well as optimization and optimal control thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe treatment of the math is frankly fairly superficial if you have a decent working intuition of probability and linear algebra. There isn't much discussion of statistics and it would help to supplement what you get here with some outside reading about resampling, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and various loss functions. You need these to analyze the results you get. You don't need to get deep in the weeds with proofs, but understand how and why they work and what you're measuring. \n\nThe biggest thing is don't underestimate the assignments. Don't get cute trying to build web scrapers or pull real-time data from APIs, doing all kinds of feature engineering. Being a data ninja is fun, but this isn't the class for it. You'll get zero extra credit for that. Pick something from the UCI repository that is ready to throw into a train function right away. 100% of the points you get are your analysis. Use well-tested library code on simple datasets and put your effort into visualizing and explaining the performance characteristics of each algorithm, because you need to run quite a few of them. Know what a complexity curve is, a learning curve, a confusion matrix, know what the tuning parameters are for each modeling package and know how and why performance changes when you tweak them. And know the performance measures! Be prepared to explain why you would use accuracy, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, or whatever measure you use. It's specific to the problem you're trying to solve and this isn't covered in lectures or in the required text, so do some outside study. The package documentation for modeling software usually explains these things pretty well and it isn't complicated, but you'll lose points if you just use straight defaults across the board and can't justify why you chose the resampling technique, parameter tuning strategy, and performance measures you chose.

You gradually build up a Python module that includes all of your code from prior projects, ending up with a working market simulator that you can use to backtest trading strategies. That said, I feel the course suffers a bit from its Coursera background and desire to simultaneously be ML for finance students and finance for CS students. It's very, very easy, covering the very basics of portfolio management but only including long and short equity positions, nothing on derivatives, fixed income, FX. If you've used NumPy and pandas before, you can basically sleep through the first month of the course. I was hoping for more coverage of times series analysis and how to deal with non-IID samples, fat tails, heteroskedasticity, etc. , since we seem to just assume IID and approximately normal in developing ideas in the base ML course, but I guess this is a CS program, not a math or econ program. The other issue here is they're revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they're not releasing them on-time and we've ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on.

This course has less of a heavy workload than many of the other courses, especially early on before the Runaway Robot and Final Project parts. Part of that is due to how streamlined the assignments are, the coding is built into the Udacity interface so you just write code and submit it like a normal quiz answer. I much prefer this method over the methods used in some of the other courses where you have to setup your own environment locally and worry about packaging everything up for graders to be able to reproduce it on their side. I spent a very long time on the final optional Runaway Robot part and completing it felt like a big accomplishment even though it was autograded like every other coding assignment, so just because there is an autograder doesn't mean all of the assignments are easy. The Final Project is extremely open-ended and lets you explore whatever topics from the course interest you and apply it to any domain. I really enjoyed that flexibility because I could choose a topic and project that I found interesting and wanted to put a lot of time into. You will need to write Python code for all of the assignments but as long as you have some programming experience you should be okay, if you find yourself lost early on you can probably learn Python from other resources online as you are taking this course. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you are taking another course with a heavy workload and want an interesting course that you will learn a lot from that is more flexible on time.

On the other hand, more materials could have been taught and so it requires your own initiatives to go further. It's a little wasteful to treat this as a full semester's module. Given Sebastian's schedules, expect his involvements to be very minimal. It takes a very helpful and knowledgeble TA and an engaging piazza community to get the course going. Design of the final project wasn't very well considered, as you couldn't really apply the knowledge. One classmate proposed his own idea, which I thought was way cooler. go google github for py-fire or something, Would be super awesome if the community can take his project, develop further into future assignment for the course.

The lectures are structured to take full advantage of the Udactity integrated python enviroment. This makes it easy to make incremental advances in your understanding of the topics. I wish they covered a few more ways to apply the different types of filters. Each filter is explained in a particular context and without experience in the field it's difficult to see how it could be applied in another situation. Regarding, the projects, the first is pretty applicable and well designed. The second project seems to have little to do with the course material and you end up integrating something just for the sake of the project's requirements. ",

Professor Thrun is very entertaining and holds regular office hours to answer student questions in a Q&A format. You do not need the book at all for this course! I purchased it thinking I would reference it, but only cracked it open once or twice and would not buy it again. The only criticisms I would make are that the assignments make use of a custom Matrix() class, whereas students could probably get a little extra Python learning in if the assignments used numpy. Also, with the exception of the Runaway Robot Project #5, the class is almost a little too easy. I hate to use that word because the concepts are pretty advanced, but the assignments are more or less spoon fed to some degree. Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\n\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it. The final project is worth a whopping 40% of the class grade and is very open ended with minimal opportunity for extra credit (3 teams total). To me it seems that the final is worth a little too much and the weekly assignments are not worth quite as much as they should be. I ended up with a grade that I am very happy with, but it came a little too close for comfort ;) Perhaps I was too busy enjoying the class?",

I had very limited experience in C (just from college many years ago) and I mainly use higher level languages like Java, C#, JavaScript and Python at work so diving back into C was a little bit of a challenge. But its very doable, do not get scared just because its C and it has pointers and manual memory allocations. You will be fine. Start your projects early and use the Piazza forums. The students are super helpful and there are always active discussions talking about common bugs or sharing online resources. Use the provided VM! Do not try to write and run programs in your own setup! Its not worth it and will only lead to headache. When you start the projects, break them down into bite size chunks.

Based on voluntary polls I conducted on G+ students reported spending on average about 40 hours on project one and three, and about 5 hours on average on project 2 and 4. There are also many opportuniteis for extra credit. There are very easy ways to prepare for this course, download an ubuntu linux VM and start writing C that reads and writes from files, sends text and data overa TCP/IP socket, performs string manipulation, and parses command line arguments. These skills were necessary to complete the projects, but not the focus of the project. Despite how much work these projects require, you have plenty of time to start on them (you can start project one on day 1 and it is due 6 weeks in). NOTE: I spent on average 10-15 hours per week, but this is because I worked ahead on light weeks. If you strictly follow the syllabus you will not succeed. For example the first two weeks of the course only took about 2 hours a piece to complete, but I used that time to start project 1 early and it paid off. Start early, use the forums on Piazza, get used to linux and C, and fight the urge to be a perfectionist. It is easy to self induce work on these projects and overwhelm yourself. There is no need to turn in production quality code. ",

Infact I believe it was piazza discussions that really helped me with the projects. Knowing atleast a bit of C, functions and pointers in C and creating a robust linked list program prior to the course will be very useful. The linked list that I created for project 1, I reused it for project 3. The classes were very well organized and lots of effort and thought has been put into organizing this class.

Some specific C skills you'll need and are expected to have for Project 1 are the following:\n\n - string manipulation (i. e. , strcpy, strcat, strtok) and understanding/using null-terminated strings\n - use of pointers; nothing too complex like pointer arithmetic, but knowing how to initialize them, malloc space for them, derefence a pointer, and use the address of a variable as a pointer reference\n - general memory functions like malloc, free, memset -- this might be challenging if you've only used more abstract languages like Java and C#; took a while for me to wrap my head around it\n - file I/O: binary read/write, reading a file size (lseek) \n - using proper header files for prototyping (. h files) and (in later projects) incorporating provided. h files to implement APIs\n - creating a basic Makefile to build your application (though after Project 1 they started providing these)\n - creating a queue (linked list) structure and the functions needed to queue and dequeue items in an instance of that structure (again, after Project 1 they provided a library for this; not sure if future iterations of the class would go ahead and throw that in as a resource for the first project)\n\nYou're expected to be able to do the above with only the most basic and standard C libraries. We were allowed to ask if we could use a certain library to complete parts of our projects, but to my knowledge none of the small handful of requests were approved. But once C starts clicking and you get a handle on the basics, you don't really need any special libraries. \n\nThere's also a brief overview early on of how to create a basic web server and web client that communicate over a socket, which you'll have to implement and expand on (every project is a client/server combination). I found it to be a little too basic, but I was also struggling to get my C legs (get it?). I'd recommend that if you're a C noob, you also find a good introduction to connecting to, sending, and receiving over a socket. The first project requires that as part of its functionality, but while there's a lot more to it than that, I found it to be one of the most time-consuming portions. \n\nIf that seems overwhelming, I can say that I started the course with no previous C experience. I had primarily done C# and Java coding prior to taking this class, and I was able to get up to speed. If you have decent coding experience, you'll be fine. You'll just learn how much you take for granted. :) \n\nAs far as the material/exams go, I found that to be very easy to handle. The lectures aren't terribly long, they build on each other well, and (bonus!) they include a lot of fun graphics. I had no former exposure to most of the lesson topics, and I found the majority of the material very accessible. \n\nOh! A lot of people used valgrind and gdb for debugging, as well. ",

The instructor has only one solution in mind. But they don't provide you any guidelines. And then you have to spend endless hours trying to figure out what they had in mind. Obviously there are so many other ways to solve the problem. But you're constrained to figure out what to do with the terse and convoluted code skeleton provided without much explanation. And then there's the whole mess of the autograder which only works with the solution they had in mind. Other working solutions might fail the autograder with mysterious messages. The TA's would never acknowledge the problems with the autograder and would always blame it back on the student. The only help they provide is very genericand doesn't help much. At the end of all of it, you're not given any solution guidelines. So you don't really learn what you did wrong and how you could improve. I have professional experience using C for a couple years. C is not the problem. I have a job that requires no more than 40 hours a week. But at the job I have to be intense and sharp. This course has definitely affected my job.

I think the real challenge is coming up with a suitable design to fulfill project objectives. I acknowledge that the autograder can be frustrating at times but it did make me think critically about what I was intending my code to do and what it was actually doing. When I reconciled my design and objectives the autograder would be happy. Secondly, I spent too much time on design and underestimated the amount of testing that was required. The projects are a little thin on specification so it is more or less up to you to devise suitable test cases that match what you think the project objectives are. The marks that I lost in assignments were in hindsight I think due to not thinking more about testing. The problem here is that you will clock a lot of hours.

I would highly recommend starting the projects as soon as they are available to make sure you have enough time to finish them (and try to get it through the autograder). The code skeletons and Udacity autograder are new this semester, as I understand it. I personally enjoyed the projects the most from this class, and while the autograder can be frustrating at times (when the feedback is too vague, or you don't really get any at all), I was always able to find the issue by doing more testing of corner cases myself, which would uncover a crash or deadlock in certain circumstances. The benefit is that you once you've passed the autograder you can be confident that you've done things correctly. I also like the new phased approach to the first project, where you have a few 'build-up' assignments that you should complete before the main project. I personally didn't find the code skeletons a problem or too restrictive, although understanding how it all fits together can be overwhelming at first. By looking at what is given in the skeleton and how certain functions are defined you should be able to figure out how to make everything fit together.

I would only recommend taking this class if you took the Machine Learning class and thoroughly enjoyed the last few lectures on reinforcement learning. Edit: Just had the 8th homework assignment. Literally sat in a chair all weekend working on it for 20+ hours, to only get close to the right answer. Be wary of what you're getting yourself into.

The typical first-run course snafus with project definitions and scheduling were compounded by some medical problems that the instructor had during the semester, so our experience might not be all that representative going forward. That said, almost 2/3 of the semester were spent on just getting some basic concepts down for python and finance, and we didn't even approach any ML until almost November. The projects themselves were fine. Because of the problems that I mentioned, we had a short runway to complete some of the projects (we didn't get the description of one of the projects until after the planned due date had already passed), and they had to shuffle the syllabus around a bit to accommodate (including dropping the final exam). I assume that wont be a problem in future semesters. They went away from an autograded project to a written report on the later projects, and finishing the report proved to be time consuming for me. But they are flexible and provide 5 late days for projects that you can use however you want during the semester. \n\nGreat instructor and staff, and a fun course. You will enjoy it!",

Still, I would be able to appreciate the time and effort the videos and organization of material must have taken, but there is nothing to back this learning up. The assignments and quizzes are a joke - just testing rote memory from the lectures - and the phrasing is terrible. There is very little guidance provided for the open ended group project, and instructors and TAs are slow to respond, if at all. I enjoyed my group and learned from the process because we took initiative to push ourselves. It's an easy 3 credits, but I'd rather have spent my money on a better run class and read up on these topics on my own. ",

I paired this course with Computability, Complexity, and Algorithms, and that worked out okay. \n\nEven though this course was not extremely hard, I actually feel like it is one of the better and more beneficial courses in the program. It is both highly practical and very enjoyable. And I think that is true even if you never write another piece of code having to do with trading after the class is over. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind. While the workload is lower during the beginning of the semester, the projects towards the end of the semester are significantly more time-consuming. So keep that in mind when considering your schedule. ",

I took it in the Summer Semester and it was definitely 'jam packed', requiring my full-time attention. I would recommend the class during either the normal Fall or Winter schedules, but not during the reduced timeframe Summer schedule. My '30 hours per week' would probably be less had the course been spread over the normal amount of time. \n\nI would seriously recommend either taking the CP or CV class before taking this class or have a decent amount of experience using Python's PIL image module. Without this background, you'll be at a disadvantage with the projects. I spent a lot of time learning image processing and went down a lot of dead-ends on my projects because I wasn't prepared for the visual processing aspect of the projects. IMHO, taking CP or CV should be a prerequisite of the class, or at least strongly encouraged. \n\nDavid Joyner is an excellent and enthusiastic teacher, unlike some in this program who seem totally 'checked-out'.

            "text": "I had previously taken the class when it was offered on Udacity as a MOOC before it became a \"for-credit\" class at GT. It's exactly the same. I had been hoping that it was 'beefed up' a bit for a graduate program but it's not. \n\nThe best part of this class is that Sebastian is a great teacher and enthusiastic about his work. While he doesn't participate much in the forums, he does conduct live office hours (or at least he did the semester I was taking it. ) This is where you can 'go deeper' on the material and learn from the master. This is really the best reason to take the class if you're interested in robotics. Sebastian is a 'god-amongst-men' in the world of robotics and you're unlikely to ever get so much valuable face time with somebody of his caliber as easily. \n\nThe projects are pretty easy. (KBAI and Computer Vision have way harder problems sets) The TAs were responsive and held regular office hours using Google Chat which allowed students to view them after the fact. (This skill set seems to allude TAs in other classes, so kudos to the AI for Robotic TAs for figuring this out. )\n\nThere is an allowance to let the students either propose their own projects or work on the 'assigned' final project. Due to an illness, I had to work on the assigned final project, which is what most of the class did anyway. Frankly this assigned final project is pretty much a waste of time and a 'fool's errand. ' While you apply what you've learned, very little of it makes much difference to the end results. Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the 'high side' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class. \n\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project. This will allow you to pick a problem that is directly related to robotics rather than the contrived one that seemed pretty pointless. If I had it to do over again, this is where I'd make my change.

The projects have definitely been beneficial, but the organization/timeliness of the course team and how/when these projects were presented and what they actually covered was a bit disappointing. Yes, it was the first semester this was offered, so I expected it to be imperfect and feel the students have had grace for that. Going into the semester, I was thinking that between the two brand new courses I was taking, this would be the more organized b/c the instructor had taught this multiple semesters, already had a class website, and had an environment already setup. Another of the disappointments I have had are that many of the final projects have been filled with coding the underlying ML algorithms from scratch rather than actually applying ML to the quantitative finance domain. It seemed that ML knowledge was prerequisite for the course, so I therefore thought that's what the course was about. I'd expect some of this implementation of the basic workhorse algorithms in ML to be in an ML class... kind of like our implementation requirements of 7641. With that mindset, it seemed rather frustrating to receive project assignments approx. 1 week prior to the due date that were requiring this type of development... and again, not necessarily tied-to the trading / computational finance domain. I wish we could have spent the time working on some of the things that the extra credit proposed instead of working on developing my own KNN learner, bag (bootstrap aggregator) learner, Qlearner, or Dyna. \n\n... All that said, it really was a great class and I learned a lot. I actually began really liking Python through this course... it's mandatory, so be ready. Those taking the class do come away with a decent set of software that could be further developed to make a nice personal trading system.... or, if motivated enough, I suppose you could even start your own hedge fund.

            "text": "This is your warning: steer clear of this class. If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar. \n\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn't inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well. \n\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course. \n\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are \"select all of the correct responses\" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy \"1 quick quiz per week or two\" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option. \n\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren't able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines. \n\nI'll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was \"take this if you want an A\" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments. \n\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn. \n\nKeep in mind that I'm currently scoring in the 85%+ range. I put in a lot of time for this class. I wish I could have invested that time elsewhere. ",

I enjoyed the content very much, which was an advanced rehearsal of the software architecture classes I received in college, and the programming portion wasn't difficult at all. \n\nThere was a lot of documentation to write. You need to be ready for it and feel comfortable creating UML diagrams and writing lots and lots of content. This is tricky because your evaluation will highly depend on what somebody else interprets of your writing. In Software there are usually multiple ways to skin a cat, so you need to make sure to show the instructors that your way is a valid one. \n\nThe course uses Java throughout. If you have used it before, you shouldn't have any problems getting by. The material is not complicated, and I enjoyed the different programming assignments. The final project is the development of an Android application, which will take some time. I did Android before, so I felt right at home, but I saw some people struggling because the learning curve wasn't easy. \n\nDuring the class, you are part of a team that works the projects together. Teams are somehow hit or miss; there's usually somebody that does very little to help during the class. If you are unlucky, you can find yourself bearing most (if not all) of the work. At the end of the project, you get to evaluate each team member, which is appropriate and forces people to try to be helpful. \n\nIn the end, it was an excellent course, and I loved the material. Although I was very familiar with the topic, I had the opportunity to rediscover things that I had long forgotten. The workload stretched me enough, and I highly recommend it for anyone working in the Software industry.",

There is hardly anytime to write a great AI agent because you spend so much time writing.

I'm sure there are students that will argue my experience, but I want to actually program to see what they are talking about actually works in the real world. I felt the lectures were too high level and the examples were at the grade school level. So it was really difficult to find value in the lectures. This is not a critique against the professor and the TA's they are great! It just that the material could have been presented better.

A normal week I probably spent about 10 hours, but weeks in which projects were due it was more around 20-25 hours. The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice. I did learn a lot about the subject and thought it was well presented. That being said, I do have two major gripes about this course:\n\n1. Feedback and Grades. I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn't have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know. \n\n2. Group projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience. I honestly would have been better off doing it all myself. Keep this in mind if you take this course!\n\nOverall I give this course a 4/5. I enjoyed the material and learned a lot about software architecture and design. While time consuming, I enjoyed the class. Just learn from my naivety and be careful when selecting a group",

Be prepared to spend a most of your time working on problem sets and tweaking parameters to get the perfect result. Also, be prepared to have your mind warped by some of the math involved. If you are familiar with Python and Numpy, you will be in a good position when you start this class. I myself was not a Python / Numpy expert, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me there too. \n\nLike others have mentioned, this class was recently taken over by a new professor who did not participate on Piazza a lot. You will have to lean on your fellow classmates and TAs if you get stuck. Other than that, this class is awesome. I highly recommend it. It might be painful at times but, if you push through, you will be glad you did. I learned a ton in this class. ",

There has clearly been an attempt to make the class harder even though I believe some leniency was given near the end of the semester making the grades much higher. This is my first class and below is my review:\nPros:\nClass projects were interesting and fun\nThe professor holds regular office hours and is responsive during those times\nEducational and I learned alot, granted I didn't know anything about networks going in. \nCons:\nTest questions lead to ambiguity and make it harder. Even when valid arguments were given for bad questions no credit was normally given. Meaning people never really well explained how they were wrong. \nLast project didn't work well and instead of fixing just made it optional as a way to replace. Project was really interesting and wish it had been fixed. \nTAs were fairly helpful in Piazza but the Professor was very slow at responding to things needing his attention. Overall many times got more clarification from classmates than from the TA or professor on Piazza. I feel lucky we had some talkative classmates. \nAlot of need to research outside sources to get answers to test questions. Not testing my understanding but my ability to clarify the statements. \nVideos didn't spend enough time explaining complex concepts forcing extra research as well. ",

IOS was a good basis when you're not already familiar with C and systems programming. \nEvery lecture walks students through a single paper, explaining the concepts and adding historical, academical context. The selection of papers is very good, it's a journey through landmark ideas in systems research. Reading all the papers was impossible for me with a day job and hobbies. I resorted to reading the abstract and summaries (provided by peres as part of course requirements) for about three quarters of the material. \nThe grading of projects and exams seems fair and forgiving. \nThe projects are tough and require recognizing challenges and coming up with your own designs for them. Also you have to write your own test code, which can be a substantial part of the project. It is always recommended to start working on the project 2-3 weeks in advance to be able to ask questions on Piazza and also just to sleep over it and find solutions to problems. They are definitely not \"just doing the exercise\". \nThe course requires a bit of investment, but offers tremendous learning opportunity. I was also constantly drifting off into the subjects covered while browsing through Wikipedia, research papers and technical manuals. ",

These notes are copy & pasted from the Piazza forum of the course. \n\nI did not like this course very much. Disliked the flow of the lectures, had a hard time following what Dr. Goel tried to explain and could not relate lecture content to the projects really. Has been the most frustrating class so far in my curriculum. I really liked the organization and effort that went into the interactive exercises, the overall communication, grading and the friendly frequent contact. David's been a great instructor. \n\nThe whole educational strategy of this course is brilliant. I would love seeing it applied to other courses. \n\nI can appreciate how the KBAI class falls into the \"academic-style thought\" bucket. I admit, I might have approached the class from a wrong angle, even though it said so right on the labelling. \n\nBut then I doubt the validity of your airplane analogy. Of course the airplane project would not touch upon every subject, but conversely the lectures should instruct how to actually design such a plane. Or at least point to the right resources, tutorials or books. I just thought it would not hurt to slide in a lecture or two that examines the design and implementation of a couple of cool and interesting classic or modern AI agents (maybe a simple one right in the first week to illustrate what we're talking about, a more complex one in the middle and an advanced one at the end). I would argue it would strengthen the understanding of the high level concepts being thought. ",

The grades are all \"curved\" for lack of a better term to be normalized to a standard 10 point grade bracketing. \n\nYou will definitely want to prepare ahead of time for the course.

While they won't necessarily prepare you for the assignments, if you can't understand the notation used in the lectures, you should review it until you do. \n\nOne thing I will mention regarding some of the other reviews: there is a very specific academic integrity guideline when it comes to using outside resources (not the lectures or prescribed textbooks).

Just follow it to a T and you should have no problem using outside resources to help with the homework problems. ",

Of course each student is responsible for his/her own grade, but there's a problem if half the students are essentially failing the course. Expect a lot of outside study of the material. The lectures are barely useful. They gloss over the material and give no concrete examples that are on par with the homework. These are some of the shortest lectures of any OMSCS course I've taken (out of 6) and this is the hardest of any of the OMSCS courses by far. That's a problem. I also think the level of mastery expected by the professor is unreasonable in a single course. There should be a prerequisite for this course. The difficulty is just unreasonable for students that are new to the material. It sounds like earlier professors were more reasonable about this and graded accordingly. \n\nMy advice?

The course is made up of 4 projects, a midterm, final, and class participation on Piazza. The lectures are great and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you. I feel this has prepared me well for the workload/work ethic necessary to succeed in classes to come. You get out what you put in!\n\nAlso 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' is a free online book that I referenced A LOT to give me an intro into the topics discussed in the lectures. Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\n\nFull Details:\nThe projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects. You will want to start looking into the basics of socket communication, posix threading library, posix/sysv IPC mechanisms and synchronization. You will be provided enough material to get you going with each of the items listed in the last sentence. \n\nThe midterm and final are not easy and it is not enough to \"memorize\" formulas/concepts. You will need to understand the purpose and how each input to the problems/equations affect the output and then formulate what pieces are necessary to come to the correct answer. You will really have to understand the material. That said it is possible to do well. Participating in Piazza discussions, re-watching lectures, and doing the projects will prepare you well in understanding the concepts/problems on the exam. \n\nOne thing you might not expect is that you are provided an Ubuntu VM that is set up to test your projects in before trying the auto-grader in Udacity. Valgrind and GDB will be your best friend and help you find things that the auto-grader will detect and fail your submission even though things in the VM work fine. I would recommend some sort of version control too (I used git)!",

            "text": "This is a very difficult class. I spent at least 30 hours a week on homework, and I have a CS/Math background. Some things I'd recommend before beginning the class:\n\n* Get familiar with mathematical notation. I spent lots of time early on just trying to figure out how to read and understand the assignments, let alone work through solutions. \n* Familiarize yourself with basic proof methods (induction, direct, contradiction). Luckily I had an old discrete math book from undergrad lying around that was very helpful in the beginning weeks of the course. It's also worth skimming over general topics in discrete math (and probably some from graph theory as well). \n\nI can't emphasize enough how little free time I had during this class. I had time to go to work, come back home and study/do homework for 3-4 hours, and then go to bed. I also spent most weekends working on homework. 16 weeks of this is draining--I can't imagine doing this with a family and/or other obligations. However, the work I put in definitely paid off. I was able to get over 100% as my homework average, which balanced out a mediocre performance on the final. I ended up with an A (barely). \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures for this class were very hit and miss for me. I really enjoyed the first half of the class, and thought the lectures did a better job of thoroughly explaining the concepts. The second half of the class was less enjoyable for me. The lectures seemed to assume a very strong background in linear algebra and didn't work through examples at some crucial points (thinking specifically of the linear programming lectures). I took linear algebra in undergrad and so that part wasn't so bad, but the lack of examples on things like the Simplex method really made things difficult. Don't try to breeze through the lectures. When watching, I would rewind a portion 3 or 4 times with pencil and paper in front of me. If I didn't understand a concept, I'd rewatch until I could write it out in my own words. This helped in the long run, but was excruciatingly slow. There were several times, especially during the second half of the semester, that consulting Google for lecture notes from other programs was beneficial. If you do this, make sure you cite your source if you're working on homework. \n\nHomework:\nFor me, the homework in this class was the most valuable part of the class. Dr. Pryby's assignments were extremely difficult (hours and hours of work), but they forced you to understand the concepts in the lectures, and stretched you to think deeply about the topics. The feeling you get when you figure out that key piece of insight is amazing. This is where you should really focus your efforts. It is possible to get > 100 as your homework average if you work hard enough, and this can help pick up crucial slack for the midterm and final. The only real complaint I have about the homework is that sometimes the solutions were not presented very well. I'd prefer to see solutions in as dumbed-down terms as possible so that the class can easily follow how a particular solution was derived. Go to as many office hours as you can--occasionally I didn't think I needed any help on a homework, but joined anyway and the TA would basically give you the answer, or give you an insight that made you change your answer for the better. \n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this review, it's to start the homework early. Being able to grind away at a proof over the course of 2 or 3 days is just not something you can pack into an hours long window (unless you're a math whiz). Give yourself enough time to really think about the problems. Write an answer out, then come back to it a few days later and see if it makes sense. \n\nTests:\nThe tests were extremely stressful. Unless you're a genius, you probably aren't going to finish all of the problems. You have 3 hours to complete 8 to 10 problems, some of which are formal proofs. That gives you 18 to 22 minutes on each problem. One strategy I adopted was to go through the entire test and work on problems that I immediately had insight on. It's not worth spending 30 minutes on a problem you just don't get, and then missing a problem that you might have been able to quickly grasp. The reality for me was that in a timed situation, I was either going to immediately have some insight into the problem, or I wasn't (and if I didn't get it immediately, spending 10-20 minutes on it was not likely to help). I felt absolutely terrible after both tests, but the average turned out to be in the 40s or 50s for each one, so as long as you meet or exceed the average, you should be fine. Another tip--the graders *want* to give you points. Write down _anything_, even if you know it's not totally right or if it seems silly. You never know--you might end up getting a fraction of a point. And for this class, every little bit helps. \n\nPart of the stress for me with the tests was the ProctorTrack system that was used. I was terrified that my internet connection would drop, someone would come in the room, or some other infraction would occur and I'd fail. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThis is only my second class, but the TAs all were very helpful, I thought. They were empathetic with students and were encouraging during office hours. They held frequent office hours and had \"watch together\" sessions. They were also very available on Piazza (at least compared to the other class I've taken). Dr. Pryby was also fairly active on Piazza. One feedback that I think most students had was that the office hours should be recorded. There was some pushback from the instructors on this, but maybe they'll change it in future semesters. \n\nAs for the grading--for a class involving writing proofs, I thought the grading was quite fair. If you think about it, any error in a proof makes the entire proof totally invalid. From this perspective, getting partial credit is generous. Show all of your work, and if you're not sure if you should include or explain something--just go ahead and do so. This should go without saying, but participate in as much extra credit as you possibly can. You need every point you can muster. \n\nBooks:\nJust go ahead and get both of them. At some points during the semester, I needed a combination of book + videos to understand the concepts. In many cases, the books were much clearer than the lectures. CLRS is probably worth having on your bookshelf anyway. \n\nConclusion:\nThis was a very rewarding class. I feel like the my knowledge of the foundations of computing is now very solid. At the same time it was extremely stressful. I wouldn't recommend taking it and expecting an A if you have other life commitments. Good luck!",

It really does require knowledge of about 36 white papers in order to answer the questions on the exams. I came across 3 questions on each of them that i had no idea what paper they came from, let alone what they were referring to. I spent days cramming, and re-watching the lectures. \n\nThe projects are not impossible, but are very time-consuming in order to write, debug and get to pass auto-grader, and corner-case testing, however, given enough time (2-3 weeks) you can complete them. I completed 2 of 4 with A's but they took 40+ hours to get that over 3 weeks. I am a novice C programmer, so that was my downfall. I'm sure others with a high level of C programming did them in half or less time, but they are covering subjects and APIs that we are given and forced to use, that come with no instructions, we had to fumble about them to figure out how to use them correctly. \n\nIOS will help, if you are not fluent with C. Overall this is definitely one of the harder classes in the program, BUT I did learn a lot, and I'm a better C programmer because of it. \n\nOH one more weird thing... the PIAZZA participation grade (3% overall), seems to be based on an algorithm of Days logged on, posts read, and contributions.

            "text": "It's pretty hard for me to give an accurate commentary on this class because I have such an unusual background, but I can only really give advice that would be applicable to the general population interested in taking this course. About 35-40% of the students will drop, and this has been consistent throughout the terms so far. General programming experience almost doesn't even matter, but having the right experience does. People with 10 years of programming experience struggled. For reference, I had maybe worked a job using a higher level language than C for about a few months before taking this course, and most of my academic and job experience was fairly nontechnical in nature. I did not even graduate in STEM. \n\nOf course, understanding C is necessary to do well, but I can promise you that not knowing C is NOT the primary limitation that most people will suggest. Being able to take a spec, design a solution, test it thoroughly, and refactor to apply the right patterns are far more indicative of whether or not you will succeed in this course. I didn't find the programming assignments particularly difficult, but a lot of people struggled against the autograder so a bit of gusto for debugging would certainly help you as well. You should still start the projects early so that you can let the ideas marinate in your head as you're going about your daily routine. The tests were nothing to write home about; just your standard review of the details will do. What helped me most was taking screenshots of key video stills into OneNote and maybe writing a few supplemental notes to jot down specifics as I listened along at 2x speed. That workflow was sufficient enough for me to grasp the material. \n\nGoing by the reviews, this, Machine Learning, and Algorithms are by far the most time-consuming classes. I heard somewhere that AOS was easier, but the statistics seem to reflect an equivalent success rate (~40% drop). All of these classes will expect different things out of you, and this course in particular should challenge your programming abilities relative to other courses. Operating Systems classes are notorious for having the most legitimate programming assignments, whereas Algorithms on the other end of the spectrum expect you to have a higher level of mathematical maturity and the ability to write proofs, which fewer people possess. I CAN give advice on the latter, but this is not the review for that :)\n\nInstructor and TA support was pretty top notch from what I saw, although this won't be the case for every single course in the program. So I would take the course just because the experience was well made and well-supported, but definitely make sure that you have the right background before signing up!",

This takes a while because you have to commit a good deal to memory, so make sure you go through these and also all of the previous midterms and finals (which they also post on T-Square), at least a week or two in advance of the tests. \n\nFinally, to prep for the course, I would strongly advise that you brush up on your C coding. You don't need to be a guru, but make sure you have your dev environment properly set up with a decent IDE, and especially know how to debug programs. I didn't have to use valgrind for any of my projects thanks to the copious amount of unit tests that I wrote, but for the final project I did use valgrind to help me locate a bug.

Either you watch it 3, 4 times to finally get it, or find a 20-min YouTube video that covers the same material but is easier to follow. In a way it's good because you'll end up learning so much. However it's very time consuming and there's a lot of responsibilities on the students. The recommended books are helpful too. \n\nHomework: the problems are interesting but tough. Most requires some tricks. Try your best to complete all. You effort will be rewarded on the exams. Start early. Twice I started the homework on Saturday and had to stay up until 3am on Monday. I don't know if they'll continue to offer extra credit for doing peer reviews, but if they do, don't skip them. Any extra credit will help with your grade. \n\nExams: spending 3 hours with difficult problems are just brutal. On both exams I spent a lot of time on the 1st question just because I was too nervous. I didn't finish all the questions, but at the end I accepted my fate and turned it in. Expect to feel depressed after the tests and expect to get bad scores. Don't be too sad though since there's a big curve afterwards. The grading on the exams is more generous than the homework. If you writing down any clue, as long as it's in the right direction, you'll get more scores than you expect. \n\nTo get an A: take every assignment and exam seriously. Try to stay above 75% on everything. Unlike previous semesters, only ~16% got an A this semester. To get a B: try to stay above the average every time. ",

The result is vaguely worded tests, disappointing grades that are curved down, and core material that is still easy. \n\nThe lectures are good because they cover an interesting range of topics (a broader range than other networking classes I've seen). But they lack a bit in depth and need to be augmented. The current instructors are not the developers of the course and in some instances have a different approach. However they claim that they cannot change a single video segment or annotate it because \"it is easier to redevelop the entire course than it is to change one bit of it. \" I find this claim ridiculous at best. \n\nThe projects are very interesting but a bit easy. Those can definitely be made more challenging. \n\nThe quizes are a mess. They're vaguely worded and depend on the instructor's interpretation. They tend to be open ended, but you're expected to answer with a multiple choice or be constrained to 200 words. And in most cases, you're penalized because either you missed a nuance that's only clear in the instructor's mind, or because you didn't elaborate (although you're constrained to 200 words). My grades were like a crap shoot, totally random per quiz, for an equal amount of preparation for each quiz and understanding of the material. \n\nThe office hours were like a morning radio show with banter and little substance. I can tell that the instructors were trying hard to curve down the grades. Initially they claimed that an A will only be 92 and above (they reduced it later to a 90). They finally settled on the vaguely worded tests to make the course appear to be hard even though that's the wrong way to do it. ",

I assure you, as someone who had a couple of C-heavy courses in undergrad and no professional experience with the language, it is not that bad. They give you a ton of code and the assignments kind of write themselves once you get the hang of what they are after. Even so, you should probably expect to spend 20 to 30 hours on two of the four projects. Don't bother with the extra credit options on the projects unless you really want to. They will add quite a bit of additional time while only affecting your grade by about 1% each. \n\nLectures/Tests\nThe lectures are a little slow paced. I watched most of them on speed-and-a-half, which increased my focus considerably. The midterm and final ask detailed questions from the lectures and also contain quite a bit of application material. Strive for understanding of the lectures, rather than memorization, and you'll be fine. \n\nOverall comments\nI got an A in this class without having to sweat too much, mainly because the curve is generous - 81 to 100 was an A in fall 2015. It's an enjoyable class with some interesting material that I didn't encounter in undergrad. Biggest complaint: nothing got graded until the middle of the semester, because nothing was really due until then. The first project is already divided into four deliverables. Releasing separate grades for those components would help students who are unsure of where they stand. ",

In order to do well, you must read and understand the papers, which can be long and dry depending on the topic. There are lots of papers to read. \n\nThe projects were interesting and not trivial. If you are well versed in C, then there wont be a big problem.

            "text": "It was a very challenging course yet I enjoyed it very much. I did some theoretical computer science research during my undergraduate study. Therefore I am quite familiar with the all the course materials yet still it's very challenging for me. \n\nThe first half of the course was about Turing Machine, Decidable, Recognisable and NP-complete, NP-hard. It requires very strong math proving skills. It's ok if you don't understand these concepts prior to the class. Nevertheless, you should be comfortable with reading the proof and checking if one proof is correct or not and writing proofs you know for sure is correct. If you don't know whether you can do these, try to prove quick-sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and is O(nlogn) in expectation. Try to prove that fibonacci series equation\nF_n = (a^n-(-a)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2 by mathematical induction. Also the HW0 is somewhat similar to these problems. If you are not comfortable with HW0, drop the course immediately. \n\nThorough out the first half of the course, you should find that most proving problems follow a pattern. For example, how to prove something is undecidable, you reduce it to HALT. how to prove something is decidable, you find a decider. How to prove something is NP-Complete, you first prove it's in NP by providing a verifier verifies the instance in polynomial time and second you reduce the problem to some known NP-Complete problem. As long as you follow the proving patterns, you are in the right direction. Google for solutions of the homework also helps but make sure you understand it and then close the webpage and write your own proof and cite the website in the homework. \n\nThe second half of the course focuses on solvable problems and polynomial time algorithms. While implementing the algorithm is mandatory in the homework, it still places most of the attention on proving the algorithm is correct and analysing the time complexity. Some basic graph concepts and algorithms like bfs, dfs and shortest path will help. Learning these algorithms doesn't mean you can implement the algorithm. Instead, it means you know how to prove the correctness of the algortihm (like what I said, you know for sure your proof is valid) and you know how to analysis the time complexity. \n\nThe homework is hard but try doing all homework including the bonus as much as possible. I particularly enjoy the moment when I solve the problem after 3 hours intensive thinking. Also, I personally think it's better to handwrite all the homework so that writing proof for middle exam and final exam won't be uncomfortable. I don't have much suggestions for the exams. Try doing your best. \n\nHope you all doing well on this course. ",

            "text": "It's not a good sign when a TA calls a test question \"ridiculously counter-intuitive\", and comments that he too would have chosen the incorrect answer. \n\nIf you are intent on thoroughly learning the material presented in this course, beware: Your grade (especially your test grades) may not reflect your knowledge. A large portion of your time will be spent trying to figure out semantics of obscure test questions, troubleshooting faulty project templates, and arguing with instructors. \n\nIt is true the content of this course does not demand a large number of hours per week to read or watch. However, the open-book format of the tests is IN NO WAY an advantage. The “select all that apply” multiple-choice scheme was deemed unfair by MANY students, mostly because of the way T-Square deducts points for incorrectly selected options. Watching the lecture videos, reading the papers, and even participating in office hours do NOT lay the path for scoring well on the tests. \n\nThe projects can be a good source of learning the material, despite the fact they are 80% reading instructions and looking over the supplied templates and 20% actually writing code. \n\nIn the Fall 2015 session, the instructors were mostly attentive to students’ concerns (via Piazza and office hours), even if some answers included “that’s just the way it is, it cannot be changed. ” (This was a common response referring to tests in T-Square). I think the instructors were probably doing the best they could with the atrocious class they were given. However, I doubt any of them would have tolerated the mishaps we students had to deal with. \n\nCONCLUSION: This class needs to be scrapped and totally redone. Both the original content and the delivery of that content are atrocities to the OMSCS program. As stated below, this class IN NO WAY does justice to this VERY important field of Computer Science. If you decide to take this class, and learning the material and scoring well is important to you, PREPARE TO BE THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATED. ",

            "text": "For the most part this is an \"intro\" course for finance, machine learning, and the programming libraries used (numpy, pandas, and python in general really). If you are already an expert in all of those areas then this course will probably not be very informative, but otherwise the course should work well as a first look at those topics. Especially if you are a novice programmer, I would recommend this as one of the few in the OMS program that involves a lot of coding but does not assume much previous coding experience. In terms of both finance and machine learning, only the very basics are covered, but you will get practical experience working with both in the assignments which can help if you decide to pursue each further in the future (such as by taking the Machine Learning course). \n\nIn terms of the course structure, it is heavily programming project-based. The early assignments are very simple but the later assignments become more involved and give more room to go beyond the minimum requirements for extra credit. In the semester I took the course, there were many major problems with grading the assignments which was the only major downside of the course in general. Assuming those issues are resolved for future semesters, the assignments overall are fun and apply the material from the course well. The course was supposed to have both a midterm and a final exam, but the final exam was cancelled due to logistical reasons. The midterm exam was fair in terms of questions although it did involve a lot of memorization for things like library API details and financial formulas. \n\nOverall I would say that if you are interesting in learning the basics of these topics and like working on small programming projects this course is a good choice.

            "text": "This is a very fun course that is heavily project-based, and most of the projects are at least partially open-ended. The assignments are a mix between structured programming assignments that implement specific algorithms covered in the lectures and non-programming assignments that involve more of a focus on photography and using software to manipulate your photos. For most of the assignments completing the assignment as specified correctly only earns a 90% score (which is the cutoff for an A grade in this course) and you are on your own to figure out some way to go \"above and beyond\" to earn the last 10%. I really liked this aspect of the course because it let me pursue my own ideas and experiment with the material from the course on my own. There is also an open-ended final project that can be done individually or as a group, and a final exam. The final exam does a good job covering all of the material from the course and is open-notes, so if you understand the material in the course you should be able to get a good score on it. The overall workload of the course is flexible, especially if you try to go above and beyond for every assignment, and in general you will be rewarded for putting a lot of effort into the course even if your end results are not amazing. \n\nIn terms of what you should know going into the course, general Python and numpy experience will be helpful since there is a fairly large amount of programming in the course, although for the most part the assignments mainly involve understanding how to apply the algorithms from the course rather than involving much complex code. Being familiar with the math used in the course is also very helpful (especially matrix operations which are heavily used) although the lectures do an excellent job of explaining things. Also having a high quality camera is not required, but having a camera that has manual settings for things like exposure time makes many of the photography-based significantly assignments easier (as does having a tripod for your camera). The lectures do not assume any previous knowledge about photography, digital images, or the algorithms used in the course, but those topics are covered in a lot of detail so there is a lot to learn from this course. \n\nOverall I would say if you are interested in photography and image manipulation and want to get some practical experience with both this is a great course.

            "text": "Unlike some, I do not have a very favorable opinion of this class. I did learn quite a bit. But the bottom-line; the amount of time used was excessive compared to the value of the knowledge gained. So, a highly inefficient learning experience overall. I have a strong CS background. As an undergraduate, I received a 3. 97 GPA for my computer science work and have received an A in every other class in the OMSCS program that I have taken for a grade except for this one. In this class, I received a B. In fact, only 16% of the students in this class received an A, and as can be seen by looking at Course Critique (https://critique. gatech. edu/course. php?id=CS6505), the grade distribution with the current instructor is skewed in a direction generally unfavorable to students. So beware, if you choose to take this course, you are in for a huge amount of work and perhaps a significant amount of stress. In my opinion, it would be perfectly reasonable to choose your specialization such that you could avoid this class. Alas, at the moment that would mean that you specialize in Interactive Intelligence, although there might be other ways to dodge this class while specializing in Robotics or Machine Learning in the future if they expand their algorithms offerings. Anyway, in my opinion, this class isn't going to give you any deep insights about the world; but it will seriously mess up your schedule for the semester. It is a perfectly reasonable choice to choose your specialization specifically so you can avoid this class. \n\nThe current instructor, Chris Pryby, has a Ph. D. in mathematics, not in computer science. Not surprisingly, this class has a certain bias towards mathematics. I would say that the way that the class was administered in Fall of 2015 that it is about 80% math and only 20% computer science. Of course, if the instructor were to change, it is perfectly possible for this bias to change as well. To make the point: if you were to choose your undergraduate major based on your desire to complete this class, I would recommend that you major in math rather than computer science. Alas, since most of you have probably finished undergrad, this is a useless point as a practical matter but very important in terms of how you should prepare yourself for success in this class. What is important in this class is not so much your ability to implement any algorithm or concept, but instead to produce mathematical proofs that relate to them. \n\nAs a side note. The mathematics in this class is not particularly hard. I had a colleague at work who was a mathematics major before receiving his Ph. D. in bioinformatics assert that the level of mathematics in this course appeared to be at about an undergraduate level when he saw what I was doing as far as the homework. It is not the formal level of mathematics in this class that makes the course hard, it is the way that this mathematics is taught (or more accurately, really not taught in the class) that makes the course hard. Basically, for this class, you either know the mathematics (including proof techniques) already or you are going to have to teach yourself. I would personally put this up as one of my pet peeves about the course. (And full disclosure, I have several such pet peeves). The lectures are sort of computer science oriented and sometimes even interesting when Lance Fortnow was in the picture. But the homework is really all math. And the math in the homework is not anything that is covered in the lectures. So, if you are someone who likes to learn from lecture like I do, you will be at a disadvantage, because you are going to have to teach yourself any undergraduate-level math concepts you are missing from the Internet or from a textbook or whatever on your own. And you had better hope, based on previous experience, that how you setup the problem is sensible, because there will not be any feedback in terms of lecture about how to solve problems UNLESS you try to find a lecture recorded for some other class that covers the same topic, which can be a hit or miss endeavor. Anyway, as a practical matter for those reading this review, here is my advice. Don't watch the lecture and expect it to help you with the homework, the midterm, or the final all that much. Indeed, there is only a limited relationship between the lecture and the things that determine your grade. Instead of focusing too much on the lecture, I would recommend that you focus on the homework problems and consider the lecture but one resource that MIGHT sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the cs-themed math problems that are the bread and butter of this course. As often or not, an outside resource will be more valuable to you than the actual lecture. Do not be surprised by this. For example, at the beginning of the class, I would highly recommend a strong focus on the \"optional\" Sipser textbook in particular. (Oh, and don't be fooled by the syllabus. There is nothing \"optional\" about the recommended textbooks UNLESS you already own a textbook that is substantial similar. ) In fact, if you are taking CS 6505, why are you even reading this review? You should be reading Sipser. \n\nA note about office hours. In the Fall of 2015, there were two types of office hours. Office hours where lecture was watched together and office hours that covered the homework. As I was taking two classes, I personally did not have time to show up to many \"watch together\" type office hours. But the few I did go to were not all that useful. But don't get confused. If you find the \"watch together\" office hours less than useful, don't make the mistake of assuming (like I did early on), that the office hours are a waste of time. In fact, the office hours that go over the homework are pretty much must watch for most people. Indeed, if I were to take the class over again, the first thing I would do when I received the homework is review it and try to complete as much of it as possible before office hours covering that homework is held. Then you will be well-positioned to maximally benefit from office hours and just maybe, have something resembling a normal life. As others have mentioned, it is in office hours that many of the \"hints\" to the \"tricks\" that will otherwise end up consuming your entire life are given. Thus, being properly prepared for office hours is often the only efficient means of solving the homework and the way to steal back some free time from this time-sucking course. So, do not make the mistake I did, which is to insist on watching the lectures before attempting the homework. The lectures (which still are not optional) probably will not help you that much with the homework anyway. Just as often, it will be some third-party source of information that is key. I would also argue if you are a visual learner who likes to learn from seeing others work out problems, that Chris Pryby's office hours should not be skipped, since he has a tablet and works out problems. Other TAs often resort to typing out math in chat, which, in my opinion, barely works and is highly inefficient even when it does work. Oh, and if your schedule doesn't allow you to make it to office hours one week? At least in the Fall of 2015, too bad. Office hours are not recorded like they should be in order to give everyone the same access to the same information. People who have time in their schedule for office hours will have an information advantage over those who do not. (And this is especially critical, because while the lectures often aren't that helpful to solving the homework, midterm, or final, the office hours do cover that sort of information. ) \n\nAnother point. The title of the course Computation, Complexity, and Algorithms. Low and behold, other courses offered at Georgia Tech, but not yet to OMSCS students include Computational Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms. CCA includes all of these topics, albeit on a sort of superficial level. You would think that since all of these topics are covered, that the course would focus heavily on the interrelationships between them. But despite some noises in the lectures about such interconnections, that is far from the focus in the class. No or little knowledge of interconnections between these topics will help you in the homework, midterm, or final. Anyway, my experience in this class was essentially this. At just about the time I start feeling comfortable, maybe even competent, dealing with one area, it is time to move on to the next. So, don't expect to acquire an especially strong foundation or confidence in any of the topics above as a reward for taking this class (although you should have a reasonable introduction). Maybe the exception is computation, but for that, I would credit the excellent Sipser book, much more than this class. Also, the earlier lectures are much better than later lectures. \n\nAnyway, I am nearly done with my rant. As you might infer from the tone, I did not much like this class. My view is that it is too much work for too little return. Something to be endured, not enjoyed. If CCA were a stock, I would sell it short. But that said, if you take this class, you will learn a lot. It is just that you will have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in learning it. (I feel I would have benefitted more from self-study, where I would control the agenda. ) In terms of grading, you can expect low scores that are then generously curved. But in the end, as a practical matter, much of the class is nearly as much of a test of pre-existing knowledge and mathematical skills as anything else, especially when it comes to setting up problems or figuring out the cute \"tricks\" necessary to get to the end. (And it shouldn't have to be said, but knowing how to setup the problem is probably 50% of the challenge. So focus on that first. ) And while I have seen classes that grade on a curve being well-done, in this case, I believe the curve disguises the fact that the course designers do not have a particularly clear agenda regarding what skills and knowledge they actually expect students to acquire from the class. It is more of, lets test them on a bunch of stuff and see what sticks sort of thing. A curve can (in theory) be the most fair way to grade students; but it can also be a way of concealing flawed course design. In this particular case and for this particular class, I believe it is the latter not the former. \n\nNow, there is a particular sort of person that enjoys this class. And without exception, I believe that what sets those people apart is that they are very well-prepared in terms of mathematics and perhaps in terms of schedule (probably they are only taking one course). As I have said, neither the mathematics nor the insights in the course are all that hard, in retrospect. But what is hard is the amount of material you are expected to cover with inadequate time to cover it systematically and thoroughly due to the lack of a focused and clear learning agenda. For those who come into the course with very solid skills (such that they probably do not even need to take the course, really), then it is a pretty fun problem-solving experience. Maybe it even hits the sweet spot for optimal learning. For everyone else who is going to take this course, I do not believe that you will find this course to be anywhere close to enjoyable or a great use of your time relative to the reward. I certainly did not enjoy the class or feel that it is was a good use of my time. But then again, I am not a math major. Perhaps if I had been one, I would have enjoyed this course too. ",

However in the end I felt it was worthwhile and the projects gave a lot more hands-on practice with some of the methods we studied in the class. \n\nThe first half of the class can be a bit daunting in terms of the amount of material for the midterm - Supervised Learning covers a lot of lectures and most of the textbook for the class. The latter half of the class is a bit less material with respect to studying for the final. In that respect you should try to stay on or ahead of the schedule and readings so you don't feel overwhelmed getting prepared for the midterm. \n\nIn terms of the projects, the first one can feel daunting as you must select two datasets to use for this project (and reuse them for parts of later projects) and then apply a bunch of supervised learning methods to the data sets and then compare and contrast. Without giving things away, I would say on that first project try to focus on getting some plots that will help you to compare the algorithms in terms of different parameters, error rates and runtimes. Having the plots is really crucial to doing well on the assignments. As I moved on through the course I also found it helpful to write the report as I went along instead of running a ton of experiments and then trying to write it up at the end - since only the report matters for the project grades the most important thing is to start putting words (and plots) to paper, and that can help with \"analysis paralysis\". \n\nUse the software you are comfortable with for the class. Whether you prefer Python, R, or Java stick with what you like and you will probably be happier. But also the randomized optimization project has a MIMIC implementation in the ABAGAIL package (Java) and the reinforcement learning project works well with BURLAP (Java), and using those may make things easier for those projects. \n\nIf you do use java and want to get a head start on the class one activity that would be useful it watching the Weka tutorial, which walks through how to load data in Weka and use the different classifiers and classifier parameters in Weka. Learning to use either the Weka CLI or APIs to programmatically run classifiers is also helpful as you can use that to run a series of experiments to see how tuning parameters in the learning algorithms impacts the results. \n\nFinally believe Charles when he says not to panic on the midterm results. The mean on our midterm was around 50/100 but that corresponded to the equivalent of an A, and the B range was 20-30 points and up. So even if you feel bad about the midterm don't give up, submit all the projects and you should end up okay. ",

Overall, I'm glad I took this one as my first in the program. \n\nFor me, the bulk of the time was spent on writing, including thinking about topics, drafting, and editing. In a perfect world, I would prefer to trade some of the writing time and spend it on the optional reading assignments instead. To illustrate the volume, the word count heuristics from the teaching team led to about 15k words in total across all the assignments. I recommend front loading and starting with a strong, steady pace early in the semester. \n\nThe work included a mix of written assignments, code/applied projects, project write ups, exams, and peer feedback. This mixture resulted in a nice balance to the grading, with no one assignment making up the bulk of the course grade. The balance of broad topical coverage with more deep dives in the assignments was also good. \n\nThe teaching team was really great, and the feedback and grades on assignments were returned in a very timely manner. Piazza provided plenty of interesting reading and interaction for those so inclined, from both the teaching team and the students. There were plenty of office hours, and even some optional sessions with external professors on relevant topics. ",

By the end of it, you learn an amazing amount of material. I seem to be in a minority, but I felt the embedded quizzes were great (despite typos & errors) and really helped to reinforce the course material. You can always hit the skip to answer button if you run into trouble. You got credit for just attempting the quizzes. \n\nThere is a partner option for the last two projects which was great. That became an important channel of communication for working out issues that were not addressed via Piazza. \n\nGenerally positive -- I quite enjoyed the project and felt like the effort level involved was quite reasonable (8-15 hours). If you cannot read C++ or figure out undocumented code you will have trouble. This is a real academic simulator, written by people just trying to get things done; commenting was a secondary concern. The actual coding you do is 20-50 lines, the trouble is just figuring out where they go. Having read horror stories about multi-hour simulations from prior terms, I was pleasantly surprised that the simulations took only a couple of minutes. \n\nThe Major issue (as stated by others) -- was the Piazza interaction with the professor & TAs. Office hours were cancelled for a few weeks, then disappeared altogether. Logistics around projects and exams were poorly communicated. Halfway through the semester instructor (professor / and especially TA) participation fell off a cliff. Shockingly, there was no formal announcement for the Final Exam!\n\nOverall -- the content is great, but be prepared to have to figure things out on your own. Make sure you take the lab partner option as he/she will be one of the best resources to resolve issues that you are unable to post publicly to Piazza. ",

Bomb a test, and it could drop you a letter grade. \n- Projects: Not much assistance was offered, and if you got stuck on a coding issue, not much help was available (except from Piazza, see above)\nTIPS for the CLASS:\nIf you are thinking about taking this class, here are some useful tips:\n- PYTHON - make sure you have good Python programming skills. If not, you will struggle with the projects. The class assumes you can write Python programs. \n- If you didn't take an undergraduate Networking class, consider getting the suggested textbook: Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach. This was helpful\n- Attend (or watch afterwards) all the Office Hours - very helpful and critical to my passing the class (professor gives good hints on the tough test questions)\n- Read all the posts on Piazza. Again this provided hints and details on tough test questions. \n- And don't forget to have fun!",

I thought about quitting half-way through the class and received a C on the first homework BUT ended up with an A in the final course. \n\nThere are opportunities for \"extra credit\", where you can show that you have done extra work and get potential lift points if you're in between grades - it is not clear how this is done but it worked to my benefit. The class is very open about sharing algorithms (but not write ups) and discussion boards are full of people exchanging ideas and helping students that are stuck. Very collaborative class and it promotes open sources and sharing in the CS community. Also, I appreciated peer feedback because then I could see how other approached the same question & with different languages. \n\nThis class took over my life for a few months but I am a stronger technical person as a result.

            "text": "I really enjoyed this class. It helped me develop a good understanding of networking and I thought Prof Lillethun and the TAs did a really good job. I got a pretty high mark in this class (97), so I thought I would share a couple of tips that might help others that are planning to take it:\n\n1. As mentioned in the other reviews, some of the questions on the quizzes can be vague and easily misinterpreted. My approach on the quizzes was to make sure I researched each question throughly, considered all possible interpretations, and if necessary, post a private message to the Instructors requesting clarification. I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things. \n\n2. Use office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it. \n \n3. In advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them. \n\n4. T-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don't gamble on choices that you aren't sure of. \n \n5. T-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer. \n\n6. The projects aren't very hard, but you do need to have *some basic* programming. experience. If this isn't you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program). Prepare for the class by learning how to use basic data structures (maps, lists, sets), write methods, and declare variables. This is basic stuff, but a number of people seemed unprepared. ",

            "text": "This course is both very challenging and interesting. The word \"introductory\" in the title can be quite misleading. When I took this course, I presumed that the course teaches OpenMP and MPI. It doesn't. You are required to study these as part of the course and use them in solving the assignments. The course focuses more on algorithms and divided into 3 parts:\n\n1. Shared memory parallelism (OpenMP)\n2. Distributed memory parallelism (MPI)\n3. Cache based optimizations\n\nLectures: The course content is very good, but may require multiple readings/viewings before it can be assimilated. This was my 5th course, and my toughest so far. The instructor is hilarious. His jokes are very creative and funny and perhaps compensate for the heavy lecture material. \n\nAssignments: There are a total of 5 assignments. Of these 3 are reasonable. 2 are very tough (There are students who spent more than 40-50 hrs on an assignment and still couldn't complete it). If you get an assignment to work you get about 80-90% credit. The remaining 10-20% goes for performance improvements. The problem is that if you don't get the assignment to work, you lose big time. And that can be harsh, because many students spend most of their time just getting it to work. Do not underestimate the assignments and start early. Also, you need to be comfortable with C, C++ (especially pointer handling). Without this you will struggle in implementing some assignments. \n\nMidterms/Final exam: These can be quite tough. The midterm had a class average of around 19/50. The final exam had a class average of about 29/50. You have to be really well versed in the course content to do well in the exams. \n\nGrading: I do not know the exact grade distribution but based on the numbers shown on this website, the percentage of A's seem to be the lowest among current courses while the number of C's seemed to be the highest compared to current courses. Not the course to take if you want to get away with an easy grade. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in knowing more about HPC algorithms and are willing to work hard.

The second part has two projects: the first is the runaway project which involves some linear algebra. The second project is pretty open where you are free to implement any of the algorithms taught in the course to solve the problem. You can also use any other algorithm you want as long as you mention that in your report and say why you used that. \n\nTo prepare, I advise:\n1. having a python prior experience (Udacity: Intro to CS is a good refresher). \n2. Artificial Intelligence experience (briefly skimming through Udacity's Intro to AI lectures can be helpful)",

The teaching team is very responsive on Piazza but it can be difficult to find answers there because it seems a lot of students are struggling. ",

Consequently, we are often unprepared for homework assignments. This leads to focusing on getting things to work rather than learning how to solve problems the right way.

That apparently isn't the goal of the course because the instructors spend their time hand-waving and the assignments have you spend time debugging against shoddy tools. You won't learn to troubleshoot the thought process or algorithms, just to fiddle at the margins with the tools provided. The people who give this course favorable reviews are very strong coders but very weak on theory and math; they pull through because they can plug & chug the coding assignments and use the crappy tools. Based on other reviews, many students thought the math in this course was challenging. It is basic freshman/sophomore calculus, but a lot of people didn't come into this program with that. If you consider yourself a math person, take Andrew Ng's classes on Stanford Engineering Everywhere. That's what real Machine Learning looks like, not the plug-and-chug coding of this course. \n\nIn this course you will get a lot of practice running algorithms that are poorly explained. I have a math / physics background and am floored by how superficial -- yet still time-consuming -- the total coverage, problem sets, and exams were. The questions involve running algorithms and interpreting output, which is about as crank-turning as I could imagine. Still, it takes a lot of time to do because the tools (except Weka) are weak and the lectures exceedingly hand-wavy. I found the book much more clear (though dry) in its explanations than the lectures. Neither were helpful on any of the assignments.

Over the break I spent some time studying Java to prepare, but was pleasantly surprised that I've been able to do all the assignments using Python! :-) Now the course is Python-friendly, so Pythonistas are welcome. In short, another excellent OMSCS course, taught by reinforcement learning experts. I highly recommend it!!",

When the professor designed the course, I doubt he realized how time-consuming it would actually be. \n\nIt took me 2-2. 5x as much time as Machine Learning (7641) did. As mentioned below, the time-spent-to-amount-learned ratio is not very good. I probably spent about 5% of the time actually learning and 95% of the time hacking away / throwing everything against the wall to get something to work. Many classmates had similar feelings. \n\nOne of the (4) homeworks took me about 12 hours just to get the very first part correct - worth 5 points; and that step was necessary to move on with the rest of the assignment. On another assignment I was stuck on the first section for an entire week and spent around 30 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. The students on Piazza and the TAs are helpful, but when you are truly stuck, too bad - you'll get a bad grade. What's worse is that the TAs don't share the correct solutions with you afterwards. Because of this, I feel like there's a lot I didn't take away from the class. \n\nThe class frequently has guest lecturers, which seem extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the instructors never shared any of the videos past March 1st, so the majority of talks were never shared with OMSCS students. Students asked about this on Piazza (several times) with no response from the teaching team. \n\nThe final project is enjoyable, but my mentor didn't make things easy. For the project, my mentor was supposed to upload a large. csv file to a Postgres database, but 2 days before the due date he still couldn't get it working -- which led to me having to re-write a significant portion of my code. I spent about 20 hours debugging this, but still couldn't get it working - because of that, I was forced to use a smaller dataset (which I'll be punished for). \n\nThis course has a lot of potential, but desperately needs to be re-designed and have the professor more actively involved.

            "text": "TL;DR: This is a fascinating class, but seriously consider taking it by itself. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Fascinating topics (OpenMP, MPI, caching)\n-Dr. Vuduc keeps the lectures lighthearted and interesting. \n-You get 2 \"48 hour\" late passes to turn projects in late with full credit. \n-You get a \"48 hour make your performance better\" period if you don't like where your grade is after they're released. This only applies if you actually turned something in though. They take the top result, so you don't need to worry about your grade going down. \n-The Piazza forum is active (with both the TAs and Dr. Vuduc replying). \n-Grading is fair. \n\nTHE BAD:\n-The projects take a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. Even with a very good knowledge of C/C++ I found that I was still spending 30-40+ hours on each project (except for lab0). Heed what others are saying. Do *not* wait till the weekend they're due. \n-The Udacity \"autograder\" can be a complete pain in the behind. At times the output isn't very helpful on why it failed. On top of that, the TAs generally don't expound upon what the grader is actually testing. Depending on the project, you can spend a significant amount of time just passing the autograder. \n-The projects have *roughly* a two week cadence. So you're always going to be working on something for this class (circle back to comment in the TL;DR). \n-Office hours aren't consistent. We'll have one every week and then nothing for 2-3 weeks. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe class averaged 23. 8/50 on the midterm and it was curved to being out of 40. While they didn't have to curve at all; this meant the majority of the class got a D or lower on the exam. Some of us were disappointed that last semester the average was 19/50 and it was curved to out of 30. To be fair though, two people got above 40 which is what likely \"broke\" the curve. \n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS:\n-Have a good working knowledge of C/C++. Especially pointers. \n-Go to (or watch) the office hours. \n-Give the class the time it needs. ",

Grading is okay, though the requirements are not always 100% clear. Also the workload distribution is not even so be sure to jump into the assignments very early on, especially the first few. Another downside of the heavy workload that the TAs can't always keep up the pace either, some assignments took quite long to return and we had to submit at least 3 assignments before we got our first feedback. All these result in a lot of noise on Piazza, you have to go through 10K+ posts on piazza during the semester if you want to keep up. \n\nThey dropped MATLAB Fall2015, from now on you can only do your homework in Python. And unless you are good at Python (including advanced things like optimization and parallelization in NumPy), you'll spend a few nights debugging for sneaky bugs or screaming over algorithms that run for 40 minutes. \n\nAll in all: it is a good class but there is a room for some improvement.

He more or less establishes a standard (most consider it on the overzealous side of the spectrum) and grades accordingly. It is rather appalling to take a course where the instructor doesn't instruct, the lectures are given by a previous instructor and TA, but they aren't always on target with the course requirements and the level of rigor that is required, the instructors are somewhat responsive on the forum (the only clsas contact is via Piazza), office hours are explicitly NOT conducted, and NO outside resources or collaboration are allowed on homework! Basically, self-teach, but you're not even allowed differing perspectives to help really solidify what the student is supposed to learn. Sure, there are problem sets that are circulated that students are allowed to collaborate on and use outside resources for, but there really isn't much time to do those if focusing on the required homeworks first. Also, it's more miss than hit that the instructor will provide solutions to the practice problems to know if you're getting it or not. If you're up for a quite hefty challenge that definitely is a psychological one as well, go for it, but know it will be rough. It's fairly demoralizing, and I've taken undergrad algorithms, theory, discrete math and proofs within the past 7 years! There were some changes between this past fall and the present semester, but unless they make MAJOR changes to where this course is actually taught and supported, I'd recommend going with the II specialization unless you're determined to struggle for the specialization you really want. I understand it's a tough subject and students should expect a challenge, especially from an institution like GA Tech, but the department really should evaluate their strategy for this one. Also, check the instructor's reviews prior to the program... not very positive previously w/ other subjects!",

The class covers a wide swathe of the machine learning spectrum. The lectures themselves don't get too deep, but they do a good job of familiarizing you with a lot of concepts. \n\nThere is quite a bit of supplemental reading, both with the primary text and several other papers. Not so much as AOS had, but still a fair amount. \n\nProfessor Isbell and the TAs are pretty responsive on Piazza. Elijah has been very active and helpful in particular. \n\nThe bulk of the difficulty comes with the projects. They are very open ended: you can use whatever data sets or framework you want to complete them. All of the coding and experimentation is just a set up for the analysis you write, which is the real centerpiece of a project. Writing a good analysis requires really understanding what is going on and will require a fair amount of independent research, above and beyond what the lectures and supplemental reading provide. It's tough, but I find that it gives a thorough understanding of the area. For me each of the projects has taken around 50-60 hours to complete. They come at a two to three week cadence. Budget your time appropriately. \n\nFor some of the projects it is likely that you will end up using ABAGAIL, which is maintained by Pushkar. It's pretty solid, although it has some blemishes. My only complaint with it is that there are standing bugs in it which are fixed by several-month-old pull requests. You can go and find these yourself, but they really should be merged. \n\nI've only had the midterm so far, and I must admit it is probably one of the hardest I've ever had. It is intentionally hard. My understanding is not that it is meant to weed people out, but to separate the truly outstanding students. \n\nOverall, if you like machine learning and you're willing to take on a tough course, I highly recommend this one.

But by the second time I was getting a little tired of it, and now I'm working on v3 and I'm not so excited about it. \n\nThe reason is, I feel the project has devolved into a test of my image processing skills rather than an test of knowledge-based AI programming. I didn't mind that on a single project, but I wish we'd gotten to try something different for p2 and p3 instead of the same thing just harder. \n\nHowever, in the scheme of things, the project isn't too bad and the class remains really fun.

            "text": "TL;DR: You must be a very good with Python before taking. Assignments are vague and seem hastily prepared. Instructors and TAs good. Most problems probably due to first time offering\n\nIt's best to think of these class as seminar where the lectures are really only a cursory review of the material but you are then expected to do independent research to implement the assignments. (One assignment involving MCMC is covered in the lecture for only 90 seconds). Unlike many classes where the starter code provides a lot of the minutia functionality, this class you pretty much build from the ground up. The starter code when provided is sparsely documented and seems hastily prepared. Got the impression that each TA was assigned the task of creating one homework for the class, but then those assignments weren't tested or validated by the other TAs/Instructor prior to launch. In many of the other classes, (like Intro to CV or KBAI) the assignments, while hard, show polish from having been refined over the years rather than being rushed to meet production deadline. \n\nThe biggest problem though is that after an assignment, there's no follow up by staff as to what the right approach or solution might have been. Didn't get it solved? Too bad. Students aren't allowed to share solutions or general approaches after the fact either. Makes it hard to learn if you struggle with an assignment but then get no feedback other than a grade. There was discussion of this being due to Piazza. Hopefully on future iterations the TAs/Staff will figure out how to lock it down so that they don't have to worry about future students finding the previous class forums. \n\nApparently the curve is generous, so supposedly everybody will be getting Bs or As. I was getting a high A when I dropped. I dropped because of the lack of feedback. \n\nI'm optimistic that future iterations will work a lot of the 'first-time-offered' bugs out. ",

The nice part about this class is that while the assignments are very easy, that has given me a lot of time to spend with the assigned reading materials (compared to, say KBAI where I completely ignored the reading material in order to tackle all the graded exercises).

Nearly every single assignment due date has been revised once or twice. The staff acts as if this is a favor to the students to keep pushing out the dates, but it makes it extremely hard to know what's going on with the course. On top of that, they promise that assignments and documents will be released by certain dates and VERY consistently actually release them several days later (and often push the due dates out in response). \n\nThe lectures are fine. They do a pretty good job of covering the current healthcare situation in the US and different IT solutions/problems to these. Every 2-3 weeks another little quiz is due that tests whether or not you've watched the lectures - I can mostly ignore these until they're due, watch the group of lectures on fast forward in less than an hour, and then take the (open book/notes) quiz using the lecture transcripts for reference. The amount of useful knowledge I feel like I gain from the lectures is minimal. \n\nThe project is ill-defined and we have been able to receive little useful feedback from the assigned TA. It doesn't help anything that the grades and feedback for each assigned deliverable is extremely late (you get feedback from the last assignment nearly by the time the next one is due) and not-at-all detailed. It's hard to know if the project is going in a reasonable direction for a solid grade. *shrug* I guess we'll see. \n\nThere was supposed to be some interesting programming exercises for working with FHIR. This was updated to be some quizzes instead. Apparently, they thought the Masters Computer Science students were too incompetent to figure out some programming exercises. \n\nGaTech really needs to reevaluate this one... Take this one if it's required or if you need easy credits. Don't expect that you'll get much out of it though. ",

If you're a working programmer like myself, you will probably already know this. \n* The grading on the group assignments is focused on the paperwork you produce, not the code. We turned in an assignment that failed half the instructor tests and still got an 80 or 85. \n* There is a significant amount of group work in this paper. I was in a different time zone to my colleagues and ended up doing 6am meetings most of the time. \n* I didn't really enjoy the material.

He and the TAs are insanely responsive and always have a nice mix of hints & wit in their replies. \n\nThe assignments start off pretty simple and ramp up near the end. The third section can be challenging but very satisfying to see things working. The lectures are really wonderful, and the textbooks are also fantastic, which is something I rarely say. \n\nMy sole complaint is a big one: the mid-term. Essentially the class compiles a list of questions for the mid-term, which culminates into a 700-question bucket. Those who did well largely memorized as much of this as possible. It seemed like a large amount of busy work and taking exams based on memorization is a pretty crummy way to spend a Sunday. \n\nSo prepare for a really great, fun course with one bummer in the middle. All in all, highly recommended. ",

The projects were cool and interesting(know your Python), once you figured out how to get started. That might be my one recommendation is that sometimes we really had no idea how to get started. They definitely expect the \"figuring it out\" part is the first step of each project and is crucial to understanding. The autograders were a bit scary, cause even when you got the project working, you were worried whether your project would pass or not. Our last project has an autograder we had access to, so we knew for sure. Hopefully that will become the norm. My advice, the projects are very doable if you start early. Those who waited really seemed to panic at the end. TA (esp Michael) were extremely communicative in Piazza, so use that site daily for questions and updated.

There were multiple times where I felt like I actually, thoroughly understood what the question was asking and how each of the answers worked, but still had to just guess which was the \"best\" answer. \n\nThe free response questions weren't as tricky, but only gave you 90-120 words to explain your solution. There were 2 times in the beginning where I was penalized for not including all the information - I knew the information that I had left out, I tried to imply it in the response as much as possible, but didn't know how to get it all in there given the short answer length. I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit.

The projects are very hard, but every one of them was something I've always wanted to know how to do - actually getting them implemented and learning how it all works is just incredible. The lectures cover an extremely wide range of topics, while there is sometimes more of an emphasis on the math than the intuition, you come away with a lot. \n\nThe projects you work on in this course are some of the coolest things I've ever worked on. If they offered another CV course with more projects like this, I would take it in a heartbeat. Seeing the output of an algorithm that you implemented to track a hand in a video for example, that's just awesome. \n\nThe time requirement is very real. The 2nd project, which turned about to be the longest, took me about 60 hours to complete. The math and linear algebra can be intimidating, and if it wasn't for the community on Piazza I don't think I would have figured out how to do certain things. As difficult as it is, the grading is very honest and the TAs are extremely helpful - if you put in the effort you will succeed. \n\nThis is a very challenging course but it is 100% worth it. I would HIGHLY recommend learning numpy and at least brushing up on opencv basics before taking this course. I think a better understanding of numpy and \"vectorization\" in particular would have saved me a ton of headache in the first half of the course. Also, I did not do this, but I wish I had taken Computational Photography first. There were a few posts on Piazza about how much that helped. ",

Not the most interesting material to read through but it is scientific papers so be prepared to read papers several times. I think on average there were 3-4 papers per week.

Good help from Piazza though. \n\nFrom looking ahead before I dropped there is A LOT of material you are tested on in the midterm/final study guides that comes directly from the papers. This might be the reason that the test grades are so low. \n\nI was excited to take the course but after spending just over a month in the course I'm glad I dropped it. Definitely information overload from the papers and trying to digest those left me exhausted when tackling the project.

It's the only time I can recall ever having to just completely give up on getting an assignment to work and just turned in something I know didn't work. A majority of the assignments were not too difficult and only took a few hours. On the other hand, the ones that were harder than average seemed almost impossible to complete. The lectures were very well done and he gives you just about everything you need to know to trudge and sweat your way through the exams. (The exams were open note... but they really aren't useful except to try to confirm some basic facts you aren't 100% sure of. ) That's because most of the time on the exam will be spent trying to decipher most of the questions that seem to be written as a brain teaser than an exam question. If the exam questions were more straightforward, I would be happier with this class overall. Do not try to cheat your way through this class. He will run your code through a plagarism detection system (MOSS). I didn't cheat, but it still stressed me out a lot that there were announcements saying people who cheated should confess or be reported to the dean. I would always worry that the system might flag my submission as a false positive when it was analyzed. This is probably the second most stressful class I've taken in the program. If I knew what I was getting into with this one, I probably would have just taken something else. The topics covered were far from what I was expecting. I wish they would break this into 2 classes... One for testing and one for analysis. I don't think I gained much personal benefit from the analysis part and very little useful knowledge from the testing part... Overall, a thumbs down from me. The biggest positive right now is that I took the final yesterday and I am just so happy that is over and done!",

I have never watched so many lectures from other schools in any course, because the gatech ones are so bad. There is little interaction between students because of the draconian plagiarism policy. No teaching. Just threats, dictates, and grades. I am riding it out mostly as an experiment and will not re-take it when I flunk. I am so glad this is not my first OMSCS class, because I would absolutely quit the program if it were. Treat this as a certification exam on your PhD level understanding of discrete math symbology and language, proofs (which many have not been bothered with since the 9th grade), and 1800 pages of at least 2 if not 5 incredibly dense textbooks. Know it up front, because you won't learn it from the class. A Computer Science class where you can't use a computer or calculator is just ironic and tragic. If you really want to learn this stuff you need to take this on-campus and choose your professor carefully. I see minimal value in the knowledge required to get an A in this class unless you are going into academia or just want to sit around with mathematicians and argue about P vs NP theory (I assure you the professional STEM world has better things to do). \n\nIt sounds like the course in Spring 2016 is MUCH different from previous semesters, so beware. In my opinion they are phoning it in now. ",

It also cries out for a Lab session environment where students can work on projects somewhat communally and get feedback from TA's in real time. The topic is fascinating, and the professor(s) are impressive so it is overall a good experience. The lectures are mostly just summary level though. You have to grind through the text and supplemental reading to understand it. The class needs more structure in the projects. The open-ended character of the process of choosing data sets and software environments for the projects makes it 10x harder than it needs to be. You can easily find youself wasting all your project time on trying to make these decisions. One important note is that the curve is very kind. Fight the urge to drop the class because of results and difficulty; it is worthwhile to stick with it. They seem to enjoy making everyone think they are failing and then curving to mostly A's and B's.

As a computer scientist you can expect pretty much every job interview to include algorithmic questions. This class will not prepare you at all for it. You spend most of the time figuring out how to encode Turing machines or theorizing about esoteric mathematical graph properties, both of very little use for computer scientists. The instructor really didn't do much throughout the entire class. His attitude is either you already know the material and you'll pass, or if you don't he can't really teach it to you. The lectures (prepared by another instructor) don't really give you the background needed to solve the homework or the exams as set by the current instructor. You mostly have to make up your own curriculum and hope that what you studied gives you the math background needed to barely pass this class. I don't recommend taking this class until they change the current instructor or he changes the way it's taught. When half the class drops by the withdrawal date and the remaining half gets a C or lower, you're really not teaching anything and you actually didn't do your job as an instructor, in my opinion. ",

            "text": "Unlike some others who have stated this class was super easy, I will contrast and state I thought it was very challenging. I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling. \n\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week. \n\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam. \n\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well. ",

I don't feel that it's hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it. I think the professor recognizes your efforts and as long as you are committed to learning the material (proving it by doing all the assignments and problem sets), then you should get at least a B. Another way to put it is that if you didn't get a B in this class, you probably weren't that surprised about it. \n\nIn terms of criticisms, this was my first course in OMSCS, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Certainly there seems to be a fair amount of growing pains in the program itself when it comes to addressing student concerns or giving out grades on time. But it also seems that the administrators recognize this and actively try to improve the environment for everyone. Over time I think some of these hiccups will iron itself out. A second criticism is that the book they recommend is a bit antiquated, given the level to which this field has evolved. It would have been nice if they upgraded to ESL or something similar. \n\nOverall though, I'm very happy that I took this course. ",

There was a fairly large gap between content the course provides and what was needed to actually complete the assignments, so most of what I learned in the course was through looking up tutorials and other course materials on the Internet. By far the biggest negative was the workload required for the first three homework assignments, I spent at least 40+ hours per week on the assignments over the six weeks that were given to complete them. The assignments themselves were not necessarily difficult to complete (although one assignment required deriving an equation used throughout the rest of the assignment which the course itself in no way prepares you for), but it's very much as if an entire semester's worth of assignments are crammed into that first part of the course. There were some other minor negatives to the course, mostly in the form of the course being disorganized and instructions being vague or conflicting. \n\nOverall I would say this could be a great course and I personally learned a lot from it, but I can't recommend it in its current form.

This class won't teach you advanced concepts around the stock market or ML but it gives you a solid base to build on. One of the pieces I really enjoyed was implementing the ML algorithms vs. just using them from a library like scikit. This class is all in python (which can be good/bad). As I already was familiar with python, the first couple of weeks were fairly easy other than learning the ins and outs of the numpy and pandas libraries. The projects definitely ramped up as the class went on but I really liked how the professor made each project build on top of each other. As long as you stay on top of your projects, build out your projects modularly, comment your code well, and don't overly procrastinate this class should be relatively straightforward. The midterm can be a bit tricky with the programming problems but the professor did provide a great study guide - use this and you will do fine on the midterm! Also, Professor Balch is extremely active on Piazza which was a nice surprise (I was not expecting this). Disclaimer: this was my first OMSCS class so I have no other OMSCS classes to compare this to. ",

Also this class is also going toward automated grading testcases, so without test harness, I could see many people have trouble getting good grade on their projects. Had all the optional parts (implement boosting, ling and knn analysis, all parts of the final project scaled evenly) and test harness not allowed to share, i could see the whole class drops half-to-one letter grade average. By the look of the grade of final project, probably less than 15% people actually implemented QLearning trades generator, which is really the whole point of the class. \n\nToward the end, you are building a QLearning agent to do automated trades generation, which is quite cool to detach QLearning from the more common \"robot in a maze\" application. The future offering is likely to disperse the loads a bit more so the end project isn't so compressed where the common time working on them is upward of 30-40 hours. The future iteration also going to bring back Decision tree next semester, and \"deep learning\" at some point. This course has the potential to mature into a really good course. ",

Congratulations!\n \nAny feedback without mentioning the lecture videos would, to me, be unfair. For ML videos to be not boring is a monumental task, but I, and I think remaining class shares this sentiment, rather enjoyed them and would listen to them in extended sessions. So, Congatulations on that too!\n \nThe assignments about 80/85% of the time are well managed and well explained, with a clear rubric set for students to meet. In comparison to other better-managed classes, I'd rate this aspect of the class up there with the best. \n \nOn the improvement side, I'd personally like to see following:\nMid-term question creation should be replaced with better directed assignments/projects. I didn't see any value in them. Sorry :(\nSome might not agree with me, but I think first mini-course should be left for students to explore. I'd rather start with Mini Course 2 and ML part immediately afterwards\nRight now, the course gives a touch of ML for Trading systems. I think this leaves room for more \"in-class\" experimentation. Perhaps more algorithms, ideas etc... I'd rank this course from easy-to-medium difficulty; but, I think it should be, with some more directed effort towards ML and its experimentation with Trading systems, medium-to-high difficulty range. \nLecture videos are so good that I would love to see more of them. Other ML algorithms, their analysis etc... Perhaps students don't have to be assigned tasks from them if it becomes too much, but still they can always see them and learn from them in their free time. \n \nI have had great fun with this course, and I hope everyone else has too.

However at time of taking this course I have never taken a traditional algorithm and data structure course which the class expects you to come with some knowledge. \n\nThe course surveys different testing tools and ways of deriving analysis. It requires a lot of exploration and research on the student's part which I think is largely why there are many negative reviews because in many instances you were stuck reading through pages of a specific API in order to complete one part of the assignment. For me at least I can say that this has largely made me a better programmer though it feels like a trial by fire. We had a pretty active piazza environment so I was able to make some pretty good strides. However, be aware that the instructor is a stickler for plagiarism, so absolutely it is to your benefit to write your own code by yourself. \n\nThe tests are open book, but it doesn't really help because it will be based more on your ability to apply the knowledge to problems. \n\nClosing statements, this was the first iteration of the course online so there were a couple of speed bumps.

If you are working and have a family, ensure that this is the only course you take that term. \n3. Struggle on the assignments - try as hard as you can on each of the problems. But don't be afraid to ask the TAs for hints and to Google for help (don't cheat, but ask for help and cite your references). \n4. The video lectures are not sufficient.

I did not get the pleasure of having David as the TA but I hear he is equally amazing. Dr. Goel makes this an extraordinary class and really keeps one engaged. The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved. ",

If you have recently taken something similar to CCA in your undergrad then the material in this course is not that hard. If you have been a programmer professionally for years and forgotten most of your undergrad then this course will be extremely difficult. The grading in Spring of 2016 was also very opaque and led to some unnecessary challenges. My advice for this class would be:\n\n1. Take this class alone. I am a single guy with no family and I would not want to have taken any other classes with this one. If you have any family I would highly recommend you take this class by itself. \n2. Do not ignore the pre-reqs. Make sure you satisfy all of them before you come in. \n3. This class is very mathy and proof based so be ready for that. I personally really like math and think it has its place inside a Computer Science degree from a research institution, but if you're expecting to be programming a lot you may get caught off guard. \n4. Do not take this class alone, make sure you are on a chat group with other students or very active on Piazza. \n5. Use all of the additional text books, especially if Sipser's is the main text book. I really like Algorithms by Dasgupta\n\nThis course is required for almost all of the specializations right now so you basically have to take it, but do not take it lightly.

There is usually a \"trick\" involved and once you figured it out things will just click. However, plan on some extra time for the static analysis assignments towards the end of the class. Some of the students spent hours and hours on the last assignment, (Constraint Based Analysis), and the solution is surprisingly concise at about 20 lines of code. \n\nThe midterm and final were pretty difficult. On the midterm there was a generous curve and the instructors said that there will be a similar one for the final. The material comes from the lectures and is expanded upon.

I'd feel torn at leaving it out. I had already taken the ML class and had to decide by myself if to learn R or Python while at the same time going through lectures and that was painful. So overall I'm on the side of leaving that part in but shortening it. \n\nI loved that professor asked to implement everything ourselves without relying to any library (other than numpy/pandas). There's nothing like implementing an algorithm yourself. Even something as simple as KNN has its tricks when implementing it. \n\nI loved that the assignments were somehow at par with the class. Every assignment is an increment over the last one. You get to build your own market simulator (or backtester). Stock trading strategies and then ML algorithms for it. \n\nProfessor was incredibly engaged throughout the class. He hosts several hangouts of an hour or more himself. He's amazingly active in piazza. Piazza becomes a firehose of posts and the professor replied to at least one third of them with followups. \n\nIf there would be a second part for this class I'd definitely sign up!",

            "text": "This class is not like any other class in the program (as of today). Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I'll concentrate on advice. \n1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don't expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don't, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). \n2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. \n3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. \n4) Don't expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. \n5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don't assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won't. Past [student] performance is no indication of your success [or failure]. \n6) Conversely to #5, feeling you are doing great in the 1st half is no indication of how you will do in the 2nd half. Persevere. \n7) Try out the class. It is a good experience. But don't be afraid to drop the class if you are doing poorly. There is no shame in not completing this class or switching to a specialization that doesn't require it. ",

From set theory and countability of infinite sets to graph theory and vertex covers and maximum matchings. There is a lot of math. The programs you will discuss are programs that will always output the reverse of the program given as an input, or a program that when run will output a program that when run that will output....

Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can. \n\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights. \n\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn't able to even find the solution to some of them. I'd recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you'll need every minute you can get. \n\nOn this course you don't work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you. That being said, make sure you collaborate with everyone else in the class. That was one of the reasons I was able to finish all the projects and end up with an excellent grade.",

            "text": "Content - The Udacity videos did a good job of presenting the course information. They presented the information in a pretty traditional, straightforward way (as opposed to the \"socratic\" approach of a class like ML), but they were sufficient. The quizzes embedded in the lectures were well-designed and more than just a trivial \"pick the right answer\". \n\nProjects - Favorite part of the class. Each project gave us a chance to use a tool in order to get hands-on experience with a topic covered in the lectures. Most of these tools required (or recommended) Linux in order to get consistent results. It would have been nice to start with a standard VM image, but it's also not difficult to set one up yourself. Regardless -- the projects were well-designed, relevant to the lectures, interesting, and most of all -- fun!\n\nExams - Both exams were open-notes. You could even use PDFs on your computer during the exam. Therefore, the questions on the exams required less rote memorization and more active application of the concepts learned. From what I've heard, most of the students that had trouble with the exams actually struggled more with ProctorTrack than anything else. That's unfortunate, but not really a knock on the exams themselves. The questions were fair and did a good job evaluating comprehension of the material. \n\nAdministration - The TAs and the professor were very active and helpful on Piazza. This is not necessarily always the case in other OMSCS classes, so it was definitely appreciated here. Most of the grading was done in a timely fashion, although a few of the assignments took longer than average. \n\nOverall - This class is an overview class -- you'll cover a lot of different topics, without going too far in-depth. The class is similar to CS 6035 in that regard. You'll get exposed to a lot of interesting ideas and use a variety of tools to explore those ideas, which hopefully encourage you to learn more in the future. I highly recommend this course. ",

A lot of the material has really stuck and I have been able to apply these principles to subsequent classes. \n\nI felt this class was more time consuming than hard. It takes a more hands-on approach rather than a theoretical one. There is a lot of time spent tinkering with data-sets and runing different algorithms. But, I never felt like I did not know how to do stuff or that the material was difficult to grasp, projects just took some time to iron out and decide how you wanted to procede with them. \n\nPersonally, I would have preferred a little more of a theoretical approach and deeper dive and increased focus on the underlying math, which was extremely light. But at the same time, this is a survey course that aims to cover a lot of topics, so perhaps it is not realistic to increase the depth too much without sacrificing breadth. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course!",

The course covers many OS topics with focuses on design and implementation of concurrency system, i. e. , CPU, memory, IO and file systems. I would say the course is well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are engaged, and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you into the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. I am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with C. This is mostlikely the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background and skill sets of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\". \n\nThe content of the course is really straightforward, i would rate the difficulty for the course content 3. However, the programming assignments are substantially more difficult for those who are not experienced with C. I rate it 4. 2. Given the fact that project assignment takes about 3 times more time than the course content, the weighted difficulty is 3. 9. \n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course. ",

The first two exams were essentially review for anyone who has done ER diagrams and relational modeling. The third and fourth exams were moderately difficult, with relational algebra/calculus and functional dependencies being the hardest concepts to master. Some of the exam questions regarding SQL were not everyday queries, so you did have to stop and think about what was being asked. Even though the exams were open book, not having lecture notes or some familiarity with the material would put you at a disadvantage. (Some students were \"kind\" enough to share their notes, and I'm surprised the instructors didn't put the kibosh on that. )\n\nConcurrent with learning about the theories, we had a group project assignment. As always, the most important factor is your fellow group members. I was lucky to have a hard-working team, which made me sad that there were no peer evaluations, as I would have gladly given them all positive feedback. (One problem with group formation is that there was a \"re-org\" deadline for groups to reform after a member dropped the course, that was before the final drop deadline. So some groups had less manpower if someone dropped after the \"re-org\". ) The timeframe for each phase of the project got progressively shorter and shorter, and so the effort level had to kick up a notch or two by the end of the semester. There was also a final WebEx presentation that didn't quite have all the kinks worked out, but was effective. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed this course and I found the later material very interesting and can say I learned something new. Dr. Mark, while no longer actively researching, clearly is an expert in the topic and has great opinions. The lead TA did a commendable job keeping things organized. It was a good experience. ",

What is the point of practicing without something to align yourself against? Your work is being sent off into a void. Vague homework feedback that mostly consists of \"you did the problem wrong\"? Yea, thanks. One TA grading something correct, another TA grading the same exact thing incorrect. Homeworks that consist of 3 problems that most people spend 20+ hours on... followed by exams that consist of 6 problems with only 3 hours? Right... The final exam had you calculating inverse matrices involving 1/12th fractions by hand? What is the point of that? And every single homework and exam problem demanded that you produce a solution in some exact particular format or way, yet you rarely have any glimpse into what that format or way should look like. I learned WAY more while enrolled in 6505 from simply watching video lecture material and reading PDF note packages from other non-OMSCS courses. I learned next to nothing from 6505 directly, and the entire course was an exercise in futile frustration. For comparison, I took ML... ML was a tough class, but doable if you invest the time. 6505 is something else entirely. Avoid this course at all costs. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this course is so bad too, because the material under consideration is vital to a thorough understanding of CS theory. The material in this course is what separates CS from code monkeys. This is why you're better off not taking this course, and obtaining that knowledge through other sources. ",

The last section of the course covers a few topics about distributed systems: file system; distributed memory; datacenter technologies, which are becoming more popular in the growing cloud computing field. In my opinion, it is a must-take course for students in CS background who need some refreshment for their undergrad OS class. OS knowledge is a core background requirement for almost all CS programs. \n\nFor the projects: there are 4 projects in total and 3 of them are coding projects. The projects are in C and some familiarity of C is required. I already have C background but the challenge is to complete the projects and pass the Udacity online grading. The online grading can be tricky sometimes because the online grader sometimes does not give you sufficient failure information, besides it is usually more rigorous than your local test run on VM. Many times, you need to insert fprint to just debug. That always takes a lot of time. The piazza forum is always very active and helpful. I would not be surprised if someone has to spend 40-50 hours on one particular coding project. The tip is to start early so you can spread the whole work into 2 or 3 weeks instead of trying to finish it during last weekend. My impression from Piazza is that people who do well in the projects tend to start very early and engage the discussion very early. \n\nFor the exams, it is closed book closed notes exam. You need to study the videos and read the materials. It is not very difficult, but you do need to spend some time studying them since there are a lot of concepts and details there. \n\nOverall, it is a very good class.

Some of the material is a little dense, and the lectures can be sometimes circuitous. If you're watching the lectures through the web, you can set the speed to 1. 25x for the youtube player. You might find this helpful if you're having difficulty focusing on the lectures. \n\nI had professional programming experience but only a little bit in C. I found the programming part difficult only as I was becoming acquainted with the problem. After that, the assignments are very straightforward. Projects 1 and 3 are time consuming and will take 20-30 hours of your time. Projects 2 and 4 will only take 3-5 unless you do the extra credit. \n\nJudging by my interactions with other students, if you're going to take this class and are not comfortable programming, you should:\n- Learn how to work inside a VM. Learn how to set up a shared folder between the VM and your host machine in advance if you think you'll need it (you probably don't)\n- Learn enough C. The C programming in this course is not hard, but if you're not comfortable with the language's semantics you'll be overwhelmed on the first assignment. \n- Learn how to work in GCC, GDB, Make and Valgrind. There are plenty of great tutorials out there. \n\nMy only complaint is that the sample exams in Udacity didn't adequately prepare me for the real exams. Other than that, this course is excellent. Professor Ada and the TAs were super responsive. I don't recall ever having to wait more than 20-30 minutes for a response ever. I definitely recommend taking this course. ",

Starner and his work in Sign Language recognition, wearable computing, and Dolphin communication. This course was the initial offering of 6601 for the OMSCS program. The professor and the TAs input an enormous amount of effort to pull off this course - my thanks to them. As a note of context, this course was advertised to be offered in Spring '16 and then cancelled late Fall '15 and then surprisingly re-released at the 11th hour. \n\nAs the course advertises in its description, it is intended for those who have some background in AI or are ready to jump into the deep end (true statement) The description asks for 9 hrs per week and it should be modified to reflect the true effort required in this class. Most students, including myself, input 20+ hours per week to stay afloat. Most of the time you spend will be on solving an assignment and researching. It's very easy to forget that you have to watch the lectures as well! \n\nThe professor's assignment methodology was to introduce a concept through lecture, then complete some 'warm-up' problems in the beginning of each assignment to develop intuition. At the end of the warm-up, you solve more difficult problems by implementing solutions that had not been explicitly covered in class. This was certainly the most rewarding and difficult part of the class!\n\nThere were several first-time hiccups in assignments and exams, however the TAs and the professor had open ears and minds and ultimately made it right and I'm sure that the next offering of this course will be even better. \n\nI learned an incredible amount about the material even though I felt overwhelmed during the majority of the course. This is certainly an opportunity to become familiar with the AI field with an intensive, hands-on experience from which you will benefit greatly. ",

The course stuff repeatedly promised assignment materials by a certain date, and then consistently released them a week+ later and then changed the due date to compensate (and consequently acted like they were doing everybody a favor). \n\nThe lecture material was somewhat interesting, but there was literally only several hours of lectures total. \n\nThis class was an easy A at least.

I ended up with a C, and I think it was just due toward the end of the class where I couldn't focus on it so much because I was spending all my time with my other life sucker of a class. \n\nThe material in this course is dense, rigorous, but it did seem regularized. The professor really wanted to clamp the students down to his style of learning. In a way, I enjoyed the \"isolation\" method that was suppose to bring about ones own ability to solve a problem. I think to some extent it worked. I felt like I was really using my brain, and I felt I was generally sharper in my daily life. These were the homework assignments. They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn't do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems. I really had a time crunch, but like I said, I unknowingly set myself up for it by taking the big data class. \n\nThere could be something fundamental I was not getting, but over all, even if I liked it to some extent, this isolation method didn't seem like the best way to learn. I get it, that a degree in any establishment is given better credit when the students are not spoon fed answers. Yet, I felt like I did not have the proper tools to achieve an A. It's frustrating for sure, I don't know if I should take another semester and switch specializations or just try it again. I am a bit discouraged after it all. I did try to understand the material as I have done with my other classes. \n\nYeah, don't take this with any other high demanding course. Please don't. ",

New for this semester: they returned a first submission of homework with feedback, and we had a resubmission opportunity for 100% of the grade (6 homework assignments - 3 problems each). Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there's a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams. \n\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A's, 10 B's, 6 C's.

Please review your C++. It wasn't too bad but having some background on C++ will help you be ahead in the coding projects. Overall I loved the course, even though it was difficult. ",

            "text": "First off, the GT course surveys site currently reports this as almost as difficult as 6505. This wasn't true, at least for me. This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\n\nHomework:\nThe homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project. \n\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm. This was by no means _hard_, but it was time consuming. \n\nGrading/Administration\nI thought grading was generous. The homeworks were graded fairly, but it would have been nice to have a more explicit rubric. ",

The class also had a month long break after midterms were nothing was due. \n\nThe last two assignments were crazy difficult and people struggled a lot. There was not much help from the instructors and the Piazza forum was ran by only handful of students. The software analysis tool used was the one developed by the professor and it had limited documentation and no practical value unless you are into system programming, IDE development, Compiler design etc. \n\nSoftware Test part of this course is good and has some practical use. Software Analysis is good to know and is explained well but not applicable to everyone. \n\nIf you are just looking to add one course to complete the course requirements, stay away from it.

It was kind of a competition: the teaching staff often posted the top 5 performers among the submitted projects, with metrics and whatnot, so I got to try my very bestest to make it to that list. It was madness! (good madness)\nEach project illustrated a very advanced element of HPC, so I left with a feeling of having learned a lot. \n\nProf. Vuduc has a very particular sense of humor, which he embedded in his videos. It surprised me how I never got fed up with the jokes. I guess I always find a true nerd's humor amusing. \n\nI'd like to invite everyone to give HPC a chance. The fact that it's not required for a specialization (anymore :'S) shouldn't mean it's not worth the effort. This class is the bomb! It's packed with algorithm design and analysis (and very clever algorithms, by the way), several models of computation that you may not have studied before, and probably should, oh and the projects are spectacular. If you like algorithms, programming, getting your mind blown, and are up for a challenge, this class is for you. It's hands-on Computer Science in my opinion. \n\nThere are some requirements that I'll try and emphasize here:\n - Running time and complexity analysis, Big O and Theta notation, the master method, etc. \n - C and C++. You gotta know how to code in these languages. I mean know them well. If you're afraid of pointers, you should get some practice first. \n - Basic Linux command line knowledge, as projects involve a virtual machine and the Deepthought Cluster. \n - Some linear algebra, as in virtually any other class. \n - C and C++. Yes, you need to be able to get an algorithm from a lecture or an academic paper down to functional C/C++ code. \n - Debugging in the woods with your teeth and a knife. \n\nGive it a shot, You'll have fun!",

Very interesting! \n\nNevertheless, I don't really agree with the course creator on the grading breakdown. The four exams accounted for too much of a percentage (15% each), while the final phase of the course project took us 20+hours per week but it accounted for merely 10%.

All of the harder parts in the second half are quite interesting whereas the beginning starts out a little slow and annoying with a lot of Python API introduction that could be done more efficiently (i. e. learn NumPy and Pandas API's on your own). \n\nThe class is worth taking for its own interest and also as an easy intro to Machine Learning. \nBe warned that the time requirements and any half-finished reports saying it is easy are very misleading. \nIt starts out super easy and lulls you into a false sense of ease which will be shattered one or two days after it is too late to drop the class. After the drop date you will suddenly find the time requirements go up by about a factor of 5. The hours per week workload in the beginning it is maybe 5 hours or even less but after the drop date it can easily jump to 20 hours per week or more if you are not a \"pythonista\" or try for bonus points. \n\nProfessor Balch is super engaged on Piazza which is awesome!

Make sure you pay careful attention to assignment requirements and always test on the GA Tech buffet machines or provided VM, especially for execution time restrictions. If you work hard, put in the required time, and ask lots of questions then the assignments aren't too hard and can be aced.

He is very active on piazza and sometimes I wondered whether he slept at all :) Piazza threads are super organized, so if when there were close to 10, 000 posts, you could read what was relevant to you. I have no ML or AI background, given that I found the lectures very informative, some students in the class who had taken ML didn't like the contents much! The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn't use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each. I have given 15 hours/week but I think you can do with 10 hours/week if you are very goal oriented and super focused unlike me. Whatever be your specialization, I think you should take this course to get the most professional OMSCS experience!!",

I've taken a few other classes before and they all had a major disconnect between lectures and assignments -- the lectures were very thin compared to what was expected and a lot of self researching was needed. Dr. Bobick really does care about teaching this subject and wants you to understand and appreciate it fully and this shows easily in his lectures, which are formatted logically and are exhaustive (well, atleast for an intro course.. ). The TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, made good comments when assignments were returned. \n\nRegarding the content of the course, much of your time will be spent on parameter tuning rather than implementing concepts and algorithm (especially in problem set 2, the hardest one IMO). So it is a good idea to play with the parameters early in the course and get an understanding of how they change the results. It does get a bit math intensive towards the middle and latter part of the course so brushing up on your linear algebra would go a long way. The final was open-book and was quite easy and straightforward sticking to higher level questions than mundane specifics. \n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this class to bits and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to dive into this wonderful and nascent field!",

Resist the temptation to save all of the lectures for later. \n\nProjects are done in C. Skeleton code is given, but a lot of thought needs to be put into how your implementation can play nice with the pre-written code. Also, a lot of time is spent wrangling with the autograder; sometimes the autograder doesn't provide any meaningful or consistent output. Projects are judged against several test cases; a difficult point for me was anticipating some of these test cases, but the project rubric and other people's questions and answers on Piazza gave helpful hints on what cases to anticipate. \n\nSpeaking of Piazza, questions are answered quickly, either by students, or the TA/the professor. Office hours are also consistent. \n\nNumber of hours spent: I had to work during lunches (every day during weeks when projects were due or an exam was being held), and an hour or two after work if I'm not already wiped out. Also had to devote several hours on weekends for projects and studying for exams. \n\nOverall, a very solid and straightforward class. There aren't any tricks or gotchas in my opinion, and results will accurately reflect the amount of work you put in. Be prepared to put in a lot of work though. ",

The Udacity lectures are simplistic and useless, although hilarious, since the presenter sounds like Elmer Fudd. The new Prof prioritized making this a weeder course. Valid solutions were not provided for prob sets, reason given was to have students work things out on their own. Side effect was that graded HW feedback could not be argued by students, as there was no ground truth to compare to. Much time was spent trying to \"prove\" things that had little to no practical real world value, (Cantor's diagonal argument). Difficulty defending any proof other than what TA's had in mind, or on answer sheet. Akin to religious argumentation. Prof mentioned struggling with 6505 himself when he took it recently. Seems this was payback time for the next batch of students. \n\nWarning, all online resources were banned. An ultimatum was issued halfway through the course for students to admit to having \"Googled\" to receive 0 on an assignment and have a note added to their permanent record to avoid more severe punishment. It seems several students had OSI investigations launched and received \"I\" incomplete or \"F\" on their transcripts. Imagine having this happen to you for looking something up on Wikipedia. \n\nUpdate: IRP stats are now up. http://www. irp. gatech. edu/reports/grades_by_instructorsmry. php. \nPryby - Spring2016 A:32, B:63, C:64, F:8, I:3, Total:170, (W:132) 44% failed\nBrubaker - Spring2015 A:38, B:15, C:9, D:11, U:1, Total:74, (W:107) 28% failed\nConsidering a C is not a passing grade for many specializations it is pretty severe that 44% of the non withdrawn students do not receive an acceptable grade.

You don't need to have a project in mind before starting the class but since all the activities since week two are directed towards researching your problem space, you'll need to land on one pretty quickly. Alternatively, you can join someone else's project, which I'd probably recommend even if you have your own idea. With more people on the team, you can combine your efforts, build something more polished, and have more fun along the way. Otherwise, despite encouraging feedback from peer reviews, you might feel a little lonely in your one-man-project. \n\nDuring the first 5 weeks, there will be a short (~500 words) written submission documenting your research every week, followed by project proposal. In the next 8 weeks, you'll be working on the project, summarizing your progress in a short text or video recording every other week. In the final two weeks, you will combine all your previous notes and research to write an academic paper in a format and quality to be presented at a scientific conference. You don't have to officially submit it but even without doing so, you'll have gone through the entire process of researching a topic, identifiying a problem, designing a solution, and writing a paper about it. \n\nThe structure of the course is very free-form. There are no common videos or texts to read -- instead, you'll be expected to do your own research (i. e. find relevant papers, learn tools you want to use). There is a suggested breakdown of how much time you should spend on research/review/writing/programming in a given week (~10h/w total), but the actual content varies for each student. The plus side is, you'll be assigned a mentor who will guide you on your journey. And if you've known David Joyner for a while, you can be sure he'll post weekly plan and summary announcements, daily discussion threads, and reply to almost every comment. ",

I tried my best to be fair & hopefully it helps others. I got a B in this class. \n\nContent: Videos are highly analytic & professor often uses “so” & “therefore” to skip explaining a concept. I took this class under the impression that it’s related to the standard testing/QA but it was mostly about compiler design/efficiency. Video lectures quality is overall low especially towards the end. \nPre-requisites: Pre-reqs were removed from the course page later on. You need to be proficient in Java, C, discrete math …\nExams: I’ll summarize it with this epic story: Instructor posted a pdf with sample questions prior to the midterm & based on the comments on Piazza, majority of the class simply thought that he posted the wrong pdf or in the wrong class. Average for the midterm exam was in mid-50. Hopefully you can understand the gap here\nAssignments: They are written in a very dense academic format. Professor & the TAs weren’t helpful in explaining the assignment, providing resources or answering Piazza questions. They run a plagiarism program over all the assignments & you can end up at the dean office or get an F if they find you plagiarized. \nPiazza: Professor & TAs are very detached from Piazza but you see lots of helpful comment from the top 5% of the class. Anon post are not allowed. \nProfessor/TA: In a nutshell I think I’d have enjoyed this class a lot more if we had an active/engaged, professional & experienced professor. The staff was not open to any suggestion or feedback. I felt they were very much used to the on-campus traditional style of teaching & communication with students. Professor Mayur only showed up to say the harsh words or threaten students. Before finals week he sent a mass email saying: “I find that you plagiarized in this assignment while grading, the consequences will be severe: an F grade in this entire course. ”",

I’m working as Software Engineer but I still feel the class is fun and worth taking. It brushed up my git skills and introduced me to Android programming. \n\nThe instructor (Prof. Orso) is very active and always conducts office hours every week, he is also always present in piazza (except nearing the end of the semester, when he and all TAs were overwhelmed with grading and grade challenges). \n\nThe load is quite constant and I spent about 5-7 hours a week, except for the Android team project, which I spent almost 50 hours across 3 weeks span. But that’s more because I wanted to deliver a ‘nice looking UI’ with a close-to-non-existent Android expertise. \n\nThe contents are pretty straightforward and easy to grasp. There is no exam but instead your grade comes mostly from assignments and projects. Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the ‘optional’ office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don’t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.

Some take an insane amount of time to complete, while others are very easy. The overall balance felt about right for the assignments. \n\nUdacity - Some lectures were better than others, but the quizzes in them were excellent. They really helped you learn the material. Very well thought out and the best quizzes out of any class I've taken. \n\nExams - horrendous. Absolutely did not test our knoweldge of the material whatsoever. Questions came out of complete left field and I feel are more ego-driven to show off how smart the professor is and his vast amount of knoweldge outside of Software testing than to actually test us on what we know. I failed the final and got a D on the midterm. But then again, the median grade for each was in the D/F range -- this alone speaks volumes. \n\nTime spent - This is hard to calculate, as some weeks were 40 hours, and then there were stretches of time where there was no work whatsoever. It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments. \n\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones. This was very unprofessional and should have been handled discretely without obnoxiously threatening the entire class. \n\nAll in all. It was a solid class with a good amount of work. Grading was generous, even with the impossible exams. ",

The course is not hard and you can make it fun but it is up to you. \nThe lectures are mere overview of the topics, my undergrad AI course gave me much deeper knowledge on AI. You're on your own discovering the topics; lots of readings are presented so you can dig deeper if you'd like. Which is nice. But I would go as far as don't even waste your time watching lectures if the title sounds familiar to you - for example there is a lecture on classification but it does not go into any mathematical or implementation detail whatsoever. If you've taken an AI, ML or CV class before (or you've read a few pages on wikipedia about statistical classification), you already know more than it is presented in the class. \nWritten assignment are fine, they are short and as the class doesn't, neither are you required to go into technical details. The grading of the papers is a bit of a lottery, depends a lot on the reviewer. I got points taken away for totally contradicting reasons between two assignments. \nThe coding homework is fun but barely has anything to do with the class materials. Turns out you better off implementing stuff on your own (hardcoding lots of stuff) and later claim that this for cycle is 'learning by recording cases' and those if conditionals are 'decision trees' or whatever. \nSo all in all interesting ideas are presented, coding can be fun (but time consuming if you're not good at Python), the papers are not hard and grading is generous but there is no connection between these. Requirements are not always clear and you never really know where you at performance-wise which caused frustration for some. You can easily get a B or A in this class with very small effort - papers can be done in an hour or two, you can skim through videos quickly and the 3 programming assignments can be done during a weekend. Rest of it is up to you. ",

The group project is also nice - if you're on a team which knows what they're doing! I was on a team where one person was essentially MIA for the whole time. This has lead to the higher workload and sleepless nights from my part. I found taking AI and ML less stressful than dealing with the group projects in this course (comparatively when I took intro to health informatics, that group project was relatively pleasant)!\n\nAt the rate this course is going - it looks like it will be my first B of my 7 courses in the program.

            "text": "Reviewing near the end of the course. Great course that focuses on how classic CS concepts like graph theory can be practically applied by tailoring software for embedded systems. \n\nThis class isn't a hardware course, nor is it a course on how to write software for an embedded system. It's a class on how software is manipulated to run efficiently on power, hardware, and size limited devices. \n\nIt covers:\nembedded system instruction set architectures\nhardware support \ninstruction level parallelism\npipelining\nand compiler optimizations that take regular code and compile it such that it can run on embedded systems. \n\nThe course was condensed for summer but I think we still covered the same material. We had 4 homework assignments (initially 5), each taking about 5-15 hours to complete over 2 weeks. There was one project, taking about 20-25 hours to complete over a moth. There were also homework assignments due during this time. I think the full semester may have two projects, and two more homeworks that were smaller. \n\nThere was a proctored midterm and will be a proctored final, the midterm took an hour to complete (you get two hours). The level of difficulty was on par with the homework, but the test is closed notes. \n\nIn the condensed semester there were 2 lectures series and a reading per week for the first half, dropping to one of each after the midterm. The hardest thing to keep up with is covering the material in order to do the homeworks and take the tests, I recommend watching at 1. 25 speed due to reduce time spent. \n\nThe project and one homework were C++ programs. You can do this in your own environment, but you will run some code on GT's deepthought cluster via SSH. There's no GUI, but all you need are basic Linux commands. The assignments were straightforward implementations of concepts from the lectures/readings. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this course. If you are taking CCA, this course will apply some of the Graph theory concepts covered there. ",

I really can't complain about them. \n\nThe projects are really only a challenge whenever the questions are ambiguous, nonsense, or rewritten by the TAs after release (formally or informally on Piazza via \"clarifications\"). \n\nTAs are not very responsive on the forums, from what I've seen. \n\nThis course does not meet my expectations for this program.

However, the programming projects were a bit more difficult and extremely time consuming, thus the reason for my higher average workload feedback. Mark Moss was a very good professor. He attended all office hours together with the TA's. TA's were also very responsive on Piazza as well, so support was easy to get if you asked for it. Projects were all java based which was nice because my Java background is lacking, so I was able to learn a new programming language as a result. In terms of project details, the first project was not team based and required decent knowledge of optimization concepts and the use of the Gurobi optimization framework. So you would be wise to brush up on Linear Programming optimization. Projects 2 & 3 were team based and as someone else mentioned on a different review, if you have a strong team, you will love this course! We had a diverse set of skills that allowed us to get very good grades on the projects, in addition to coming up with really cool designs and implementations. For our last project, we pretty much designed a full web based distributed application that utilized Vaadin (web gui), Spring (MVC framework), and the Gurobi optimizer. These are all technologies that I believe are used in the real world so I believe I can really apply what I have learned. ",

Most of the assignments are related to compiler optimization and scheduling. The video course material is riddled with errors and inconsistencies, explanations of topics are pretty weak and assignments come in verbose long paragraphs of text walls which also have some errors in them. So to do any assignments the best thing is to wait it out on Piazza and have all the questions answered before you begin to solve one. The best way i found to go about this course is to ONLY read the text book and do one of the many other compiler lectures (from CMU online) to understand the text. They should really throw away all the material they have created and make a new one. Honestly, this is one course you can absolutely do without (or you can audit in your spare time if you wish) not because of the course content but the haphazard way of delivering content mired with errors. \n\nThe grading is lenient so at least that is a positive and once you cut through the clutter, the course material is moderate difficulty.

Other diagrams get supporting roles. \n\n2) the taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\n\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n1) grades focus on the _syntax_ of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming. \n\n2) in summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments. \n\n3) also in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback. \n\n4) another summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.

They ranged from straightforward to tedious due to the wide range of skills needed. For example, the first assignment favored those who had a C-background while the last assignment favored those who were savvy with JavaScript. I would recommend doing a 'bonus' project, preferably one which is geared towards your own skill set. \n\nLectures were split between Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee. Those given by Ahamad will literally put you to sleep. Lee keep a more brisk pace. I am not big into reading text books at all, but willed myself into reading this time due to many of the quiz (and therefore midterm and final) questions being pull from there. The quizzes are open book/notes and answers can easily be found online, but it is recommended to first attempt them without assistance since the midterm and final are closed book/notes. \n\nThe main reason that I took and would recommend this class is if you are going for the Computing Systems concentration.

As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons. \n\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort. \n\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can't get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn't had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\n\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\n\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don't just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts. You will get more out of the class. \n\nFinal note: To the anyone that suggests Googling for quiz answers: are you sure you want to be in the program? If you just want a piece of paper, I there are some other lovely online degrees you can pursue. ",

I do think the ratings on this class at the time I took it are very deceiving. Perhaps others didn't need the time I took but the projects both required quite a bit of time. I am an accomplished programmer, and that helped, but I should've taken a linear algebra refresher before this class. Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning. ",

The mathematics are not very advanced or sophisticated (trig, probability, and some calc), but they can be a stumbling block in the projects. This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester. \n\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later. \n\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort. \n\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.

This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 …. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment. ",

On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (trust me, I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher myself in a European university before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background of students.

Execute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you're up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory. \n2. Malware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought. \n3. Cryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment. \n4. Web security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code. \n\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets.

The projects were interesting, but not as open-ended or as tough as ML. Make sure that you have some ability to create a video (e. g. slides and voice-over) and don't leave it for the last day. ",

            "text": "I'll start with the good:\n\n1) The class has some fascinating topics. You'll learn the basics of how to do things like buffer overflows, malware analysis, encryption (cracking), and exploiting vulnerable websites. \n\n2)Some of the TAs were particularly good to work with. I'm looking at you Matt and Peter. \n\n3) Some of the projects were really fun. Project #1 (overflows) and Project #4 (web vulnerabilities). \n\n4) You get the opportunity for extra credit via an optional project that expands on one of the \"official\" projects. \n\nNow unfortunately the things I didn't like:\n\n1) I can't say this strongly enough, \"logistics\". I get this is a summer course so everything is condensed, but there were problems across the board regarding issues with projects and issues with autograders. The \"optional\" project grading policy was changed no less than 3 times within a week of the end of the semester. \n\n2) Get ready for some quizzes with \"subjective\" or \"ambiguous\" true/false questions. Good luck arguing them. They'll say not to read into them too much; but then come back at your challenge with some convoluted worded reasoning why you're wrong. \n\n3) The book is absolutely tedious to read. The authors need to understand the concept of \"run on\" sentences. \n\n4) Grades on practically EVERYTHING were held up because someone was suspected of cheating. \n\n5) Some of the projects seemed like straight busy work (cough Project #2). \n\n6) Some of the projects seemed like they added extraneous stuff just to make our life harder (cough Project #3). \n\n7) They'll crackdown on cheating, but let students ask questions on Piazza that practically go through step by step what to do. Seriously. Wait till a day or two before the projects are due and just read through Piazza and you won't need to do any work. This has got to be the biggest \"nope\" for me. I think it demeans the value of the program when people no longer have to try or even research on their own. ",

Content was completing problems on Udacity (24%) in Weeks 1 to 6, runaway robot (36%) and the final project of predicting the future location of a small robot (hexbug) (40%). I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest. \n\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project. \n\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A). \n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda! \n\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work. \n\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution. ",

Provides a decent overview of computer security concepts, but doesn't dive into most of them very deeply. \n\nLectures:\nSome of the lectures are quite long. Most of them repeated or rephrased what was in the book. Not the best lectures I've had so far, but not terrible either. \n\nHomework:\nThere's a quiz portion to your grade. The quizzes are open everything and were taken verbatim from phrases in the textbook. To make the best use of them, it's best to read, watch lectures, and then attempt the quiz with everything put away. Afterwards, you can check your answers and submit. \n\nThe projects in this class were probably the best part. There are four projects that each focus on some aspect of computer security. Most required writing some code, while one consisted of analyzing malware. Each one took me 4 to 5 hours to complete, so not terribly hard. The project that dealt with finding vulnerabilities in a web application was the most fun. There were also some optional projects which could be used to bump up a low test or project grade. \n\nTests\nTests were multiple choice and proctored. They didn't take too long to complete, and if you actually were doing the reading, they were fairly straightforward. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThe TAs were fairly active on Piazza. Grading seemed fair to me, with most projects auto graded. There were a few projects that had hiccups, but the TAs seemed to fix them within a few days. \n\nAdditionally, it was nice that the class offered optional projects. \n\nBook:\nThe textbook for this class was interesting at its best, and extremely dry at its worst. You _might_ be able to get by without the textbook here, but it was extremely useful in studying for tests and quizzes. \n\nConclusion:\nWorth taking if you're looking for a summer class and don't have broad knowledge of information security concepts.

There are weekly assigned lectures and readings (papers provided by the instructor). \n\nOn Summer, an assignment was due every week, I'd say their goal was assessing that the students understood concepts explained on the lectures. You do not submit code, only results, so you could solve them with Java, Python, Excel, pencil and paper. There's an auto grader available! Some assignments were more interesting than others. \n\nIn Summer we only had one final exam (25 true/false questions, and you had to explain your answer). It was hard to cram all that information in one week (assuming you started to study once you submitted the final project). It seems that in full semesters, a midterm was also part of the evaluation, that would have made the load more manageable. \n\nFor both projects assigned (midterm and final project) we had to replicate the results of published RL papers. We had to explain about our implementation, the assumptions we made, the difficulties we had, etc. You can use any language/library since code was not submitted, only the report and a 3-minute video presentation. You learn a LOT doing that. Start working as soon as you can in the projects! \n\nAt the end, the grading was generous, since people who were on the C (70-80%) or B (80-90%) brackets, ended up earning the upper grade (B, A, respectively)\n\nI highly recommend this course if you are interested on the topic. You can go as deep as you want in the material. The resources shared by the instructor are gold, and will give you many ideas for future work or research. ",

The lectures are informative and thought-provoking, but there's not a whole lot of depth.

TAs were incredibly helpful on Piazza with quick replies and knowledgeable (Tony Mason completely rocked it). \n\nThe only complaint I would have is that the Udacity autograder was configured to execute code that was different from what we were provided to test in local VMs, so several times I found myself ripping my hair out trying to figure out why some client-server test was timing out on Udacity after 10s but completing in milliseconds on my local VM. It seems the TAs love to set up network partition errors for client-server tests. You know who you are... ;)\n\nOverall great course, got more in-depth OS knowledge than I came into it with, and feel like it was one of the best-organized courses I've taken so far (3rd in the program).

The project is an app to support transaction processing and report generation, with the first phases consisting of logical modeling, turning in a few diagrams and reports, involving maybe a few hours of work on each person's part. \n\nThen you implement it. It's not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can't take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn't break anything so the gotchas in your demo don't return bad query results. \n\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren't available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project. That project, which takes up more time than the rest of the course combined, is worth 10% of the grade, and the exams are all multiple choice with 0 partial credit, so you get the final asking you exactly how many bytes are required to implement a specific kind of dense index and if you're off by 20, 0 points. 25 questions, so 3 wrong and you no longer have an A. There's no curve, so you can see for yourself that somehow one of the easiest courses in the program ends up with one of the lowest grade distributions. All because of highly weighted exams that were regularly regraded because the answer keys were wrong or in some cases the questions didn't even have clear right answers at all. ",

You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk. \n\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can't prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both. \n\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you'll get in this program. The projects, reproducing published research, give you the valuable real-world experience of just hacking away and making educated guesses until success magically happens. Then you have to figure out how it happened and be able to explain it. \n\nThe con is the weekly homeworks are too easy, simple algebra problems that might take a few lines of code but sometimes you can just do in your head, none of which take more than a couple minutes, basically free points. That time could be devoted to more projects. Function approximation (deep RL) especially is critical and hot and in the headlines and we barely covered it. ",

On the other hand you may experience extreme anxiety, delusions, dissociation, lack of sleep, and paranoia.

For a graduate program you should also be prepared to write proofs and reason mathematically about the algorithms. \n\nTo stretch the analogy, going into CCA high on anxiety and fear will not help you out. Be prepared but not afraid. To prepare: watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation series on YouTube while you read along with your copy of Sipser for the Computability part of the course. Watch the first 3 lectures from MIT OCW Math for Computer Science to warm you up on proofs. Start going through chapters of CLRS that match the complexity and algorithms part of the course. In particular pay attention to graph algorithms, dynamic programming and linear programming as they are a big part of the final algorithms section. Practice all the reductions you can for the complexity section. The format may change semester to semester, but here's a hint: if they give you practice problems - practice them - all of them - because the practice problems may show up on the exams. ;)\n\nLastly, don't delay the course. Maybe not make it your 1st course, but making it the last is not advised since that will just add to the stress of taking it. The best way to prepare for CCA is to take CCA. Good luck. ",

This is partly a factor of the reduced term period, but also because I also spent a lot of extra hours on Above & Beyond work for the homeworks just because I got obsessed and was having fun. If you restrain your enthusiasm then you will reduce your workload by a large amount. On the other hand I think putting in the extra time will help you get more out of it because the base parts of all the homework assignments are pretty easy and simple. \n\nWhile the material and base assignments were pretty simple, this summer the assignments were being reworked for autograding which meant they were not released in advance, so it made dealing with summer travel more difficult as we had about 2 assignments due each week for the first two months of the course. The pace was sustainable but a little tiring due to my travel plans and not being able to work ahead. Be aware of that even though the course is ranked easy (in future semester perhaps this won't be a problem). \n\nI had taken CV prior to this course, so in several areas the CP material was simpler and a less in-depth treatment of the material. However in the 6th and 7th lecture modules of the course they cover more specialized topics that were interesting and for the \"8th\" module we were given a collection of 6 academic papers to read.

            "text": "This courses has been the most disappointing course for me in OMSCS so far. I will admit that I have no prior experience in robotics and I felt that I will learn the concept along the way. The lectures were frustrating , skim in details and glossed over necessary mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. I spent many hours over them but was still not able to understand the maths. The TAs though active did not do anything to help you understand these concepts. The office hours with Dr Thrun were of no help either. \n I just felt that they are deliberately trying to hand over B’s and C’s to students. You can confirm that from grade distribution for Spring 2016 where only 48% people got an A as opposed to 80% in earlier semesters. I have no problem with getting a lower grade as long as the subject simulates my thinking and helps me understand the concept. I wasn’t able to grasp any concept taught in the class , as the projects did not require any application of the concepts. This course might have been tolerable in the past when 80 - 90% people got an A when the instructors understand that the material provided in this course is too superficial and graded accordingly. But instead of improving the quality of the course , they decided to add vigor by making testing harness hard and by ensuring that 50% people should get B or lower. If you miss one single test case , you will lose 10 - 12 points and then there is no coming back. (Hint : Please confirm for runway robot1 , which values can be negative. It will be obscurely defined and if you miss it you will be done. ) \n If you get lower marks in project 1 , promptly withdraw from this course. (No please don’t fall for we will consider hardware and software challenges if you are in between grades. There were 5 software challenges and 4 hardware challenges and if you do them all , they will account for 1 mark. ). Stay away or learn all maths before hand. ",

It was a bit more work than average this semester since it was the first time this class had been offered for the summer. Since the semester is shorter, there is a bit more work to be done per week. Very doable. Since this was the first summer semester for this course, the TAs and Professor did their best to try and make it better for the students. Although, sometimes the decisions seemed to be knee-jerk and ended up making things harder rather than easier. ",

I learned a lot about the mechanisms and abstractions that go on under the hood in an operating system (specifically Linux) as well as how to put them to use in building applications. For me this was a perfect class for the earlier part of my degree program (2nd class). \n\nThat being said, this learning came at a fairly high cost to me. Going into the class I considered myself a 'novice' in C and 'intermediate' in a couple other languages (I didn't graduate as CS undergrad). The first project is estimated to take ~30 hours, and it took me 70 hours. The next two took me ~45 and ~25, respectively. I'd say if you are already proficient in programming in C or have the time to make yourself proficient, this class is definitely worth the effort. \n\nAlso, Prof Ada, the TAs, and my classmates were all very active and very helpful on Piazza. Prof Ada held office hours every week via Hangouts On Air, so they could be reviewed on YouTube at your convenience. Very engaged staff that really want to see you succeed, regardless of your familiarity with C / Linux stuff.",

The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun's relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn't seem like as much of a road block. \n\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun's lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable. \n\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer. By the time the projects start (if you don't front-load) you feel like you are constantly playing catch-up. This only adds to the stress you feel because the projects don't really line up with any of the lectures. ",

I took it over the summer and was disappointed that Dr. Isbell was not very interactive in the class... the TAs ran the show daily/weekly. They were extremely helpful and responsive (above average). As always, start everything early. There were two projects and a single (final) exam over the summer, but I understand the 'regular' semesters have had a 3rd project and an extra exam. New developments for the summer: The class was language agnostic and you didn't have to submit code... just auto-graded for the weekly assignments. No code submission for the projects... just a report and video presentation. Some of my grades on the projects and exam were definitely not that great, but overall grading was fair given the class changes and compressed summer schedule. I'd say it's a must-take if you're interested in RL. There's a ton of reading, though, and the lectures are fairly dense... not a class you can run the videos on 2x the first time through!",

I had prior backgrounds on some of the topics covered, and this class helped me to assemble the bits and pieces together. \n\nLectures: they cover really broad range of topics, from buffer overflow (low level application security) to web security. Each topic is not discussed in great details, but given that this course is an introductory course, this is quite expected. \n\nQuizzes: Most of the questions are taken straight from the book. If you watch the lectures and read the book, it is very easy to get 100% for the quizzes. \n\nProjects: The projects are fun, and help to understand and appreciate the topics better. Sometimes it takes a while to get what each project is about, but once you get a hang of it, the project can be done in a reasonable amount of time. (I spent about 7 - 10 hours per project) Furthermore the classmates are very helpful with the projects, even to the extent of almost giving away some of the answers. Most of the projects are auto-graded, so the answers are only either correct or wrong and no room for subjectivity. There were some hiccups with the auto-grading but the TAs quickly rectified them. \n\nExams: Similar level of difficulty with quizzes, not that challenging but good understanding of the concepts is needed to provide correct answers. \n\nOptional projects: Intended to be a grade boost, but it seems everybody did quite well so that the final grade curve was also boosted. Students are allowed to submit multiple optional projects but only one will go into the final grade. \n\nOverall it is a fun class, worth taking if you have little or no background in computer security. The workload is quite reasonable, and definitely will be lighter on normal spring / fall semesters. ",

If you have not taken CV, fiddling with a DSLR for the first time and want to get an A [in other words, if you are like me], this course is moderately tough. All assignments except panorama and HDR require very simple python programming. If you are new to numpy, just brush up on some basic numpy tutorials. There are 11 assignments, 1 final project and 1 final exam. 9/11 assignments and the final project have 10 points for above and beyond and the course has absolute grading [no curves]. So, if you want an A then you should have 90+ in all assignments, final project and the exam. Modules 6, 7 and additional reading in module 8 cover very cool, useful and advanced topics and watching/reading them early will give good ideas for the final project. Also, please take notes while watching the lectures because without the notes, it is very difficult to get high marks in the final exam. ",

The assignments have been retooled somewhat to include more complexity, providing more of a challenge. In addition, at least for this summer term, we were presented with the full workload from an academic term in the compressed summer timeframe, meaning most of the 11 assignments were given two at a time (and not in advance. ) In some cases, changes were still being made to assignments days before they were due. \n\nThe course material itself is fascinating; I really enjoyed everything we learned about, and in retrospect would have preferred taking this course in a full term to really be able to dig into the material, instead of just finishing up assignment after assignment. The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion. \n\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students. The confusion, stupid fast workload and angst all made what should have been an enjoyable survey course one of my least favorite in the program as far as organizational issues went. That said, I greatly value everything I learned in that class, and will take a risk on taking CV with the same instructor -- during a regular term! -- solely because of what I learned there.",

The project is interesting and has great flexibilities to try out many different things. If you decided to implement a few killer solutions, it's also easy to get by and get good grades.

He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down. The videos were also weak in a number of areas where complicated concepts were glossed over and never really explained in great detail leaving the TAs to have to try and explain these concepts. The class also seemed to have copied in large part the material from a Stanford course CS295. Some of the assignments for example were taken word for word from the Stanford assignments. Luckily some of the videos from Stanford explain the material way better. I find this really disgusting considering we are always asked not to plagiarize. \n\nOverall the material was not what I was expecting. A number of assignments used libraries with little or no documentation that was often times inaccurate or was utilizing libraries on projects that had been abandoned years before. I really think this class could be better described as to what it is covering and better if some of the more useless aspects were removed.

I struggled not because the material was difficult but because assignments were never entirely clear or the lectures didn't adequately prepare for assignments so you're left researching stack overflow and other places for hours. The projects depending on Android development was a blast! It was cool to see Orso start us off on a mobile project and then implement some of the SDP concepts on the project. Also, you're gonna need a good team for the project. By good I'm not talking about dev-savvy (though it helps). Good in this context means good communicators and overall team members. I had a fantastic team where we could depending on each other and split work appropriately. At the end of the day though, I have a tad bit of a bitter taste in my mouth because of a few assignments and some grading that I didn't agree with 100% (and I'm not the complaining type for this stuff).

The instructor is very active on Piazza (not really sure if it's just because this is the first time offering). Office hours are bi-weekly held. Video lectures have been great so far, although there are only 6 hours of video for all the semester (with a lot of in-line quizzes, maybe that increases the amount of time dedicated to the lectures)\n\nThe course is completely R based, but don't be afraid, you learn it from scratch. I'd say this is a good course to pair with another one, it has a medium load. Also I think this would be a very nice introduction to ML topics. Basic calculus/probability concepts are needed for the second part of the course. \n\nHomework and projects feature open ended questions, where you explain/justify your answers (report) and also provide the R code you wrote to justify your analysis (tables, plots, etc). It's also helpful if you already have experience writing \"vectorized code\" (like in Matlab, Python with Numpy/Pandas, etc). \n\nSyllabus:\n\n- R programming (most of the course will be in R)\n- data visualization\n- data processing\n- logistic regression\n- linear regression\n- high dimensions and regularization\n \nEach one of those \"chapters\" is covered in two weeks, so typically in that lapse of time you watch the lectures and work on the homework/project associated with that chapter. \n\nGrading: \nThe course features three assignments, an individual project (divided in a midterm project, and final project), and a final (open book, not multiple choice) exam with the grade distributed equally between these components (33% all hw, 33% project, 33% exam). \"",

The fact that the course worked this way made me assume that they would eventually curve the grades and were doing this to force us to work super hard, but I was wrong. No curving. Grading is basically not on what you have learned or synthesized, but instead is based on perfection. On one of the early homework assignments I got a 4 out 16 because I wasn't understanding things. It took me 30-40 hours (sometimes as many as 50) hours per week for the rest of the semester to pull my grade up to a B by the end. In the end, I actually had a C but on the final I had answered a question correctly, but not the way he wanted me to and eventually he allowed that I had not only answered it correctly but has proved my answer and so he gave me full credit (I couldn't argue for partial credit) for the question and I got to a B. \n\nThe lectures need to be redone and I think they really need to think about how they have structured the course.",

As I write this review, we're only 10 weeks in the course. \n\nI have a BS in CS, and this makes me familiar with some topics in HCI, such as Usability. I'd say it is an intro to the broad field of HCI. There is no prerequisite for CS 6750, and you'll be perfectly fine with a different background. \n\nThe workload is very light at 15 h/w, more or less. There is one written assignment each week, which consists of four questions, and each should be answered with up to 300 words. Answering the questions requires watching weekly lectures, and reflecting on their objectives. These assignments are publicly available at: http://omscs6750. gatech. edu/fall-2016/full-course-calendar/\n\nCS6750 is very different from code-intensive courses that have coding assignment (e. g. CS 6300 SDP). In HCI, you will describe and analyze user interfaces. I think everyone that designs computerized products should take this course. It gives you a different perspective to look at your tasks, and the interface you use to achieve your goals. \n\nThe Video Lectures are not publicly available, but you can view the Scripts at: https://drive. google. com/drive/folders/0B1-VjNQe61hsYi1YanNYYzdkd3c\n\nIn addition to weekly assignments, there are two exams that should be taken via Proctortrack. These exams are open-note; which means you may watch the lectures as you answer the exams, or review your notes. \n\nFacts:\nNo required textbook or readings. \nNo coding assignments. \nGrades are not curved ( B >= 80, A >= 90 ). \nInstructor is very active in Piazza. \n\nHCI should be perfect for Summer. It can also be combined with another course with Low-to-Medium workload.",

You write code to exploit a fictitious website and also write a Chrome plugin to guard against certain exploits. I found this assignment quite fun. \n\nThe second assignment involves running malware on a VM and examining how it behaves. The entire assignment can probably be done in a single (multi-hour) session. It was quite easy and somewhat interesting. \n\nThe third assignment involves writing IPS/IDS rules using snort to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. This asignment was the most difficult for me and it seemed to cause issues for others as well. Writing snort rules was not particularly hard, but the way the assignment was presented was pretty vague. After prodding the TA we were given some, but not enough in my opinion, additional information. In particular, we were asked to write rules \"with a long shelf life\". There was some comedy here when some of the \"benign\" traffic that was sampled included browsing an adult e-commerce store. Somebody complained and they issued alternate traffic to analyze for those who were offended. \n\nThe last assignment was somewhere between the first and second in terms of effort and required using an ML toolkit to analyze network traffic. Most of the code was provide to us, but it does take some time to figure out how things are setup. The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing an algorithm that was laid out in an academic paper. \n\nThis class is a decent option to fill a Computing Systems concentration requirement.",

However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed.

For me, it was a great refresher in both OS concepts and C programming. The class does take quite a bit of time; the lectures are long and the projects are involved. \n\nThe curve on this class (at least when I took it) was quite generous. For those who are concerned about the amount of time the class consumes, those times are mostly based on students satisfying all project requirements, studying to do well on the exams, and completing the extra credit. If the curve is consistent from semester to semester, you can probably cut quite a few corners and still get an 'A'; if you are only shooting for a 'B' you can do even less (do so at your own risk!). \n\nNote: The structure of this class is learn about an abstract OS concept and then develop an application that uses that linux implementation of that OS concept. For example: learn about threading -> implement a program that uses linux pthreads. This is not a class where you have to implement the OS construct (I think that is reserved for AOS).",

I work at a large company in a division that develops software, and learned much about what certain processes are, why we do things a particular way, alternatives that could be explored and areas that could be improved. The actual coding of the class project was beyond my technical capabilities without a lot of additional work, but fortunately some of my teammates were well versed in programming Java and Android, and I was able to pick up more/most of the work on the requirements and documentation side to make up for it, which obviously helped and felt like a fair distribution. You will need some basic Java programming on your own as well, but if you have any kind of a programming background and take any beginners-level course, like the one offered by Udacity, you'll be fine. The instructors is fantastic and funny, and the TA's are very helpful and responsive. We went nuts with Piazza, which made it hard to keep up with, but that was our fault. Overall I highly recommend this class, even though it's not a killer I think everyone who doesn't have a highly detailed background in large-scale software development and management can benefit from it.",

With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions.",

The material was mostly review for me, although it had been a while since I used relational algebra and I had not have any formal training on functional dependencies before. \n\nWhile the material was pretty easy, the workload was not as light for me as it was for others. Every week or other week there was a project due or an exam to study for. The book is of limited value, but I recommend getting a copy to lookup some of the more obscure questions during tests. The 4th test was by far the hardest for me, so just because you demo'd your project to the TAs does not mean that you are out of the woods. \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, some students had ProctorTrack issues with exam 3 and the TAs ended up dropping the lowest of our first 3 test grades to compensate. It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced. \n\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double). \n\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian. \n\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch.",

The second part was that it was really hard to get a feel if your lab results were expected. It is structured so that you do the work and analyze the results. I ended up analyzing the \"wrong\" results and got double penalized (see point one). The TAs try to help with this, but they can't just come out and say whats wrong, so make sure that you read everyones notes to the TAs regarding the labs.

Kalman and particle filters are covered in AI4R, graph cut and probabilistic algorithms in CCA, and supervised and unsupervised learning from ML.

I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite.",

The lead TA for the class, deliberately or not, has a habit of talking down to everyone. For a graduate level course, it's really uncalled for and, outside of a kindergarten classroom, not conducive to learning. \n\nAssignments were a mess, with deadlines sometimes jumping, but always being very short (sometimes in the course of less than 4 days). If you are expecting a class where you can get caught up on weekends, this is not the course to take. It also didn't help for early assignments that the FHIR server used for the class would get overloaded, especially on weekends, preventing students from getting work done. \n\nTack on to that \"engagement\" exercises that were really more like busy work. If you like taking HR engagement surveys, there will be quite a few of them in this course. You also need to provide weekly status updates (which aren't too bad). These aren't as much of a hassle once you've gotten through all the lectures, but it's a pain to juggle early on in the course. \n\nI'm not surprised this course is not being offered in the near future - logistically it is a nightmare, and with the new presidential administration, healthcare in the US will be changing.

The problems were mainly with pacing of the course and specifics with the project details. There were many dead spots throughout the semester and the projects had evolving instructions / descriptions. I expect these issues to be worked out in subsequent semesters. For those who have taken InfoSec, This course is VERY similar. \n\nLots of opportunities for extra credit, some of the projects are reminiscent of Info Sec as well. The class was project based, with each of 4 projects worth 25% of the grade. Up to 10% extra credit was available through an additional project or PT exam. Overall fairly easy to score very well provided you don't biff more than one project. \n\nProjects focused on web security (similar to InfoSec, JavaScript), network based malware analysis (also similar to InfoSec), Network Monitoring (used Snort and Wireshark) and using ML techniques for anomalous traffic detection (no previous ML experience required, Python). \n\nThe slack study group and other students were particularly helpful on Piazza, and the Teaching staff did what they could to help students and generally were responsive and helpful. As is becoming the norm, the Professor was less present as Prof. Lee now has multiple classes running here in OMS as well as the terrestrial requirements at GT. This did not present a problem. \n\nThere is no required textbook, but taking InfoSec first is listed as a pseudo requirement. While it will make your life here very very easy to take Info Sec first, you can probably get through it without doing that if you have a CS background and have ever dealt with security in a job. \n\nOverall I would recommend taking the class. Well done, and plays well with other classes (in its current incarnation).",

Only a few hours of work a week. \n\nLike others mentioned there are only 4 projects that make up your grade. They are not too difficult and do not take up much time. The first is doing a frame busting exploit and creating a Chrome extension/exploit with Javascript. I have never used Javascript before and found it easy to Google what I needed. Youtube videos helped with creating the Chrome extension. \n\nThe second project involved doing malware analysis using some command line tools and Wireshark while running malware in a VM. If you have not used Wireshark you can find some how to Youtube videos to show you how to find data in packets. \n\nThe third was doing some more packet analysis with Wireshark and writing firewall rules using IP Tables. This project along with the first two took less than 10 hours each. \n\nThe fourth was implementing an exploit in an IDS by modifying some Python code. This one took me the longest to do of the four (about 15 hours total) but ended up only being less than 20 lines of Python. Most of it was trying to make sense of what the exploit was doing from reading a couple white papers and figuring out how to code it. \n\nWe had the option to either take an optional final exam or complete and extra assignment for 10% extra credit! You could choose 1 of 3 projects. I chose one that was an extension of the second official project in the class and only took me an hour and about 4 lines of Python code. Another one that looked interesting involved doing a port scan of the entire IPv4 address space for vulnerabilities. \n\nIf you liked the IT Security class you will like this one. The professor and TA’s were very helpful. It is very similar in workload and content and very easy. I haven’t got my final grade but I would guess ending up near 105% with the extra credit.",

It has some issues, but fortunately they are ones I think will be resolved in future iterations of the course. \n\nThe course stands alone very well, and covers the necessary background material needed to be successful without needing to take other classes. If you have taken CN, InfoSec, and NetSec, you will find much of the material to be review. What is unique to this class is how this pertains to the realm of cyber physical systems like Programmable Logic Controllers, and how these devices are used in a conventional industrial plant. \n\nThis semester the course had 3 projects, each taking between 5-8 hours to complete. Each focused on it's own area - Ladder Logic Programming, Industrial Protocols, and exploiting vulnerabilities in CPS. There was a one hour midterm consisting of multiple choice and T/F style problems. I have yet to take the final, but it is 3 hours long, has a similar format and length to the midterm, and is comprehensive. We are permitted to use a single sheet of notes for the tests. \n\nThe material spends a lot of time focusing on definitions of terms, policies, and best practices. It uses common terminology, so much of it will be familiar, just applied to a new realm. The videos are high quality, easy to understand, and you can tell Professor Beyah was well rehearsed and polished for their production. There are a few moments where I felt like I was watching the Turbo Encabulator video, but it wasn't too terribly distracting. \n\nThe course also has some pacing issues. With only three short projects, straightforward material, two tests, and ~50 students this semester we probably won't get higher than 300 threads in Piazza. I think the inclusion of meatier projects / more projects is likely to occur, and would benefit the class. \n\nIf you are looking to prepare for the course, you could learn Wireshark if you don't already know how to use it, and potentially buy the books in advance and do some casual reading.",

I took a Software Design course during my undergrad and as expected this went more in depth than my undergrad but not as much as one would think. The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester. \n\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester: \n\n1. Feedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza. \n\n2. Grading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class. \n\n3. I found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design.",

The grading is a little wonky, because only your best 5 assignments count, and your final grade is based only on your overall standing at the end of the class. Anything over the overall course mean was an A, and the B cutoff was generously below the mean. \n\nThe lectures are a patchwork of old content from Thrun and Norvig and some new modules with Starner; production value is good, but the new content is often superficial, and it seems to be read from a script. (I'm not saying I could do better, but there are better lectures in the OMS program at this point). \n\nContrary to other posters, I found this class to be a constant frustration. The projects were error-laden, and the staff participation on Piazza was below-average; however, office hours and instructor participation in the class were much better than other classes. The projects were not particularly difficult (similar to RL or CV), but there was not a single graded exercise this semester (assignment or exam) that didn't contain obvious mistakes/errors. Sometimes the staff would acknowledge the issue and make a correction, and other times... not. \n\nIt was not beneficial to start the project early (because of the errors), but it also didn't always pay to start them too late because they would often make changes to the assignments after they were officially released. The autograder (i. e., \"Bonnie\") used to grade assignments would get overloaded the weekend that assignments were due and cause all kinds of reliability problems. I think the Bonnie servers are Udacity infrastructure shared by all GT classes that use the system, so large classes (6601 started with 400+ this term) and overlapping deadlines cause issues. \n\nGive it another couple semesters to work out the bugs before taking this one.",

I found the projects to be pretty entertaining, and they definitely helped me hone my basic image manipulation and Python skills, but the knowledge required to solve the problems was almost completely independent of anything learned in the lectures. That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired.

            "text": "For those who use these reviews to pick an \"easy\" course, please note that this course changes significantly from semester to semester, using student feedback, so only use recent reviews. \n\nIn the Fall 2016, we had 8 projects and 3 proctored exams. There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack). \n\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn't include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material. But it is all doable and largely enjoyable. Definitely recommend.",

If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this class. As for me, I was a little disappointed that the class didn't cover the design and implementation of RDBMS themselves, only the USE of database management systems to implement databases. IE. we didn't learn anything about how MySQL itself is implemented, but instead we learned a process and theory of how to model data using MySQL, if that makes sense. \n\nI will say, Dr. Mark is a very good instructor. The class videos were great, and the TAs were attentive and helpful. I wish Dr. Mark would offer an algorithms class, I'd love to take that :)\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI see some people said the tests were easy, I felt the tests in this class were brutal. The questions were *very* nitty gritty and subtle, and the multiple choice was usually given so that at least two of the answers were very close to the right answer. I studied at length and still averaged a B on the tests. The project was also a lot of work. I had a good team, which helped, but the grading seemed a little arbitrary. Coordinating with other team members required a lot of time and effort, just to keep track of who was doing what, etc. \n\nSome context, because I imagine a lot of you guys will be in the same situation. I think if you had a traditional CS background and had already taken an undergrad DB class, this would probably not be much new, and that would make it a lot easier. However, I am a self-taught programmer with no undergrad background, so there were a lot of little things about the relational algebra, calculus, etc, that I'd never seen before. This class was a good way to pick up a lot of that \"light math\" stuff, since the practical examples given in the class made it a little easier to absorb.",

Most assignments and exams had multiple corrections made to them AFTER they were assigned, causing frustration as you are trying to work on something that is constantly being altered. Lectures are inconsistent in quality/polish as well as how much material they cover and how well. Some lectures seem to be re-used Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun videos that are nearly unwatchable and not remotely on par with other OMSCS classes. \n\nThere are definitely some bright spots in the course and I could see this being a strong offering later on if they refine/replace a lot of the older and poorly quality controlled content. Assignments were relevant to the course material and did a good job pushing you to learn the material thoroughly. Some assignments even had auto-graders which I appreciated because you could roughly know your grade on the assignment before the submission deadline. To their credit, the TAs were also fairly responsive and willing to admit and correct unclear areas of assignments and exams almost to a fault. \n\nOverall I would still recommend this course as a good first A.

I agree with this but it wasn't a major headache as I've had similar experiences with other classes. Just know what you're getting into. \nThe APIs are difficult to get set up.

P4 is also pretty neat as it revolves around internet security exploits. \n\nOverall workload for this class is pretty manageable. 5-10 hours a week.

The lectures are a combination of old videos by Norvig/Thrun and new content by Thad Starner and head TA Shelly Baghi. The quality of the new content is amazing, with subtle jokes and animations; the old ones are poorer. Along with the book and lectures there is additional material usually linked to from the week's overview or some assignments, or by other students on Piazza. You might also find more content online; I personally liked lectures from the AI class at UC Berkeley (http://ai. berkeley. edu/course_schedule. html). With practically everyone drawing from the same book, you'll keep running into the same examples over and over again but sometimes having it explained by another person just makes the idea click. \n\nThere were 6 assignments, with best 5 counting towards your grade (worst score is dropped). They require you to understand the algorithms in theory and be comfortable with Python. They usually consist of several parts, starting with basics and progressively diving deeper, offering bonus points for implementing advanced algorithms described in attached papers. The assignments were the best part of the course in terms of learning but at the same time could be very annoying when you're trying to find a bug in a complicated algorithm. It's just not the type of problem you can solve quickly on StackOverflow. \n\nMidterm and final exams starting with our semester were open book. They each took about 10 hours to complete and motivated you to consult the book/lectures to fully understand the topics before committing to an answer. \n\nOn average I spent about 10 hours per week on the class (counted by Toggl) but by no means it's an easy class. Unless you're a skilled programmer and used to watching lectures at 2x speed, you could easily end up needing twice as much.",

Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions. Those fizzled pretty fast. \nI do hope to improve the course offering they 1) eliminate RPM as a project and replace it with something that actually uses/teaches the kbai concepts 2) redo the lectures to actually teach the material (with proper level of detail)",

I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers. Those were the gotchas that seemed to get majority of the Piazza posts. \nExams - These were pretty difficult. A lot of gotcha questions as well.

I learned a ton about how computers actually work, and even though I am a front-end Javascript developer, a lot of the stuff I learned somehow kept coming up at work. Now that I've finally finished, I really want to go back over everything to solidify my knowledge. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of specialization. \n\nPrerequisites: I wish I had spent more time preparing for this course by learning C better, and doing the 'C for programmers' course on Udacity. I'd also recommend going through the free online book 'OS: Three Easy Steps' (it's pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you'll get a lot more out of the course. \n\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling. \n\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them. \n\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult. If you follow along with the recommended schedule (which I didn't), you should be fine. \n\nSlack/Piazza (5% of your grade): Very active/helpful TAs and professor.",

            "text": "This is definitely THE class you need to take if you are into big data technologies. It is the most brutal and most rewarding class that I have taken in OMSCS, and it is the hardcore class I expect to see in a top MSCS program. I personally learned a ton from this course and loved it very much. But be aware of the survival bias. Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester. \n\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework. Don't be misled by the difficulty of the first homework, which only takes less than 20 hours of work if you are good at python. Homework 2~4 easily costs you 60-80 hours each. If there were no such intensity, I would not have learned so much in less than 2 months. \n\nSecond half of the class is about a research project on a topic of your choice. Personally, it's my favorite part. At this point, most survivors should be familiar with all the big data tools (spark, hadoop, etc. ) and getting ready for the real meat of this class. There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you've learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other's work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself. From what I have read as reviewer (you can see all papers of the class), most people couldn't get to the point of matching the published papers. \"Improving\" basically means a publishable work, and very few (maybe 2~3 per semester) can meet that standard. \n\nYou need true passion and serious commitment to succeed in this class.",

The assignments were mostly practical and allow for proficiency with a bunch of development tools. Programming is in java, and db experience helped a lot with the group project. Speaking of the group project - I had a wonderful group and really enjoyed the group assignments, however some had a more negative experience. We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given. \n\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years.",

Some projects are more survey-like, basically running some commands and writing reports. You need to study the lectures and read papers as well. If you have programming experience, you should be fine to complete the projects. I find it interesting that some people claim they have no experience in python and find coding projects very hard. They probably have no programming experience as well but it does not change the fact that many projects are really not about the programming itself, all programming language uses in the course projects are basic. It is more about the course contexts rather than some language gimmicks. What I really like as well as other courses is that by studying the tests, I am forced to learn the concepts in depth, not just recognize the terms. You have to write essay answers in tests.

You will hate it because you will see lot of mathematics which requires a very deep understanding of linear algebra. I mean real understanding of what matrices are, not just knowing the definitions or tricks to solve them. You will love professor Bobick and his humor during the lectures. His lectures were very useful to simplify things, and you won't appreciate his excellent explanation unless you try to read a CV book. I must admit, I didn't fully understand all the math behind many topics but I fully understood the intuition behind them. The beauty of this course is that you will have 8 problem sets which will teach the course literally. I enjoyed every problem set from 1 to 8. The only trivial one was PS1, but all subsequent problem sets will require many many hours of hard work. After this course, you will appreciate math and what it can do for you, appreciate ML and will strive to take any course related to it. In my opinion, this reflects the success of this course generally. If anyone want to take this course, then prepare yourself with enough Python knowledge and linear algebra since you will need them. Also, start any problem set as soon as you can and always check Piazza and slack group since you will find great community who will help and encourage you. I'm happy that I've taken this course as my first course since I've learned many great things and it also gave me enough enthusiasm energy to explore more about ML.

The professor basically lets the TAs run the class. \n\nAssignments\n\nMost of the assignments in this class are difficult. For instance, I spent over 30 hours on assignment 2. The remaining assignments were not usually as bad. That being said, I got A's on every single assignment, so if you have the time to put into them, you should be able to do well. The assignments consist of both programming and a report. The reports have little writing, but it's a TON of parameter fitting. In some cases, finding the best parameters is harder than coding the algorithms. \n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures were informative and funny. However, there are so many of them that it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. Most of them are not directly applicable to the assignment, so there is a temptation to skip those. I do not recommend that. \n\nFinal\n\nThe final was weird. 15% of our grade, but it was under 40 questions. Most of the questions were not that hard. The study guide given to us covered most of it (though, no collaboration on the guide was allowed). In my opinion, if you found much of the lecture content going over your head, then it is absolutely necessary to study for the exam. \n\nSuggestions\n\nTo me, the #1 pre-req for this course is strong programming skills. Everything is done with Python, numpy, and OpenCV. If you don't know Python, this course could be a struggle for you. I picked up numpy and OpenCV during this class, but any experience with those tools will help you. #2, brush up on linear algebra. Many of the assignments require it. However, you'll find that the assignments explain much of it for you, and the TAs may help you with it during office hours. \n\nSo far, I have also taken KBAI, ML4T, SDP, and Networks. This class was significantly harder than all of those. I got an A, but it took many hours.",

The instructors did a great job to design the individual assignment, which wraps up the important concepts and techniques of the entire course nicely. To me, the most challenging part of the course is the group project, this is partial due to the time commitment to work together with one free rider in the team.

I have never once had the need to \"translate\" requirements into any kind of UML diagram.

The first half was great at going into depth at each subject, but the second half was definitely rushed, as if we were running out of time faster than the instructors had planned. I'd wished the pace had been quicker towards the beginning, so we'd have more time to look at interesting topics like logic, logic-based planning, and machine learning (though, I understand the last one's covered in another course) - perhaps ML could've been shorter or non-existent, and be deferred entirely to the actual ML course, so we'd have more time for other concepts?",

            "text": "I was a big fan of this class even though the exams killed me (I did not prepare well enough for them, totally on me). Here's the breakdown of assignments:\n\n10 quizzes - these are all easy and straight from the book and some lectures. Mostly quizzing you on definitions and a few characteristics of certain ideas. Very few times will you find a \"gotcha\" type of question here. \n\n4 Projects - Project 1 was a stack overflow exploit in C. I was new to both C and this type of attack so there were some growing pains here (plenty of resources online). Project 2 I had a blast with, we analyzed malware running on VMs. Project 3 was about decrypting keys using Python. This was a lot of fun even though the grading came back less than I expected, probably my favorite project I've done in this program. Project 4 was all about using Javascript to exploit XSS attacks. The gotchas in this project were a bit rough for me but I got graded really well. \n\n2 Exams (not open book/notes) - It seems that most of these questions came from different places from the text and lectures. At times they could seem like really minute details for questions but it is what it is. If I were to have to do this class over I would go through all the lectures and take notes. This would have helped me a lot. Also the proctoring was a hassle for some students (I had no issues). \n\nExtra credit project - this is offered to give you an additional 10 points to your final grade. Unfortunately part of one of the extra credit projects is totally a \"get all the points or none\" kind of or deal. Seems like an odd format for students who need additional help. \n\nOverall you should get a decent-good grade in this course. I enjoyed it and at times wish I could have focused more on certain aspects of InfoSec. A whole course on network security, or malware, or decryption would be a ton of fun! I recommend this course to anyone, just do a better job of taking lecture notes than I did.",

I felt the final was very fair and interesting. Several students had issues with it, but those appeared to be more related to how proctor-track displayed (or hid) the exam questions, rather than with the content itself.

And it shows. At the end of the semester, a student-run survey found that 15 students learned more on their own versus 2 students learned more from instructions. This is a lost of instructional goal. \n\nThe course composes of 2 unrelated parts. The first part has 4 assignments. The second part has 1 open-ended project. You are assumed to know Python, Scikit-Learn, HDFS, HDMR, Hive, Pig, Scala, Spark, GraphX, MLlib, Zeppelin. The provided environments are versions of both local and AWS Docker containers, and Vagrant images with CentOS, CoreOS, and Ubuntu. This gives a feeling of a kid playing with various toys and can't decide which one to take home. The issue is worse when you find out that the provided scripts don't even work out of the box! It is a lost of focus. \n\nThe open-ended project suffers from many problems. When the assignments are graded based on accomplishments and correctness, the project is graded like an English literature class. You can earn good chunk of points by making a video capturing your presentation skills, even if your project is a complete failure. Yet you don't earn any more point for taking more innovative or difficult approaches than other students. This is a lost of consistency. \n\nThis course is completely lost in the big world of data science. You'll be wandering aimlessly too if you follow this course. \n\nHaving said that, this course would be an easy A if that was all you'd care about. You just simply have to work really hard on it. It is a \"work hard, not smart\" kind of course that loses my interest quickly. \n\nGood luck!",

            "text": "Several changes were introduced this semester to address many of the concerns raised by students in previous semesters. \n\n- There were no graded homework assignments. Instead, there were problem sets which students were free to discuss on Piazza. \n\n- The absence of graded homework assignments was compensated by more exams. Instead of 2 exams, there were 5 exams! However, each exam covered only three weeks of material at a time, so it was manageable. \n\n- There were several supplementary YouTube videos that helped clarify concepts that were inadequately addressed in the Udacity lectures. \n\n- There were several office hours and, unlike in the past, these were available for viewing on YouTube at later times. \n\nIn my opinion the above changes were a big improvement over the previous formats and this was clearly manifested in the smaller withdrawal rate and improved overall grade distribution. The final grade distribution was:\n\nA \t101 32. 0% \nB\t115 \t36. 4% \nC\t10 \t3. 2% \nD\t3 \t0. 9% \nF\t0 \t0. 0% \nW\t87 \t27. 5% \n\nThis does not mean that the course has been compromised and watered down. Rather, by streamlining the content and redesigning the grading criteria, the learning process has become less burdensome and unnecessary restrictions and time sinks have been eliminated. The course content is still the same, so students still have to put in several hours of work. \n\nPersonally, for me, this course was a great learning experience. I took this course by itself so I was able to manage without too much stress. Since my undergrad was not in CS (I have a masters and PhD in Aerospace engineering), I prepared for this course by:\n\n1. Reading \"How to Prove it\" by Daniel J. Velleman. \n\n2. Watching the Harry Porter videos series (based on Sipser). \n\n3. Reading up on the basics of graph theory and related algorithms\n\nEventually, despite not having a math or CS undergrad, I was able to score 97. 33% at the end of 5 exams.

So it is a double whammy!\n\n3) One TA admitted to me that they were instructed to be extremely stringent in grading. Tons of marks were deducted for very flimsy reasons. Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn't change anything. No motivation to study, correct the mistakes and improve at all. \n\n4) Tries to cover a lot of topics without giving sufficient, valid examples (eg. OCL).

The instructors and TAs were readily available and concerned with students learning the material and being able to make it through. The lectures and papers covered a lot of material, particularly after the midterm, so it pays to stick to the schedule even when there are no firm deadlines. Two of the four projects (1st and 3rd) can be quite time-consuming, particularly if you aren't strong in C. I found the grading to be fairly lenient on the assignments. About 2/3 of the material happens after the midterm, making the final challenging. There were several extra credit opportunities, and the instructor indicated that there would be a fairly healthy curve on the final grades, so there is room to make mistakes and still get an A. \n\nThe one weak spot of the course, in my mind, was the second project, which seems to have evolved over time, but is still hanging onto an accompanying Udacity sandbox that is irrelevant, at best, or misleading, at worst. The grading for this one also struck me as strange. I see the point(s) that the project was trying to convey, but think that it could be accomplished better in a different format.",

You will need to be familiar with Python and understand algorithms to an extent. For the Python skills you can take Udacity's Intro to Algorithms course which I had gone through only about a third of its material but it was enough for me to be able to successfully complete the projects that required a better Python understanding. There were 8 projects in total. The instructor was considerate that in some cases a student may have trouble reaching a solution, so for everyone assignment credit is explicitly given for turning something in that shows you had at least put forth some effort. \n\nThe exams were pretty challenging but the grading was fair. They were a mix of multiple choice and short answer. Multiple Answer Multiple Choice questions seem to be a theme throughout many of Georgia Tech's courses. Thankfully in this course they weren't all or nothing. Just be sure to only mark the ones you know or are pretty confident in and you'll likely reduce the damage. For test prep I would suggest focusing on understanding the topics covered in the study guides provided by the instructor. Then you can go over the test prep questions and solutions that were also provided. The professor was good about including the topics you should look over to be successful on the exams.",

Well for the part I covered (about 55%) the course per se is not extremely hard if you strictly look only at the concepts, what makes it hard are the projects and the exams. In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course's exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don't understand the concepts well. In fact a high school student can be taught to use the formulas effectively and be made to do well in this course's exams. I did not like the fact that the course's exams only focus on arithmetic even though it is at a graduate level.",

However, I have a strong math background, and it helped me a lot. \n\nLectures: There are a lot of lecture videos. Toward the end of the class (hw 7 and 8), some of them are not needed to do the hws. However, I strongly advise against skipping any videos (cause you'll need to go through them for the final). The lectures contain a lot of mathematical proofs and derivations, so it might get a little dry. However, Professor Bobick did an excellent job of explaining them as well as the concepts and intuition behind all the math. \n\nHomework: There are 8 hw sets. HW1 is only 4% because it is easiest. Other hws are 11% each. In my opinion, HW2 and HW7 are the hardest (so get started early on these). In general, the difficulty of the hws is not in the coding, but it is the parameters. Getting the code to pass the autograder is not a difficult task. However, you'll have to pick the right parameters to produce the right images for the report (the reports consist mostly images and sometimes, short discussion, not essays). Optimizing the code was also a problem for me because I had no CS background. Overall, I don't consider the homework super-difficult. \n\nOther comments: Piazza and Slack are valuable resource, so take advantage of them. Most of the time, when I got stuck at something, the answer was in one of the Piazza's posts. Also, do watch the Youtube Office Hour videos. The TA explains how to do the hws very clearly and in detailed in those videos.",

Try your best on each problem and then look up the student answer on Piazza. This is probably the best approach to learning how to do these kind of problems. \n\nThere was an exam every 3 weeks (5 exams total) and these exams only covered the past three weeks of material plus we got a \"retry\" question from the previous exam. So each exam had one question for each week of material plus one optional retry question which covered a topic students did poorly on for the previous exam. I never did the retry question so that I could have more time to work on the required 3 problems for the exam. You have 2 hours for the exam, you also were allowed a one page handwritten note sheet for the exams. \n\nYou will need the famous CLRS textbook as well as the Intro to the Theory of Computation book by Sipser. Both books are pretty good. \n\nProfessor Pryby made some very helpful supplemental videos and office hours videos to go with the legacy Udacity videos from the previous course professor (I think his name was Charlie). \n\nOverall I prefer \"code slinging\" over theory, but this class was a good change of pace (6th OMSCS course for me).",

Having had no context on networks prior to this class, I feel like I now have sufficient knowledge of the basics and enough context to learn networking concepts on my own if I have to. \n\nIt was my first semester, and I took this class along with another course (IOS) in anticipation that CN would be pretty light, given the reviews. It was more substantial than I expected and I would put it at a \"medium\" in terms of difficulty, now that I've finished. \n\nOverall, the assignments were great for understanding the concepts we covered in class, although I felt that some were not substantial or applicable enough. For example, there was one assignment, which was one of the more difficult assignments, that more so had to do with data structures rather than networking concepts themselves. \n\nExams were thorough and I felt that they sufficiently tested my knowledge, and the instructor and TA's were very responsive. Not sure if this will be the same for subsequent semesters, but I also appreciated the quick grading! Lastly, a working knowledge of Python will be useful for completing assignments.",

Since this was my first semester, this class has set a high bar for my courses as it was very well organized and lectures were quite clear. \n\nAssignments were very helpful in deeply understanding some of the OS concepts we covered. Two of them were time-consuming, and I learned very quickly that I needed to start early in order to succeed. That said, it really helps to be familiar with C before the class; I think a lot of people will agree that one of the reasons why the first assignment is so tough is that many people are learning C in the process of doing that assignment. \n\nThe exams (midterm and final) are tough and cover a wide range of concepts, some of which can get very dense. So again, it is best to start very early when studying for the tests -- do not cram!\n\nThis class was definitely challenging but certainly worthwhile. Grading was tough but fair, and you are set to succeed if you put in the effort, even if you make mistakes along the way. It was intense at times and sometimes stressful, but so worth it.

Overall, IOS was a great class for learning more about Linux OS internals, developing against a Linux VM, and getting familiar with the whole OMSCS process. I’ve been out of school since 1995, so this was a nice way to ease back into academics. \n\nThe course grade was 25% midterm, 30% final, 40% projects, and 5% Piazza participation. The midterm covers the first 3/8th of the lectures, and the final covers the last 5/8th. Both tests used lots of multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers to be selected. Overall, the tests were tough but fair. I really liked the coding projects (P1, P3, P4), and project 2 was an interesting experiment. Dr. Ada and the TAs were great overall, and the autograders for the coding projects were very good. \n\nOver the 16 weeks of the course I spent the following hours per week: 16, 27, 19, 5, 9, 14, 12, 11, 28, 11, 14, 7, 16, 0, 17, 12. That’s 218 hours, averaging 13. 6 hr/wk. I stayed ahead, read all the referenced papers (14), and did some additional research. The weeks where I put in 27 and 28 hours were when projects 1 and 3 were first assigned. \n\nI’m only taking one OMSCS course at a time due to family and work commitments, and this was a great first course. I got an A without the curve. My only complaint was that we didn’t get grades for projects 3 and 4 until after the final was over. So, for most of the course, you have to guess how you’re doing based on whether your projects passed all the autograder tests. But when you’re only paying $500 for a course, you have to give up something, which in this case was quick grading feedback from TAs who are also GT students.",

The TA was doing his best to be helpful and was for the most part responsive, but it was clear that he was overworked. The HWs and projects were not graded in a timely manner. Half of the HWs were not graded by the end of the course (though to the TA's credit, he offered to consult individually for students to see where they stand in the course prior to drop date). \n\nThe midterm was pretty difficult. The final was made to be no-notes, no-calculator, and no-scratch paper. The result was that it was a lot of hand-wavy sort of conceptual questions (poorly-worded questions like \"what would be the more likely outcome if... \" sort of questions) - which I do not excel in as indicated in my grade in the final. \n\nThe projects were not too bad if you have previous C++ experience like I did. But I question the usefulness of these projects in learning the concepts. But yes - in the end, you're interpreting thousands of lines of code and changing 10 of them. \n\nI think the biggest problem is that the subject matter was just too academic for me to relate to in terms of generating excitement.

The exams were to be hand written, scanned and uploaded. There are some suggestions on the slack group. \n- Start working on the problem sets as early as you can. The problem sets were much harder than what showed up on the actual tests. \n- Make sure you are able to solve all the problem sets. Many times, the exam questions tended to be very similar to some of the problem set questions. \n- Don't feel bad if you are not able to solve the pre-requisite questions. I spent a lot of time preparing for the course, but was not able to solve most of the pre-requisite questions. However, I ended up doing quite well in the course. \n- 5 tests actually made it easier as each week, we just had to master 3 different topics. There was no cumulative final. \n- Join the slack group. You don't need to be active, but do keep an eye out on the discussions. You will learn a lot here. \n- Listen to all the office hours (good or bad). \n- There are lot of external resources which are much better than the Udacity videos. Check the slack group for links (e. g. Harry Porter's videos, MIT algo course, Stamford's Roughgarden's etc). You can go through the topics as they come up each week.",

The topics mostly come from papers published 20-30 years ago but are still relevant (some are the foundations) of modern operating systems. \n\nProjects are interesting but require solid foundation in C/C++. You wouldn't want to spend time familiarising with C/C++ while the projects itself require significant time from design to implementation to testing. Plan to spend at least 30 hours to finish each of the project. At least one project requires you to start from scratch without any template. The good news is grading is quite lenient and often TAs forgive small mistakes or inaccuracy as long as the codes reflect your understanding of the materials. \n\nPiazza is moderately active, questions about course materials are usually answered during office hours. Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary. I wish I had more time to spend time reading those papers, as throughout the semester I only managed to read ~30% of them. However if you watch the lectures, you should be able to do ok in exams. \n\nExams are, as others have stated, brutal. The midterm average was 58. The exams require good understanding of the course materials plus *very* good memorisation. Some questions from past exams reappear so don't forget to review them. \n\nThe grade is curved hence the grade will be relative to others'.

It is a shame because the instructor is really keen on making the experience very educational and fun. He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade.",

There is no textbook and no exams. Just quizzes and projects. I really enjoyed the projects because they were opportunities to apply course concepts. We learned Git, Android development, MD format, JUnit testing, and so much more! Many of the tools, such as IntelliJ and Android Studio (and even Git), I had never touched before. I learned so many useful tools and concepts that directly applied to my professional work. \n\nAlthough the majority of reviewers rate this course as easy, I caution others not to under-estimate the effort required. I finished with an A but it did require an all-nighter once or twice to meet deadlines and weekly deliverables. Having a programming background definitely helps, especially Java. If you have zero programming background or you're not strong in it then be prepared to suffer a little. The course will not be impossible but I found it challenging enough to meet deliverables because the week seemed to go by so fast between keeping up with lectures, quizzes, and the assignments themselves. I have over 10 years experience developing in C++, C#, Java, VB. NET, SQL, and some HTML and PHP and I felt I was barely prepared. There was still a lot of new learning I had to do and had to do it fast in order to complete assignments on time. I am thankful my group had others with programming experience.

Assignment time started very short, but then ramped up to be very large. I found the 10 questions on project 1 were taking 9-10 hours each, which got to be a real problem. It felt like the instructors had not done the assignments themselves and didn't have a good understanding of their sizing, plus ambiguity and uncertainty in grading (only 1 HW was returned by week 8) made you tend to overdo everything. It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature.",

I was very stuck on both thus far, not because it was necessarily difficult but because there was little documentation or little knowledge given to us about the project. On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would've just been completely stuck). A lot of time is also spent configuring the VM, downloading files/applications, and installing everything just to begin the project - why the instructors/TAs don't do this themselves and then provide the VM is beyond me. \n\nI would strongly suggest to avoid this terrible class.

You're provided with a scanner that gives you a tagged token stream and you have to write a top-down, table-driven parser, modify the grammar to make it LL(1) or as close as you can get, and produce four-address code that assumes unlimited registers as an intermediate representation. In the second phase, you perform register allocation and instruction selection and generate MIPS instructions. Although you learn code optimization, the grading emphasis is on correctness, not performance. \n\nThe project is coding-intensive. You can use either Java or C++ and are provided with a few default data structures that you may or may not use. Most of what you need you have to develop yourself. As it is a table-driven parser, your best bet is to write a code-generator that parses your grammar spec and creates the table, which is what something like yacc or ANTLR does, but you're not allowed to use those and have to write your own parser generator. \n\nThere is also a written homework every few weeks, similar to CCA in that you need to answer some think-cases, but much easier in that you’re just working through existing algorithms, not devising your own and proving they work. There is also a comprehensive final. \n\nAlthough it’s a first run, the course feels like a finished product. It is very well-run with clear requirements and the material is fantastic. Be prepared to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to get a working product unless you’ve done this before, but it is well worth it and extremely satisfying to see your baby in the wild.

If you have programmed in an OO language before, this class is a huge waste of your time. Several of the projects are tedious and are of limited value to programming In Real Life. \n\nExample: In one project the assignment asks you to write 30 black-box test cases for \"test-driven development\" - when you have the source code (that you wrote) right in front of you. Actual worthwhile tests that you might write in industry are frowned upon. The standard \"red-green-refactor\" is barely mentioned in one lecture, and never really asked for in any assignment. \n\nGrading is unbelievably slow. Assignment feedback (when you get it) is random and worthless. If you want an easy foundational class, go for it. If you want to learn something useful, avoid. This class made me seriously consider dropping out of the OMSCS program. \n\nI should say something positive. If you've never written an Android app, you'll get that opportunity. The group project is also somewhat enjoyable if you find yourself in a good group (which I did).",

The course starts out easy, first homework is very easy [introduction to R concepts and programming], second homework is moderate [introduction to ggplot2 and data visualization techniques]. The first project was analyzing movies dataset. There were ten questions with lot of subdivisions and each was equivalent to one homework. The third homework is implementing logistic regression algorithm from scratch and optimizing the code so that it runs fast thus enabling to train and test on the dataset given. I am new to ML domain, and the lecture covered in the video was not at all enough to complete the homework, I had to watch the relevant portions in Andrew NG's course to gain the intuition behind logistic regression. It was hard work but at the end, I felt good implementing the algorithm and training it. \nThis course starts off as easy and by the time you realize that the course is taking all the free time you have, it is well past the drop deadline. I would strongly advise students with no experience in ML domain to take this course as a single course.

He clearly does not take teaching nor this job seriously, nor concern about the success of the students. \nI have taken 4 classes, loved them all, but not this one. Arpana and few TAs (BTW, apparently we are all unworthy to TA Jiachen Yang) are clearly inexperienced and ill prepared. Awful communication skills, no rubric in assignments, students repeatedly complain having to read the TAs' minds but the staff so far provided no resolution regarding the issue. There are extra credit assignments that are worth 1 point each in final grade, but it's all 1 point or nothing, providing little or no incentive to complete the extra credits since they are poorly defined. TAs are poorly coordinate among themselves and routinely release contradicting information, which snowball into a sea of Piazza threads. No peer feedback, no exemplary work. Project 1 was due Mar 6, 2017, still haven't been graded as of April 4, 2017 due to some TAs dropped the ball. Not looking forward to the final exam which account for 30% of the grade.

I also heard some students filed official 'academy grievance ' and it seems administrators are on students' side. You know who is wrong now. I got an A, btw, which ensures this review is not a 'grievance'.",

If you don't understand pointers, referencing, dereferencing, data structures, etc you'll be in for a very rough ride. I 'thought' I knew C from my experience with Arudino work, but boy did I really have to play catch-up. Had I not had the Arduino experience before hand, I would likely have dropped. (A lot of people drop in the first two weeks due to poor C skills. Repeat you must already have some C experience !!)\n\nThe lectures are good and Ada know's her shit and does a good job of teaching it. I had almost no knowledge of how operating systems really worked until I took this class and now I have a much, much better understanding. I was taking this class just to fill electives, but it's one of those classes where I was surprised how much I learned (and how much I didn't know). I'm not planning on writing kernel software anytime soon, but the understanding you get from the class definitely helps even if what you mostly do is front or backend web dev stuff. \n\nAs with most other of the challenging course, start the assignments early. The forums move quickly, so if you fall behind your classmates on the programming schedule, your \"I'm just starting part A\" questions will get a lot less attention if everybody else has already moved on to Part C. If you stay up or ahead of the assignments, then the forums will greatly assist you. (My C got a lot better because I was able to stay in the general flow of the class. Had I fallen behind, I don't know that I would have made it. )\n\nSome of the later assignment build off of earlier ones, so design flaws can catch up with you later in the game. You're given very broad scope to design however you like and grading is through an API. I had a design flaw that I didn't understand that bit me on the last assignment in the extra credit sections.

If you're not, you probably will. The exams (midterm and final) are straightforward but can be a bit picky (i.e. a complicated multi-step calculation that Ada works through in the lecture videos in its entirety, but that you must reproduce on the exam without references), but the course is generous about grade cutoffs (>= 80 == A seems to be the standard) so even mediocre performance on them is not a blocker for earning a good grade in the course.",

This is sixth OMSCS course and by far one of the worst three courses I have ever taken in my entire life. I would quite the program if this were my first course. The content is very simple, some quirky R language, logistic/linear regression, and regularization for feature selection. The near nonexistence of course organization and lack of pedagogy make the course very difficult. Basically, the professor plays the video recorded by another professor and TAs do the grading without interacting to students. I requested clarification on Piazza via a private post. A TA replied after 14 days and with 3 reminders. The professor lacks basic pedagogic skills. There are a lot of ambiguities in the project spec, e. g., phrases \"describe as precise as possible\" are used in the project spec for HW2 instead of explicitly listing all items are required. Another example is that he asks the students to describe patterns in a plot and later we are penalized for not explaining the plausible reasons for the patterns according to the grading rubric. It is funny that the grading rubric is released two or three weeks after the homework were submitted. The project spec is so ambiguous that there are literally hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and contradictory information are posted by TAs and the professor. There is one TA responded students post with sarcasm and in confrontational tone. I believe this course is bad enough to raise attention from the school. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera is better alternative for basics. \n\nUpdate:\nConstant delay on releasing grade and even the final exam was released a few hours late. The last two extra credited assignment were obviously rushed out and questionably violating schools rules. Received \"A\", but this does not change facts.",

More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you'll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn't require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying. I also would have liked to do more of the coding on the projects. Except for a couple exceptions, I feel like they hand-held a bit too much (mostly already implemented, you just run them and analyze the results).",

Too much of ambiguity, too much of (needless) load, makes learning second priority., e. g. Use of loops, run it 5 times, 10 times, 500 times, sorta questions, asking Complexity, No doubt this is essentials, but DVA is not meant for that. \nAnd cryptic messages for communication, asking TA's Or Prof. question over piazza or slack, u get very terse/generic feedback. I just couldn't realize Did TA/Prof. wanted to remove ambiguity or add to it. Like any stupid student I dared sometime, to re-ask the next question, to get No further reply. \nSome of my Piazza posts remained, unanswered. If I pass this course, it would be because of my own work and students who were active and prompt on piazza. \nNewly hired Prof. n TA's, Couldn't make this course interesting, neither they could make us realize potential of the course. Project/Assignment grading took forever, Course is about to finish, and we're yet \nto get feedback for half of our work. \nWith all due respect, I really doubt their credentials, to carry on, GT plz review this staff. \nDespite student asking for ideal answers, we never got any positive feedback on it. Grading is generous at times, but, rather than that, I'd prefer, what went wrong and how can I improve it. \nOhh, and how can we forget, TA Jiachen Yang's epic sarcasm. I think This guy, should be given privilege to write, pre-requisite section of DVA/and every other subject in OMSCS for next semesters. \nFall2017/Summer2017 ** Won't recommend this course, until GT reviews this **",

I have never written Java, never been exposed to unit testing, heard of UML but never messed with it. I do have a lot of procedural based coding experience, as well as have developed a CRM using MySql back end in VBA. I have done some PhP/MySql too, but not much. \n\nI couldn't recommend a course more highly, especially for a new student in the program. Dr. Orso was a joy in class, was involved weekly, always available, active on Piazza, and the weekly office hours were fantastic. More importantly for me, the projects made me think. I always (once released) said - oh, this wont take long. Once I got into it - I realized that the assignments were a little more involved and thought provoking than I first thought. The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment. We had lectures on the subject, we used the application; however, I totally see the value in the tool, but not sure I really understand the best way to choose and assign categories and parameters. \n\nAs for the group Android project, I hit the mother-load with group members! All 4 of us put in a ton of effort on the project, and our grade reflected the work we did. We started early on the assignments, followed the instructions, completed the writing / required documentation, and by meeting multiple times during the week all assignments were submitted and complied with requirements. \n\nIf I had one recommendation, to me, the group project (15% weigh) should have been weighted higher. I certainly worked much more on that than I did on the individual project (which had 20% weight), it consumed more weeks in the course, and was a much more comprehensive effort than the individual project. \n\nTA's were Great and active daily.

Unfortunately for me, my reading comp is not what it used to be!!\n\nThe projects were great at demonstrating the subject material. However, from a non-CS background, they were INCREDIBLY (for me) time consuming, and occasionally frustrating. However, writing exploits (buffer overflows) and doing cross-site request forgeries, cross site scripting, sql injections - how cool! I havent written a line of C code in 25+ years, so learning some C and learning to use a C debugger would be helpful. I recommend starting early on the projects. Appreciated the optional extra-credit project. However, I didnt have time available during the semester (with the workload of 6300 and my job) to dedicate time to them. So, at the last minute I submitted half of the optional project 2. 5, and believe I got a few extra points to help the class average. \n\nDO follow the assignment instructions. I lost 10 points on the first assignment for placing an exploit file within my writeup, and the instructions said to attach it separately. My bad!\n\nI learned a tremendous amount in this course. Although there was minimal if any interaction with the instructor, the TAs were more than involved, had access to him (and in one instance interceded on my behalf), were highly knowledgeable and available daily. And, until the last project I didnt realize they had chat rooms during their office hours where we could get help when needed. \n\nI do have another security text I purchased a few years ago. I found the Stallings text to be an awesome asset to one's library. The book was great, and I feel was a key to the tests and quizzes. The second half of the class, given my overall daily workload, I was not able to keep up with the reading, and am cramming for the final. \n\n\nTo me, this should be a required course for anyone in CS.

I thought this course would be more focused on visualization principles. There was some ggplot experimentation with project 1, but it's mostly about using basic ML models and R to analyze data.

The projects were great and I watched all the lectures. But the quizzes, the exams, and the reading just did not help me learn at all.

They really helped me understand the material we were learning and I felt like I was able to really grasp some of the fundamental aspects of software security that I was missing from my undergrad. Since I had a computer science background these projects weren't too difficult. You'll need to know: C, Python, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. \n\nThe only other comment I have is that the TAs/Instructor didn't participate in Piazza as much as I would have liked. It made the whole semester feel disorganized. For example, the instructors didn't post anything about the first exam until 2-3 days before it opened. Makes studying pretty hard.

They give you practice exams and you work to make sure you could work out the practice exams to beable to do the quiz problems that are in the lecture to find out the actual exams are nothing like either of them. They contain alot of concept knowledge in which the lectures bareley go over.

For me I was introduced to these concepts the first time, and hence it was very time consuming to learn to think in terms of ML concepts. Projects are hard only because its vague interms of grading and open-ended-ness. This is not a bad thing, I actually liked this approach, but since its my first time, a lot of time spent is to learn to think in terms of ML. I read all the papers and most of Tom Mitchell's book - prescribed by the TAs. They are very useful to understand these concepts. One thing is assured - all this effort will not go to waste. Its rewarding because now I am able to appreciate what ML is all about. The only draw back is the course focus is not on implementing algorithms. But ofcourse if time is spent implementing them, then less time would have to be spent talking/discussing about them. In the past I have taken Andrew Ngs Cousera course on ML, ML4T and DVA. While all those courses are good in their own way, CS7641 really dives inside the different ML algorithms. For those interested in pursuing ML this is must take.",

I had completed half of the labs prior to taking the course and have taken all other ML / data courses in the program, so the machine learning and general data concepts weren't extremely challenging. The catch, though, was trying to drink from a fire hose in order to complete the homework assignments. The challenge w/ the assignments was picking up Scala, working with provided virtualized / containerized environments (for Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Zeppelin, etc. ) that weren't fully functional or compatible with the requirements of the assignment. Get ready to troubleshoot the tools you're given. \n\nThe instructor and TA were not at all very interactive on Piazza. IF we got an answer, it was often not necessarily answering the question given, wasn't complete, or so general the question needed to be asked again from a few additional angles. Many times there just wasn't a response. We completed our final project submissions and hadn't received feedback on an assignment submitted about 1. 5 months prior... most recent grading feedback was 2 months ago. TA office hours were non-existant... really were \"message the TA and hope for a response\". The prof' did host a couple opportunities to have a brief chat session to discuss the project, but this was about it. \n\nScala is nice now that I've done it, but was a bit of a paradigm shift for me, so work on it ahead of time. Aim to complete all of the labs prior to the beginning of the semester. If one could hang with the class pace of assignments for a little over half of the semester, then the 2nd portion was dedicated to an individual/group project and was much more tolerable as you could select/control the technology and environment to work within. Also, as w/ any course w/ a team project, vet a good team early. \n\nYou will pick up a lot of pertinent technology, but will work for it (find help early).",

Two of the projects involved recreating results from academic papers. In addition, it is recommended that students read through 22 academic papers throughout the course. While you can survive the course without reading most of the academic papers, it shows where the focus is. \n\nHomework felt completely unrelated to lecture material, the time needed to do homework assignments varied wildly and some of the homework and project timelines were unrealistic unless you can stay way ahead of schedule. \n\nOverall, the course felt in some ways like a disservice to the material it covers. The course material is interesting and can be used to solve very cool problems like those seen on OpenAI, however it only spent a small portion of the time solving interesting problems.",

Each homework assignment focused on a different computation technique or aspect of photography, and the coding/interactive portions were a blast. However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points. \n\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn't work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me. \n\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot. Hopefully the grading policy will get an overhaul at some point, but it's definitely manageable if you put in some extra effort. I imagine it will provide a good head start for the CV course, but I have not taken that... yet!",

Of course, my old friend Will is great as usual, I will perhaps miss his long but detailed posts on piazza in the future. \n\nBeing a graduate course, the topics covered here are fundamental, but never assume an easy \"A\". This course, arguably, has the lowest percentage of \"A\" among all the OMSCS courses. The exam questions are purposely tricky. There were four exams in total, the grade mediums are below 80 (out of 100) except one exam. Though my grades are 2~4 sd higher than the medium, but I do not believe that tricky questions are good to motivate studies. Another thing I would approach differently is the course content, instead of emphasizing on EER diagram which is essentially a formalization to represent information, I prefer to dig deeper in more practical issues, e. g., query performance optimization, normalization, or non-SQL database. In addition, I suggest to remove exam #3 for SQL and move the questions to other exams, there are so many moving parts in the course, which makes it hard to follow. \n\nIn the group project, we were asked to build a fully functional web application with a database back-end. This is not hard but you have to invest serious amount of time. I am having a hard time to believe people only spent five hours per week can contribute much to the project.

I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I'd wager. \n\nTESTS:\nThere is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper. \n\nLECTURES:\nI don't know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests. Would rather have been pointed to more reading. \n\nOVERALL:\nMy first course in OMSCS. I think this class was great and was not too hard, even without much programming or OS experience coming in.

            "text": "This was some of the densest material I’ve studied. The lectures were interesting, but so packed with material that it was difficult to absorb. Grade was determined based on 8 problem sets (partially auto-graded), peer feedback, and a final exam. Thankfully, the problem sets supplemented the material quite well, and helped me to understand some of the math and concepts that were discussed in the lectures. Even so, without a fantastic TA (Pedro) who hosted office hours every week to talk about issues in the problem set, this class would have absorbed much more time. To get over a 95% on the problem sets, you had to put in some work to show going “above and beyond” what was assigned. Typically, this took the form of an additional “challenge problem” in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field. \n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take. I felt I learned a lot of applicable material, but also felt like I had not absorbed most of what was discussed in the lectures simply due to my time constraints (also took CCA and ML4T this semester). Like most classes, you get out of it what you put into it.",

            "text": "This class was one of the most challenging, yet rewarding classes I’ve ever taken. I took an automata & complexity class in undergrad, but taking this class gave me a much greater appreciation for algorithms and the theory of computing. Despite its storied history and monstrous reputation, this class seems to have improved to the point of being one of the best classes in the program (I’ve taken 9 so far), so it’s a shame that it’s being replaced – hopefully Graduate Algorithms will be just as successful as this has been the past couple of semesters. This class was divided into three sections: algorithms (9 weeks, 3 exams), computability (3 weeks, 1 exam), complexity (3 weeks, 1 exam)\n\nSome of the bad things were still there: the Udacity videos were largely useless; I dreaded having to watch these, and was thankful for the weeks that the instructor posted new videos on YouTube that aligned more with GA. I was also able to understand material much better by just reading Sipser and CLRS and watching MIT’s OpenCourseware and UC Davis’ equivalents of the material. Having problem sets assigned solely as preparation for the five exams (each worth 20%) was great. We could propose solutions on Piazza and have TA’s or the instructor Chris Pryby (who were fantastic, btw) respond and give us hints and feedback. Tests were difficult, but fair, and there were opportunities to make up for some lost points on previous exams. No doubt the material is hard and might take some students a few semesters to get an A or B (particularly ones that have never seen the material before), but this is one class that I would recommend to anyone seeking a Master’s degree in this program.",

While it was neat to learn some Pandas and see the application of ML to the stock market, much of the ML application didn’t come until the latter third of the class. I’ve taken 9 classes in this program, and this one was the most disorganized that I’ve ever taken. Assignments were typically changed within a week of the deadline, submission windows were not open in a timely manner (in a couple of cases, only two days before the deadline), and Piazza was so noisy it became difficult to differentiate posts of actual substance (which may be credited to having 500 students in the class). Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity’s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester. Overall, this is a class that should be taken prior to ML as a sort of introduction, due to its low workload and introductory material.",

Choose your teammates wisely and finish phase 3 coding early because there is an exam and extra work in the form of sample data (3k lines of SQL inserts in our case) and a demo to prepare at the end. Phase three of the project is primarily graded via the demo where you checkout the code from github, load the sample data into MySQL and walk through the demo via Bluejeans with a TA in 25 minutes or less. Check the schedule for your semester, and if its the same, yes, finish coding early. They are not kidding about the importance of practicing the demo.

I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future.

It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken. \n\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity. The projects largely build on each other (most projects reused code from previous ones), so it's essential to stay on top of them. \n\nThe instructors and TAs were generally friendly and very active on Piazza.

I enjoyed the first half of this course, but the second half has me considering quitting OMSCS. I'm still new to the program, so my review may be slightly influenced by my disappointment in the way classes are managed in this program, but I am majorly disappointed that this class is one of the highest reviewed courses in the program. I definitely had a much more professional and all around better experience getting on campus degrees where I felt that my grades actually reflected my subject knowledge. \n\nI certainly learned a lot from the class material, so I don't feel like my time was wasted entirely, but everything else has been disappointing.",

            "text": "This is definitely not an easy class, and takes more than 4-5 hours/week of effort. The projects were interesting; some of them were challenging, and some were straightforward. A few of the projects could be huge time sinks, and could easily take 40 hours. The lectures were excellent, but to truly appreciate them, you need to at least skim the suggested readings. I personally loved reading the papers; they're entertaining, like war stories between the good people and the malicious hackers. The quizzes and the optional final exam were straightforward. I had no problems with the grading, and thought the TAs were patient, helpful, and fair. \n\nHowever, some of the students in the class were some of the most entitled I have found in the program. These students complained and demanded a lot. There were numerous requests for due date extensions with the given excuse of having full time jobs and families.... The problem is that probably 90% of us were in the same situation, and yet we still got the projects done on time. A few students missed the final exam, and blamed the instructors for the \"non-standard\" exam window. Are we in a graduate school here? Piazza was extremely noisy, and a lot of students offered opinions that caused much confusion. Academic integrity violations were rampant: students shared (partial) solutions on Piazza, discussed solutions and included code in their postings, or provided hints that reveal way too much information. TAs had to delete code from some posts, but it's not clear if the students were disciplined or not. \n\nIf you take notes during lectures, do the readings, and work on the projects carefully and independently, this class takes about 15 hours/week. But, if you don't, and simply post on Piazza asking for hand holding on every single difficulty that you run into, or wait until last minute and simply follow the \"walkthrough\" that would be inevitably built up on Piazza, then yes, this would be an easy class that would take 4-5 hours/week.",

I learned a lot, and enjoyed the class overall. \n\nThe tests were pretty rough though. I got a high A on every project, but struggled to make two C's and a B on the tests even when studying a lot. The tests felt a little bit luck-based -- did you happen to remember one sentence from one of the dozen research papers you read? If yes, it was easy. If not, then impossible to guess. I don't think the tests did a good job judging whether you'd learned the big picture or even the majority of individual topics discussed, rather they seemed mostly a sample of minutiae from the papers which you may or may not remember. \n\nOne big warning, I think they've revamped this course in the last semester or two, because it was fairly challenging (especially the tests) and took a decent amount of time each week. There's some kind of project or test almost every single week, so you really don't get much of a break. \n\nPast reviews indicated this class was easy. I don't think that's true anymore. I'd say this class is relatively *tractable* in the sense that if you can put in the time to memorize all the papers you read, and put in enough time on the individual projects, you have a very good chance of earning an A.

Some of the projects can be huge time sucks while you basically guess and check to find an acceptable answer. \n\nOn the negative side, I found the lectures very poor, like watching a video of someone reading flash cards. They contain frequent \"quizzes\" where the quiz itself is the instructional material. These aren't recaps of anything that is covered elsewhere, it's guess-and-check until you can match a bunch of terms (which you may never have heard of) to their definition, or the exact short answer they want to a vague and open-ended question. The next segment of the video will of course, not discuss the terms you just learned, but move on to something else. It's basically like having wikipedia read to you. \n\nToo often this class felt like going on a tour of the chocolate factory, being quickly rushed from room to room and being told briefly what the machines are called, then having the warning labels read out loud to you. When it was time for a project, it was like being sat at the controls for one of the giant mixers or something, told to push the red button, and write down how much chocolate comes out. \n\nI scored over a 100 (due to extra credit), but still I wish I could have a do-over and take something else instead.",

Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\n\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn't mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn't get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear. \n\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code. Also, Dr. Pryby and the TAs were responsive, fair, helpful, and awesome.",

But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I'd say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN. \n\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you'd just follow the instructions provided and write up the results. \n\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don't expect that to be a problem in later semesters. \n\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn't think so, really?

Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you're careful with your time and ask for help. \n\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take 'em seriously. Also make sure you understand and can work out the problems from the lecture quizzes that need to be done by hand, some of those will surely come up. \n\nAll told I'm glad I took the class.

The tests were made up of MCQ, true/false and some short answer (except the last test). Nothing seems to be set in stone so keep this in mind when preparing for the tests. Attending the office hours were very useful. The head TA at the time, Michael, really saved this class! The professor for the semester was really hands off. It appears she was mostly busy with other things and so we didn't get to see her much (she didn't hold weekly office hours). \n\nNote that the papers will take time to read and comprehend so if you're taking this class, try and get ahead of the readings. There's an optional textbook which I found really helpful in supplementing my overall understanding.",

            "text": "As with many previous comments, this class is really about how much you put into it. The grading is very generous and it's really easy to get grades from participation. Participation points literally rains on you from the surveys, Piazza participation, and even peer feedback (similar to KBAI). A side effect of this is that some of the peer feedback you get is pretty much generic. There are some really useful ones though so keep an eye on that. \n\nThe class's Piazza is really active and Dr. Joyner is quick to reply there and on Slack as well. Your mentor may be a hit or miss. My first mentor was great and we had lots of discussions on my research topic at the time. If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that's usually the mentor that most group members have (if there's one or is random otherwise). My group's mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn't hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team's grades was always late. \n\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you'll never be able to going at it alone. Just MAKE sure that your group mates are as interested in the idea/project as you are. I had a really great group but found out late that one person in the group was just bandwagoning and the work produced by that person really showed the lack of interest.",

All assignments had 1-2 weeks to complete and I was able to get most done in ~ 2 days (and I have very little experience in Java). \n\nThe exams are more than fair: first, provided practice exams do well to prepare students for the actual exam; second, the exams are open-notes; finally, there is nothing tricky about the exams and the questions were entirely reasonable. Follow the lectures, take some of your own notes, keep a copy of the instructor notes handy, and run through the practice exam, and you should have no trouble with the midterm/final in this course. Study for the exams earlier rather than later. The instructors (rightfully, IMO) do not answer questions about course content during the exam window, so if you wait to start studying until after the exam has opened, you may find yourself unable to get help if you're stuck. \n\nFinally, the instructors/TAs for this course were excellent. They were readily available to assist students, from Piazza to Slack to Office hours. They were courteous and respectful to students, extremely fast with grade turnarounds, and overall ran the course better than just about any class I've taken so far. No mid-assignment revisions, no absurd grading policies, no \"gotchas\".",

I have little or no complaints as far as that goes. Several of the TAs did seem to go above and beyond the call of duty to try to salvage the class. You will read a ton about the R language. If you have experience with python Pandas library, then it should be (somewhat) familiar. \n\nMy advice to potential students is to wait until they fix the class to take it unless you need it immediately to fulfill the ML specialization. My advice to GT is to cast this class back into the abyss. \n\nEDIT: Also, the extremely positive review below is bullshit. The complaints about this class are legitimate.

[Hint: if it's a Classifier, it has to pick categories, not averages. ]\n\nWhy not a perfect 5? Well, as mentioned the materials have been evolving to put more emphasis on the ML section. But what starts as well-produced, clear instructional videos gives way to a lot of fuzzy, hard-to-read slow-paced recorded in-classroom lectures with the occasional low-budget office hours to give important assignment instructions.

In general I ended up studying all the material for a very long time only to spend 5 to 10 min on each test. The testing on ladder logic was not done well since there was no effort to give partial credit. This I feel is important when testing knowledge of a programming language. \n\nThe projects were the best part of the course, but still fell short of providing that much challenge in the class. The actual tasks pertaining to the material were quite easy, but sometimes it was the preparation that took the longest. My feelings after taking the class were that homework should be given each week to introduce the students to the technologies they will be using, like VirtualBox, Wireshark and the ladder logic emulator. Therefore the projects could involve more of the class material and less learning about the project environment. \n\nLastly, TA involvement on Piazza was good. They were there to answer questions or concerns. Since the class grading involved only 5 assignments Piazza was quiet most of the semester. \n\nI would like to see this class improve since the material is current and well-delivered.

The remaining 10% is \"Above & Beyond\", which I find very motivating in terms of expanding your learning, and it can be pretty hard to get a full 100% on an assignment.

            "text": "ML4T is my first course of OMSCS. It is overall a great introductive course to machine learning and stocks. ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning). \n\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction. \n\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642. \n\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments. \n\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions.",

To put my review in perspective, I'm from EE background with little to no knowledge about computer networks prior to taking this class. I took an introduction to Python course on coursera as preparation. \n\nThe course was very well structured and the TAs (Michael Brown was just amazing) ran the show in an organized and timely manner. Professor rarely dropped by but her absence was never felt thanks to the TAs. Participation from peers on Piazza was the best part of the course. I was never stuck during the course as students quickly shared and proposed fixes for the issues they encountered. \n\nThe lecture videos were superficial and only provided an introduction to the topics. I found the reading material (papers and articles) to be quite helpful in my learning. Most of the projects were interesting. First three and last two projects required some programming in Python and I didn't find the coding hard. The remaining three projects were spoon fed through instructions and their main goal was to analyze the results and write reports. Tests included short answer and multiple choice questions and I found the difficulty level to increase from test 1 to test 3. A thorough understanding of lectures and reading material was sufficient and needed to score full on the tests. \n\nI highly disliked the weekly discussion threads where extra credit was offered for participation. Most of the students including myself posted just for the sake of it and didn't contribute to learning.",

The course contents were actually pretty good though quite light. The assignments and projects were also OK. However, the final exam and the overall grading was terrible. There were a dozen TAs, but no grading criteria or rubrics, while all assignments and final exams were essay like reports... This created a total disaster. Maybe because the grading load was too much, TAs did not seem to spend much time on (or even care about) our tens of pages of reports, and the grading was generous but quite random, with no meaningful feedback given. In fall 2016 they put some example assignments on piazza and after the exam, some students voluntarily shared their exams, but similar answers were given very different scores. One of the answers that got full score was almost identical as mine, but mine got 3/11. After I pointed out that my answer was similar to others but got significant lower score, the professor simply said that happens, but since mine was not perfect, the original grading was valid. So in the end I stuck at 79. 7 with a C... \nAdditionally, after the final exam, many students found out that they were not able to see a big chunk of the final exam-a third of the exam didn't show up on proctor track... I still don't know how they dealt with these angry students. \nI filed the grading grievance and started to take the same class again, because I needed it to graduate. As of now, I haven't heard anything from the grievance, and the semester is already ended. \nSpring 2017 is even worse, the instructor disappeared for the most part of the semester, and we only got 20% grading done two weeks before the final. There were several angry posts on Piazza, and some students filed grievances. \nFor this semester, I simply resubmitted most of my assignments with a little editing. And I got higher than 100.

Out of 35 questions, 3 were on material not covered in the course, 3 had issues that caused the instructor to admit they were bad, and 2 had multiple correct answers. To make up for these questions, the instructor added 3 points to everyone's score and then refused to take any grade challenges. This solution is unfair and took many students from an A to a B gradewise. I was fortunate to not be one of them, but this class is the worst run class I have experienced out of 9 OMS classes - I am sorry I took it!\n\nThe on-campus course this spring looks like an amazing course, dealing with lots of big data technologies. Instead, we got a basic introduction to R, which I hope to never see again - it's that poor a language choice.

They don't teach you on how to use testing tools out there in the market, instead, they teach you the techniques behind those tools. Lectures are very short, with few easy examples. Most quizzes are hard to crack. You suppose to infer the answers out of the poor explanation of the concepts. In most of the lectures, the lecturer only repeats what's on the slides word by word not explaining much of the concepts. You don't have supporting materials. If you google it, it's hard to find the concepts covered in lectures. There are only few external references. \n2. The assignments: what is hard about them is not what you have to accomplish, but instead trying to figure out the tools and topics under you have to perform. Topics like graph theory, pseudo machine code are necessary. You have to use deprecated tools that are uncommon in real life. It's hard to find documentation. You have to spend hours in learning those topics and tools before attempting to solve the assignments. The time slot is fair. Most of them have the expected output. Piazza is a great tool, and office hours help you a lot. \n3. The exams: they are open-notes. So, it doesn't not matter how many times you review the lectures, or do the quizzes or the practice exams, it will not help you at all. Exams are very hard. It is expected that you master the topics that were barely covered in lectures and apply that knowledge to unrealistic situations or algorithms. The mean for the midterm was a 32/50. You do the math. \n4. TA's are very active and very friendly, professor only showed up a couple of times in office hours. \nIn conclusion, it's a hard class because of the way it is taught, barely covering topics and expecting from you to become an expert.

No grading rubrics. \n* TAs abandoned ship after 2 weeks and we never got any response for regrading requests. My question to the instruction is still open for HW1 and haven't received a response after 3 months. \n* Lectures were shallow while the projects/assignments expected in-depth knowledge. \n* If you know ML already, u won't learn anything beyond ggplot2 (plotting few graphs). If you don't you are going to be in hell that term. \n* Final exams had questions and concepts that weren't taught in the course. \n* I don't think I would have gotten an A without taking few external ML courses which added a huge burden to the time consuming projects that are there in this course. \n* Oh and if you by mistake looked at the course offered on-campus, that is no where related to this online course. So be ready to be surprised if you thought you are going to learn some cutting edge technologies to do real world big data analytics. This course is so 15 years behind with technologies and what is happening in the industry. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this course until it is revamped with new videos, content and properly organized.",

You mostly get student feedback, which I thought was often polarized and rarely educational. (I do like the student feedback aspect though - very unique. ) Going back to the project, I felt that getting a high score by any means necessary was the way to get points, then you rationalize your approach with AI language. I tried to use lesson concepts initially and got mediocre results, but I felt that I learned a lot.

It feels like a chore to me now because of how much I really disliked doing work for this class. I'll never forget the moment when the first grade was returned in this class. The Piazza statistics for the class showed that there were 6x the number of posts of a typical day when it was released. People didn't understand what they did wrong. And it took over a week for the instructors to generate any kind of reasoning for the grading. One would think that a rubric should be available to handle discrepancies... but it didn't appear that way. For the rest of the assignments, I felt like I had to perform 150% just to get a good grade on an assignment. For the second project, my report was 40 pages long.

The midterm we got to watch a series of videos (for a few days) that went over the answers, but were never given back our answers with the scores for each.

During this course there are two tracks you can take: research or development. Both require you to conduct a mini \"literature review\" before you can begin your final project. If you choose research you will either conduct your own study or find a new way to examine existing data/studies. If you choose the development track you will create a working prototype/product. There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic. \n\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used. \n\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them. I really enjoyed working on the project and was able to produce something I had always dreamed of producing. \n\nThat last point is something that the instructor specifically designed the course to encourage. During course feedback on Piazza I said at times I felt like I was paying money to work on a hobby project. He responded saying that was the idea. This course will give you credit for working on a passion project. You can then use the results for other endeavors: publishing, PhD, or even a start up.

It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

But, the readings are great if you have time to read them. The topics are relevant to today's cyber security environment and also covers recent research in this area. Some papers go really in depth in the topic like how DNS works, etc. You also learn to use machine learning to check for network anomaly and then to bypass it which is cool. Assignments can be annoying since they require specific answers to the questions. Some assignments took more than 40+ hours to complete due to this. I suggest instructors to make the assignment more flexible and grading flexible too. If you want to learn in this course you will (provided you do the readings and assignments) and if you want to just pass it you can (but may not learn much!)",

Course material is taught clearly by the professors so understanding the material is not a challenge. You will want to review the material thoroughly as the final really gets into the details from lecture. There are a tremendous amount of interesting topics to learn even if you don't take photographs often. \n\nYou should expect to spend significant hours on the class if you want to master the assignments. I was not able to do all of the readings even spending 30 hours. If you only want to pass the class with a C or B then the 10 hour estimates are correct. First two weeks of class is only about 5 hours but it ramps up quickly. \n\nIf you are aiming for an A the majority of your time will be spent on above and beyond (independent research) and writeups. Expect about 2-3 hours a week on lecture (take notes while watching!), 5 hours on coding for complex base parts of assignments, 3-5 hours on writeup for base assignment, and the remaining time on independent research (both coding and writeups). Also a variable amount of time on taking your own photographs depending on the project. \n\nThe course will be undergoing a revision this fall so hopefully the workload comes down. Also a more flexible grading rubric (or more points allotted to overall quality of explanations) could further differentiate students who put effort into the assignments vs those who did not. I really enjoyed the class and highly recommend it.",

But if you're really going for an A, then you'll find the class taking up a lot more time. The grading structure is designed such that each homework assignment has an \"Above and Beyond\" section that counts for 10%, so to get anything higher than a 90, you'll need to develop something beyond the basic requirements of the assignment. Personally I enjoyed this a lot, but it's clear that a lot of others didn't. \n\nThis class is being redesigned over the Summer, so I don't know if any of this will hold true in the Fall though. Overall I had a great time, but for the future I hope the instructors make the writeups shorter and the coding more challenging. \n\nEdit: Also definitely do the readings! They are absolutely fascinating! But don't worry about fully understanding all of the math for each reading - you just need to get the gist of them.",

In many sections the math is glossed over, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nThe \"Above and Beyond\" portion of the grading seemed rather arbitrary and subjective to me. For one assignment, I didn't even attempt the extra 10% and inexplicably got a 94 on the assignment. On the other hand, there were other assignments that I put 8-10 extra hours in and only received 1 or 2 points. Overall the process was extremely variable. Lots of it seemed like it depended on the TA you got and what mood he or she was in that day. \n\nMy biggest beef with this class was the final exam. This was unproctored and open-everything. This sounds great, but in practice it meant a bunch of questions with tricky wording. Even that wouldn't have been bad, but tricky questions were combined with poorly worded questions, making it hard to determine a question's intent. The final basically devolved into a digital scavenger hunt. I don't think it measured my knowledge of the material at all-- just how well I could use Ctrl+F. \n\nOverall this was a decent course.

After taking one of those famed \"Baptism of Fire\" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence. \n\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better. \n\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it's really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week. \n\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful. \n\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule \"squeezes\" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments. Every assignment has a grading rubric that serves as the specs for the assignment. Read those 3 times, then 3 times again before turning in the finished assignment.",

Grading is nonsensical at times, you may get contradictory feedback like \"You should have talked about X... \" followed a sentence or two later by \"I see you did mention X... \" and yet you will still get docked 20% without good reason. You will be told things like \"You don't need to memorize formulas\" and \"You won't need a calculator\" for the exam, and then the exam will expect you to have memorized a formula and do the formula calculations by hand or in your head without a calculator. The grading curve is complete nonsense, you can \"fail\" by traditional standards and still get an A in the class. The assignments will not come with complete expectations in the requirements, you may get some more of the requirements by bugging the TA's during office hours but it is still not guaranteed. If you ask for an example of what is expected you will be told \"No, because then you might parrot the example\" and the professor wants you to \"be creative\" except that the TA's will penalize you for missing something expected in the hidden grading rubric that they wouldn't tell you about or give you an example of. Responses on Piazza are few and slow, especially for such a large class. Slack is a much better source of quick information but it may not be \"good\" information when it comes to things like the hidden grading rubric. \nThe class seems to be run, and definitely graded, as though it were a meta commentary on the accuracy of machine learning in general.

Class was well run and the grade distribution for projects and test was done fairly.

Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures. \n\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline. There's a team project, and of course, YMMV based on the strength of your team. Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\n\nOne of the more interesting experiences you'll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn't work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course.

I knew the first 3 and took the \"labs\" before starting the semester. The labs are basically non graded tutorials you do on your own to learn Scala/Spark and other tools. Even with the labs and some background knowledge (I took Machine Learning before), the homeworks could take you 60 hrs. My life could have been much easier if I knew Scala before hand, but I learn while taking the class. If you survive the 4 homeworks with a decent grade, the second part is much easier - basically a project (a paper) about a Healthcare related topics from a list of topics suggested by the Professor. TLDR: Do the labs and learn basic scala before the semester starts and you will be fine. Still time consuming",

            "text": "The summer schedule seems incredibly compressed. The first 3 assignments & the individual project were doable with the 1 week/submission schedule. However, the second phase of M assignments go through a complete cycle of a UI design, from needs finding to prototype construction and evaluation. Almost all of these all require input from an external group: either friends or family or the other students for the need finding and review activities. The same has to be done, this time in a group context for the group project. A little more time is allowed for the group project as it only has to be in at the end of the semester. \n\nThe logistics of that into a forced march of a 1 week cadence make this unworkable for me to integrate into work&school&travel. \n\nI think if one is able to dedicate a non Summer semester to this alone, it could be doable. But for Summer, I think the course workload is unrealistic. Just too much logistics which detract from the content. It would be better to have a single project, with enough time to get all the reviewers logistics organized and submit towards the end of the semester. I don't think it's necessary to have a group project. Any advantages from a group can be had from allowing students to review the various steps, and better yet, be able to incorporate that feedback into your work. (The way a real review at work would be used). \n\nBTW one disappointment is that in order to have a project you can use at work, you need to submit an application to an IRB of some sort. Again this throws in a logistical detail, as something like cannot be organized within a week, yet, that's all you have if you keep to the 1 week cadence. Without some incredible foresight or preparation, the whole thing is unworkable for a custom project. You basically *have* to take a play project, and use your fellow students as the users. \n\nBBTW I seem to be writing about a different course than the people below, perhaps the assignments were reworked?",

Although the first few lectures covered that material, the course then proceeded toward compiler-level analysis of source code. This was not what I was expecting/wanting from this course; I previewed the remaining course materials and decided that this course wasn't really going to be applicable to my interests/career. I've decided to withdraw from the course. I'd say that this course is more oriented toward OMSCS students whose background is in CS and compilers rather than a software engineering type. I thought the lecture material was fairly dry, and failed to provide much context for the concepts and algorithms being presented. I completed the first 3 assignments and felt that they were somewhat useful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture, but I spent most of the time trying to read the (generally sparse) documentation for the tool. This summer (2017), the instructors provided excellent midterm preparation material for the midterm exam, but the exam was still challenging (took me 2 hours to complete of the 3-hour window). I thought the grading was strangely harsh for some relatively minor errors (my opinion) in homework submissions. \n\nI feel like the course kind of hangs you out to dry on the assignments in terms of support. The lectures cover the concepts, but the assignments are basically \"Read the manual for this tool, and implement stuff. \" I've taken enough well scaffolded courses to know that this is not the best way to teach people (throwing them into the deep end). \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I was disappointed in the content of the course, since it didn't really focus much on software testing but mostly low-level analysis most suited for compilers. If you're into that type of thing, this course may be for you. I ended up withdrawing from the course for these reasons.",

The course covers all compilers phases. Lectures are crystal clear. Professor has been very committed to the office hours (weekly), open to different types of question. TA is very prompt, rarely let a day pass with unresolved piazza questions, with clear concise answers. \n\nProgramming projects! Not for the faint of heart. Implemented either in C++ or Java. No starter code. As I understand, the summer version of the projects is a bit different than Fall/Spring which included more compiler phases but with starter code. Be very well prepared with one of those 2 languages. And explore data structures, you'll need to use lots of sets, vectors, stacks,... etc as well as structs. Projects can be done solo or in teams of 2, but we were strongly advised to work in teams. And having taken the solo option and spent tons of time to keep up with this choice, I recommend you find a team mate unless you're an experienced programmer. \n\nThere are 2 projects, the first is a front-end project where you implement a simple scanner, and implement a parser generator and an LL(1) parser. The second project was much harder, where you implement 3 methods of register allocation on IR code and convert the code into assembly, and simulate the assembly using SPIM simulator. \n\nThere were 4 HWs, that take a bit of time, pen and paper work, but they were excellent in measuring how well you undrstand the material. \n\nThere's a final exam, haven't taken it yet, but it should cover the entire syllabus. \n\nAs I remember Projects: 35%, HW; 35%, final exam: 30%\n\nPerhaps the only con would be the absence of an auto grader, and being given basic tests to try our code against, you will have to devise your own tests, otherwise risk failures with the grading tests. \n\nHighly recommended.",

Point of perspective, the whole Deep Mind / Alpha Go think is built on top of the content of (RL). In general though, there is no teaching and it's more like a sink or swim class, more like you are generally expected to know the content up front (90%) and the remaining should be easily learnable. I definitely did not come in with any RL knowledge at all. I made it, but the way the course is structured made it a lot more difficult than it should be. \n\nNegatives:\nToo many lecture readings per week. Who has the time to read 3-5 academic papers a week and absorb the content? I understand maybe 1-2, but to ask students to read 50-100 pages a week is a bit much. \nHomeworks not useful. \nNo coordination between HWS and Projects. HWs usually prep you for a project. This is not the case at all in this class. They are almost a unnecessary distraction. \nProjects were graded on how accurate can you reproduce a paper. I think this type of grading is poor, considering the people that wrote the paper, have usually have significantly higher qualifications then an OMSCS student and probably spent a couple months creating the results of the paper where OMSCS students have around two weeks to hack around and get the same results even though yes the equations are in the paper but they take a long time to understand and figure out. \nTA office hours not helpful. \nLectures need to be cut down. Who really has time to watch 3+ hours of lectures a week. Streamline to 1-2 hours. \n\nPositives:\nTA hands on sessions are useful. \nProject's content are really interesting. \n\nIn general, the course has potential. The problem is it's really meant for folks right know with a basic knowledge of RL versus none. HWs need to be revamped to intro to a project, example, a HW could be done on linear programming with probabilities as a trivial example as basically project 3 that's all it's about.",

Unfortunately, right now, I'm cramming facts for the exam (25 T/F with \"twitter style\" answer justifications). During the summer session you have something due every week, with 2 homeworks and 1 project released simultaneously every 3 weeks and I found myself not having much time to spend on anything else other than getting those done. I did the best I could to get the homework done as early as possible to maximize time spent on the projects. \n\nI disagree with criticisms of the TAs this summer. These guys were great, worked hard, and likely felt the pressure of the compressed schedule more than we did, especially since the profs were absent - the TAs completely ran the course (and did a pretty good job IMO). \n\nThe only ML background I had coming in was ML4T and I didn't feel that I needed any more than that as preparation. Its a good class, if you take it in the summer, know that it will be a lot of work.

Instead, it asks you to memorize concepts, protocols, and several shameless plugs from the instructor. \n\nDon't let the first few videos fool you with that hard yellow hat or the substation in the background into thinking the instructor is passionate about the class. On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I'm not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students. If there's anything you'd learn in this class, unprofessional attitude is surely one. \n\nThe remaining of the videos are paraphrases from books, with a bunch of fundamental errors sprinkled in for taste. You're expected to remember all of that, including misinformation. \n\nThe mini projects (i. e. homework) are ill prepared. Unlicensed Windows, outdated software, non-working environment, etc. These issues were reported in earlier semesters but none bothered to fix them. The staffs just don't give a f*ck. And the previous sentence is my only review about the staffs. \n\nThe exams, as mentioned before, expect much rote-learning. But questions are badly written. In a true/false setting, most questions can go either way depending on the (missing) context. There is no way to reason them out, even security pros fail to match the answers. The final is especially terrible. Scheduled for ~3 hours, many completed in ~3 minutes. This class obviously does not meet any educational standard. \n\nTo recap, taking this class would set you back a few steps on your way to a good job. There are better security classes in the OMSCS program. But please do take this class if learning-by-rote is your kinda thing and you want to sell security to your boss.

I tracked the time I spent on this class down to the minute, and spent an average of 9 hours a week watching lectures, doing assignments, or reading Piazza. This is definitely a class where you'll get out of it what you put into it. There are extra reading assignments that you can do (for fun), you can interact on Piazza about questions offered up in the videos, and Dr. Joyner really tries to facilitate student interaction on Piazza. Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken). \n\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week's span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems. \n\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes.

It sometimes feels more like a survey of a wide range of industrial control topics with an emphasis on the power grid. The problem is that it's a poorly written book in both language and conceptual layout. For example, you find repetition of facts at the beginning, middle, and end - but all high level concepts without specifics. \n\nTechnical papers the professor wrote were more interesting than anything in the book, and I wish the professor focused more on his work instead of the book - \"Industrial Network Security\". There was a little bit of opinion/politics thrown into a couple lecture - and this is my ultimate pet peeve. \n\nNot too much detail on most topics or specific technical challenges like you will find in nearly every other OMSCS course. Two of the three projects allow for a slightly deeper dive, but still not what you would expect from your average GT graduate course. The instructor did post a few things throughout the semester on piazza, but TA involvement was puzzling. Although the TAs do answer random questions, you definitely get the feeling that the TAs have a lot better things to do than answer questions on piazza. Even with that our TAs still really seem like great people, and I liked them. \n\nThe hardest part of the course is having so few grading events. There are two tests and three projects. And the tests are not long, so you have to make each grade count. \n\nI write a review for every class I take, and this will be the first negative review for any class. That probably speaks to the strength of OMSCS. It's not a BAD class, per se, but it does not stand up to many of the others. And that's a pretty high bar.",

So what's the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can't even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B's just due to there being few grading events that don't measure your understanding very well.

We periodically touched on security here/there, but much more of the focus was on a very wide brief introduction to a wide variety of systems and protocols with a never ending list of acronyms. I would have preferred much more time spent on the application of security (e. g. here's a situation... this is what was done to secure it... or here's an case where there was an exploit, this is what was done to discover it, this is how it could have been discovered earlier, this is what was done to fix it -- in other words, learning from other's mistakes and analysis). \n\nThe projects were very lightweight and completed with minimal time and effort. Others had trouble getting the systems up/running, but I did not have that issue. \n\nThe other half of the grade for the course is tied up in hair-splitting true/false questions on two tests (both of which have a fairly limited number of questions). \n\nI think the course needs some work to take some slices of it deeper and give up on some of the broadness of the topics covered.",

However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures).",

Each assignment applies a specific portion of the class which allows for you to solidify the content in the lectures. \n\nThe main negative I have is that the summer class felt rushed, and there was this heightened level of stress throughout the semester as there was something new to do every week. There is no breathing room, which I suppose is common for a summer course. It is possible to front load things early on, which is a HUGE plus to me. \n\nNOTE: a review below says you have to fill out your own application to an IRB, that is not true. There is a class wide umbrella. You DO have to take an online class to understand what an IRB is, how it is applied, etc. That takes a couple of hours, and is MORE than just logistics.

The course was very challenging, but part of the challenge is tied into taking the course in the summer. With 6 homeworks, 3 projects and a final added on top of 20+ hours of lecture and 25+ papers to read, it's a lot of content for an 11 week (really, nothing much is available the first week, so 10-week) semester. \n\nThe TA group was top-notch - the best group of TA's I've encountered. \n\nThe projects were challenging, but fulfilling to get them done, similar to ML in that respect, but definitely a lot more hands-on. Also, you are expected to both write a short (3-page) paper and complete a short (5 minute) video presentation for each project. \n\nThe homeworks can be hit or miss. Of the 6, 3 were somewhat time consuming, and 1 of the 3 was extremely time consuming, however that may change in future semesters as they have been adjusting the HW to move towards a more auto-graded style. 5/6 were auto-graded and the one that was not was the extremely time consuming one. \n\nThe final exam is challenging, but fair, in it's current format. This is speculation, but given the expected 2 weeks to study in a normal semester, it would likely have felt a bit more manageable to review all of the content. \n\nOverall, I thought the course was worthwhile, but it is definitely not one to take lightly with regards to workload or effort required.",

At one point I really thought, if you know it then you got it else drop the class and that was the worst feeling ever. \n\nNote: I have seen TAs doing better and great job in order to help folks and in making understand assignments better in other courses e. g. CV (King Pedro rocks!!). \nFelt like Miguel, Tim and Chris were the only TAs who were proactively participating and other TAs were nothing more than project graders. \n\nI read somewhere in below comments that TAs were as busy as we were but I don't understand what made TAs busier than us as Hws were autograded and only thing that TAs were busy with Project grades (as well finals and HW5) and just one office hour per week (ignoring the 2-3 hands on session given by Miguel/Chris). Moreover, that was part of their job to support all these activities. \n\n6 TAs joining same Office hour per week, could not understand that thing.

On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful. \n\n2. ) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles. \n\n3. ) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/\n\n4. ) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the \"www. \" on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade. TAs had to regrade nearly every project and it was like pulling teeth to get them to realize their mistakes.

I took 30+ and almost 40 hours for project 2 and project 3. You need run some jobs. and it may take a one day, sometimes two days. Also, you need better computer with GPU. Please buy a computer with GPU. It really helps a lots. \n\nAlso there are lots of papers need read. Some video I did not understand, I watched David Silver (youtube version RL Course by David Silver) or Andrew Ng (youtube version from lesson 16 to lesson 20) first. then watch video again. it helps a lot. But for summer, it was short time. and if you had full time job. I think you need sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 AM for paper and video. and get up at 7:00 AM for job from Monday to Friday. and no weekends, because you need finish your HWs or Projects every weeks. So i think no life if you plan to take this course at summer. BTW, TA is best. helpful and very great.",

            "text": "As others have mentioned, the workload was very high over the summer. I believe there were only 2 projects for Summer 2016 - we had 3 projects, 6 homeworks, and a final for Summer 2017. This meant something was due every week, with projects due every 3 weeks. \n\nI'd say this course in the summer is at least as much work as ML in a full semester, if not more. I wish I had taken it in a full semester, as even doubled up with another class I think the slower pace for the projects would have been extremely helpful. \n\nRegarding the course overall, I liked it, but not as much as I was expecting to. The lectures were great, the volume of expected readings was overwhelming, and I have mixed feelings about the projects. I really enjoyed the second project (Lunar Lander), where we used cutting-edge RL techniques to solve an OpenAI Gym problem. The first and third projects were both replicating results from papers, and I found I don't enjoy that very much. I think it's a valuable skill to have, but the emphasis was too heavy on it. My ideal would be to keep the first project as a paper replication project, but replace the third project with one similar to the second (where we read papers to learn the techniques and apply them to solve a challenging problem). I actually quite enjoyed the material the third project focused on. \n\nI also didn't really see the point of submitting both a 3-page paper and a 5-minute recorded presentation (with an exception for project 2, where it was neat to be able to show videos of my agent playing Lunar Lander). I think this is a common complaint, as the TAs polled the class on our preferred submission format, so I think this might change going forward. \n\nOne last thing, Dr. Isbell was almost completely absent from Piazza (I knew from reviews here to expect this, but it's a big departure from ML). The TA team was exceptional and did a great job of running the course, especially Miguel and Tim, but I wish Dr. Isbell was more active.",

            "text": "I loved this class and wish more courses followed this format! It's an almost completely open-ended class where you propose a project and then work on it throughout the course. The professor and TAs are good about making sure you know the expectations for the class, that you keep your scope for you project reasonable, and that you are roughly on track throughout the course. If you prefer a more structured course, you may not enjoy this course, however if you like to work on a project that interests you personally and have a ton of creative control then you will enjoy this class. \n\nI would suggest having a rough idea of what you would like to do for the project going into the course. However if you aren't sure, educational technology is a pretty broad field and the first few weeks are spent researching various topics in the field to help you brainstorm ideas. \n\nAs far as grading and workload, the expectation is that the scope of the project itself will be about 100 hours. This amounts to 10-15 hours of work each week. You should be able to earn an 'A' if you put in the time and communicate your progress (even if you end up behind your original schedule). Difficulty is really how familiar you are with the work you do for the project, and since you choose what to work on you can control how much you want to branch out there. \n\nTaking this course over the Summer is tougher but do-able, you are looking at a few extra hours a week due to tighter timelines.",

Many times, questions students had were usually responded with \"read the writeup again\" (that was NOT clear at ALL, hence the flood of questions) or even in one case \"do not ask questions or you will get a honor code violation\". \n\nI was not active on the slack channel, but I can assure you that the professor never commented once in Piazza. I just did a search to be sure, and NOTHING showed up.

They connect very well to the lectures. \n\n3 projects (15% each). 6 home works (5% each). 1 final (25%). \n\nIt's a ton of work for the summer. It's a grind with something due every week. Even if you're ahead you'll get behind with the projects. You should definitely take ML before this. If not, you're in for a party. Highly recommend folks getting familiar with Barto and Sutton's book (it's free on Sutton's website), David Silver's RL lectures (YouTube), and numpy (vectorization for the win). \n\nHW 1-4, Project 1-2, and the final are fair and very related to the content (project 2 is awesome). HW 5-6 and Project 3 need to be reworked. HWs 5-6 are relatively easy, but are 'eh. ' Project 3 is a massive step up in complexity with little resources available if you don't 'get it. ' They were such an adrenaline kill after how great project 2 was. It sounds like the TAs are going to review and revamp. \n\nIsbell was absent, which was not a surprise due to past reviews. He was on piazza day 1, and that's essentially it. He missed the one office hour he was going to attend due to a storm. \n\nTAs were able to get Michael Littman on a special office hours, which was awesome. Last semester they got Richard Sutton. Littman is a genius, and it was an awesome experience. \n\nOne note, after reading some negative reviews, Michael Littman is a professor at Brown. He doesn't have access to GA Tech systems (Piazza). Fine to down vote the course for Isbell not showing up, but it's ignorant to down vote for a Browns prof not being active at GA Tech. \n\nTAs are knowledgeable. They will answer your questions. They sometimes need to review specifics (if referencing a paper). You will not find a better group of TAs.",

The videos, though high quality and well produced, seemed incomplete and poorly ordered. Video wise I learned much more from the freely available db classes on youtube (by stanford, peirce college, and houston clear lake). The exam questions were more tricky than than a test of knowledge (thus the difficulty rating). And no one in 2017 is going to need that much in depth knowledge about calculating index size. A unit on some of the new db trends (ie NoSQL), would have been time much better spent. Or maybe an actual case study of redesigning a problematic db application. \n\nThe class project is more about application programming than anything to do with db architecture and design. The db architecture and sql required were rudimentary imo. The programming, while not advanced, was extensive. Much larger than the db piece. Heaven help you if you get a bad team-- the group project will be a nightmare. Make sure everyone on your team has some level of programming experience. \n\nBEWARE the phase3 of the project. It's graded more about how you do the demo and programming than ANYTHING having to do with DB design and architecture. Even if your app is bullet proof be sure to conduct the demo in such a was as to go through the instructions ONE BY ONE calling out where your app meets the description. Don't count on the TA to ask you about anything you may have forgotten or been nervous and overlooked. \n\nAnd yes, as stated by the other reviewers, the class was tight and well run, the instructor (Jay) very attentive, knowledgeable, and responsive in piazza.",

The TAs were poorly organized and communication was extremely limited - there were so many unanswered, critical questions on Piazza. \n\nThe professor for the summer didn't even show up once. We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA's favorite saying was, \"I'm still waiting to hear back from the professor\". \n\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid. \n\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them. \n\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class.",

The assignments were painful in terms of having to work through incorrect or ambiguous instructions. In some projects then there would be a comment in Piazza that clarified something or corrected an error but that would be late into the project and in some cases meant repeating the project. It also meant that you had to spend a lot of time on Piazza, not just reading every post once but going back to see if an instructor had added a comment at a later date. I spent a lot of time re-working the projects which I feel was time wasted. For one of the projects it is still ambiguous as to why we had to do something a particular way and it has not been explained despite several attempts at asking. \n\nIn addition one project involving zmap Internet scanning resulted in many students being flagged by the IT department as performing unauthorized Internet scanning. This is something that should have been cleared with them in advance by the professor. It left students unable to complete the assignment, although they were given an alternative quiz afterwards it was very poorly handled. \n\nIn summary it is an interesting course and I did learn a lot from it, but the projects were very poorly handled in terms of incorrect instructions and ambiguities.",

It assumes you know undergrad networking knowledge (which i do not have) so there is a bit of learning curve\n\n2. Second project is difficult - You need to know algorithm for this. I did not know and got 60/130\n\n3. Lectures - My goodness this is the most difficult part. Content isn't bad but delivery needs improving\n\n4. TAs- My class TAs were amazing. held the courses together and responded fast and with respect. Kudos to Kelly Parks (head TA) and other TAs with her. \n\n5. Professor - Promised discussions for extra credit but didn't deliver. Gave 5% boost to everyone at the end but you could have just said you were going to do that from the beginning. Not sure why you had to make everyone anxious until the last week of the class\n\n6. Exams - Only multiple choice. Not sure why it was formatted like this. It was helpful to get your grades fast but I would have appreciated bit more free form answer discussion. I guess the classes were too big? not sure\n\nOverall not a bad course if you want to learn about networking. I do wonder what the opportunity cost is though. You should think about whether you REALLY want to learn networking or not. If you think this is a blow off class like it used to be, it's not. Prepare to put in 10-15 hours of work",

(You'll want to max out the points on homework to offset the inevitable point losses on the projects and final exam. )\n--The projects are interesting and challenging, with the second one being the best. \n\nCons:\n--No interaction at all with the professor\n--The style of the lectures isn't concise and sometimes sacrifices the content for entertainment. Tighter scripting would be helpful. (Many others, though, love the style. )\n--The oral presentations for the projects seem pointless. I never received any feedback on them, and they seemed to have no impact on my grades. \n--At least for the summer, there is a short window (less than a week) after finishing the last project to study for the final, which covers the whole semester. \n--Feedback isn't very detailed, and the specific point deductions for the projects and final exam are not revealed. \n--Just keeping up with the homework and projects can leave little time for reading the assigned papers",

            "text": "I'm pretty much echoing the other comments. This course is different than the typical OMSCS course (It was my 7th one, for basis of comparison). It is unstructured in the sense that there are not formal video lectures throughout [there are several introductory videos from Dr. Joyner on Udacity you'll watch in the first week, but that's it and even those are informal]. The rest of the course involves researching educational technology and proposing a project which you'll then complete while working with an assigned mentor. However, it is structured in the sense that you'll be guided through a series of objectives and milestones along the way. Discussion on Piazza plays a big part too... basically every day, there'll be some suggested topic to discuss or debate, although everyone is encouraged to ask questions, share articles or other interesting content they've found and just generally join in much as you would in a traditional seminar course. The TAs and Professor were extremely responsive and involved, but they also managed to stay out of the way and avoid micromanaging. The style of individual mentors varies as you'd expect but they make an attempt to match you up for a good fit and I had no problems working with mine. Finally, peer reviews are also included.... my impression of the utility of those was mixed. In all cases, various sorts of 'participation' are acknowledged and form part of your final grade. At the beginning, you'll probably wonder \"What have I go myself into ?\" but before long you'll find yourself fitting into the flow just fine. Your communication skills will definitely be exercised... there are weekly essays prior to actually beginning the project phase, milestone & progress reports, a final project video presentation, and a final project paper suitable for publication. Time management is also important, particularly in the compressed summer semester. Bottom line --- you'll get out of it what you put into it.",

Having a basic understanding of python, network\\programming basics, and android development. \n\nMy expectations for the class were to lean about network security and ways to prevent attacks or make it harder for attacks to happen.

It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them. \n\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted. \n\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors. \n\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class. He did not even post a single comment and was not involved in the class at all. \n\nThe TAs lead this class completely, with one TA standing way above all the rest. And he wasn’t even the head TA.",

The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry. \n\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project. \n\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material. \n\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course. This is a Computer Science Masters degree after all.

I probably watched 30% of the lectures but read all of the course slides and that turned out to be enough. The quizzes provided in the lectures are the worst I've ever seen. Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As. The lesson here is just do the work and start early on the projects. They are not extremely difficult but they do take time so don't underestimate them.

The second one did not involve any development, but was still interesting. The third was in Python, and the forth was in HTML / PHP / Javascript. I already took Networking and Network Security before taking this class, so the second half of the semester was pretty simple. \n\nThe quizzes aren't too bad, and were useful when studying for the exams. There is a good deal of reading, and the lectures are informative, but do not cover enough for the exams. I would recommend doing both the readings and the lectures.",

Quite frankly for people like me who have ML background, this is probably an easy one. There was nothing I couldn't understand in the lectures. The cutoff of \"A\" grade is >=78% (Summer 2017). This means so long as you got a full mark (not quite hard to achieve) in every assignment (accounts for 60% in Summer 2017) and don't bomb the midterm or final (accounts for 20% each), you're good. \nThe lectures will get you intrigued about major AI topics, but certainly won't make you some AI juggernaut. What on earth is AI anyway?\nOccasionally, you need to write your own unit test for the assignments. The XYZ_test. py files they provide weren't perfect - let's put it this way. \nTAs are trying their best to be helpful with their delightful sense of humor. In most cases I waited for 24-48 hours before a TA addresses a question I posted on Piazza. There were complaints about absence of TAs, so I'd suggest them hold daily mentoring sessions instead of just 3 times a week for summer terms (perhaps less frequent for spring/fall since it's less intense). People got frustrated by unclear expressions in the assignments and exams. \nUnlike other courses I've taken, the instructor was almost absent on Slack or Piazza.

However they give you no training in creating a UI. If you don't have people on your team who have done this sort of thing before you are in for trouble. In the demo that you are required to give at the end of the phase there is no proper rubric as to what and how you are required to demonstrate. No complete guidelines. They give you something called a demo guidelines for phase 3. Even if you have it all working according to those guidelines you will have points deducted because some column is not sorted by date by default. I think the project should only test you on what is taught in the class. Not on how well you create a UI that interacts with your database. That is completely outside the scope of what is taught. This is the part that makes it hard. Otherwise the instructor was quick to respond to many things in piazza. The main TA Will regularly took part in office hours. The other TAs are invisible.",

If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading. \n\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures. \n\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult. \n\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\n\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened. These discussion threads were to apply to a 5% extra credit score, which ended up being applied to everyone's grade since no threads were ever posted. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and I learned a lot, but it has flaws which I hope are resolved in the coming semesters.",

You're working in teams, though, and despite their pleas to the contrary, that means you're practically only going to get hands-on experience with some of this. \n\nThe exams, are - to me - a bummer. They account for 50% of the total grade. They are 25 questions each, which means your margin for error is slim. And aggravatingly, each contained one or two trick questions that were intended to catch you on some technicality or wording instead of testing your knowledge. I spent probably 20-25 hours studying for each and did not do well on one of them. I've been using SQL databases in my job for nearly 20 years, so this was a pretty befuddling result. \n\nIn all, I think the class is in the lower half of the pack for OMSCS.

Might be just me, but I felt like the test were trickier, basically not doing as well on the test as I thought I did when I took the test. Make sure you know C or have done some C programming before you take this class, there are MANY people who drop out during the first project just for this reason of thinking they will learn on the fly and are not able to keep up. From the perspective of someone with a undergrad CS degree (obviously this will vary based on your undergrad CS program rigor) everything up to about a little after mid term I already had familiarity with or forgot (Obviously the class went in greater depth of the topics I already covered in undergrad so I learn't new stuff here and there in the first half of the content). On the second part of the semester is where It covers virtualization and distributed systems, RPC and was where I really saw new content for me personally.

Essentially, there's the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they'll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it's very difficult to do so. You'll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it's not (unless you're already familiar with the math and robotics). \n\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you'll just have to go for it, however if you don't need it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester. Hopefully in the near future (like ASAP) they'll fix this course. \n\nTo end on a more positive note, if you don't take this course, I highly recommended doing the Udacity portion on your own.

I am also an amateur photographer and very comfortable with a DSLR camera. This course comes with a weekly assignment which is to be turned in every Monday leaving very little breathing space. As this was my first course, i had signed up for only one course and was able to spend atleast a day or two for the A&B (Above and Beyond) section. For many assignments (7-8 of them), lot of time is spent on research and report writing. The TAs shared some of the exemplary reports for each assignment and it was ridiculously amazing at the amount of work being put into them :)\n\nThe first 2-3 assignments are pretty simple and straight forward, though few of them requires setting up equipment (Camera Obscura), taking loads of pictures (Photos of space, feature matching) and few assignments have specific coding requirements (HDR). We get two weeks for the final project and the final exam is an open book multi choice test. \n\nOne of the best parts of this course is the auto grader for the coding parts of the assignment with Instant feedback and unlimited submissions. \n\nFrom discussions over slack, few had paired this course with another course based on the earlier reviews and faced difficulties due to the assignment schedule. \n\nCheck the Course Google group for insight into what kind of assignments were worked upon.

Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn't fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence. The TA's are extremely helpful and responsive, and other students were helpful too. I believe there was also an introduction to C office hour held at the beginning of the course (but I did not attend).",

The second project hadn't been assigned as mandatory before and it was not really ready to be released. There were a lot of issues with the descriptions and grading of that project. Hopefully it will be smoother in future semesters. The final project seemed impossible at first, but if you just experiment with things you have learned in this class (or other classes) you will find you can achieve decent results. So my two pieces of advice for the final project:\n1) Write a good script to test with. This will really help with #2\n2) Experiment with different approaches. Just try things. Overall I implemented 5 approaches and fine-tuned the best of those five. \n\nLectures: Not many lectures, only 6 but they were of good educational quality though some of the in lecture quizzes had a bit of disconnect from the instructions given in the \"intro\" video for the quiz. \n\nHomework: You have a homework set for each Lecture. The answers are given during the lecture so you should be able to get a perfect score here. (30% of your grade)\n\nProjects: As noted above the first was pretty straightforward. The second was pretty hard and a bit of a mess for our semester at least. The final project can be done in groups if you want, that might help with my advice above about trying different approaches. I went solo and got a good score.

I don't think that's exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O. On the other hand if you don't really know what an outer join, group by, etc. are, of course it will be hard to look for something you don't understand. \n\nCompleting the labs before the class started helped me a lot: http://www. sunlab. org/teaching/cse6250/spring2017/lab \nIn that way, I didn't waste time setting up the environment for each assignment (the labs are closely related with assignments 2, 3, and 4). \n\nAs other reviews as mentioned, you are mostly on your own on the 2nd part of the class, but I think the grading was very lenient.

Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+. \n\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn't find many of them useful in the real world. \n\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don't try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves. Another person do all of the diagrams, and another all of the writeup. Run your team like you would an interdisciplinary team at work. \n\nI gave 3 stars as I personally didn't learn much in this class, if you come in to OMSCS with a lot of coding experience its ok to skip this one and take something more challenging or interesting.",

You spend the first few weeks figuring out which areas you're interested in, and the remainder of the semester is spent putting your project together. Those first few weeks are very important as they will change the complexion of your experience in the course depending on what you choose. I worked on a team, and I think that is the best way to approach this class. You have other students that are holding you accountable and that are dependent upon you to get a good grade. You can do the project individually if you'd like (most people did, but I wanted a bigger project). It is also worth noting that you have one TA in this course - your mentor. So if you have any questions or want to know what to do to succeed, you have one person you can ask. In my opinion, this made it much easier because you're not getting conflicting information or trying to juggle multiple people's expectations. It is also much easier to get answers to your questions because one TA isn't trying to answer all of the questions - just their group of students' questions.",

You work through building out an application from the requirements stage -> initial individual implementation -> expansion of requirements -> expanded group implementation. This process is incredibly helpful as it presents things that you do in the real world. \n\nWhat I didn't like was the weight put on sticking to OOP principles throughout the process. While the instructors have to pick some sort of way of evaluating code, picking specific programming paradigms/features cause problems as it is outside the stated goals of project architecture/documentation/design/implementation. That said, if you have any sort of OOP background you should be OK in this course (another important piece of info is this course is very much a \"do your assignments in Java\" course). \n\nI got the feeling that this course is somewhat evolving and some of the lecture material isn't useful for the full implementation of the projects. Hoping that GaTech addresses this disparity going forward to make sure the assignments and lectures converge a bit better.",

Very little participation by Prof Isbell, but the TAs were incredibly enthusiastic, involved, and had considerable knowledge of the subject. \n\nThe videos are well done. They're a bit chatty though as I learned going back through them for the final trying to take notes. I liked the blend of theoretical and practical, but if math isn't your think, the theoretical part is pretty dense. \n\nThe workload is quite high in the summer. After the first week, there's a homework (6 of them), project (3), or test (the final) due every Monday. I. e., [hw, hw, project]*3 + final. There are probably 20+ hours of lectures and 20+ papers. I don't think anyone really read all the papers in depth and most fell behind on the videos. We were always struggling to keep up with graded assignments. The second project (lunar lander) also required reading unassigned material (almost everyone who was successful used DQN, which wasn't explicitly covered). You should aim to get the two homeworks done in a week and leave yourself two weeks for the project, if you're taking it in the summer. The extra weeks in a regular semester would make a very big difference in the pace. You could do one hw per week and have two weeks for the project. \n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the course a little less project-oriented and split the final into a mid-term plus a final. That would force folks to stay up with the material and keep it up from being a semester of projects followed by a week of cramming. You could remove a project or make them a little easier. For instance, I would provide the soccer environment for project 3 and maybe give hints on some hyperparameters for the lunar lander project -- aspects of the projects that don't really have pedagogical value. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot and feel like you accomplished something.",

I would highly recommend that you take this class during a full-length semester if possible. I wanted to spend more time appreciating the concepts I was learning/implementing... but because of the fast pace of the summer, was unable to do so.

You'll definitely need to do both to get through, the first time that's been true for me in 9 OMSCS courses. \nOther problems: \nWhen I pointed out that the TAs cancel office hours without notice I got a promise that it won't happen again -- and 0. 00 TA behavioral modification, which still strikes me as bizarre. \nRan into a nasty bug that prevented assignment completion and dropping the course. We reported it, but TAs never followed up, so the bug hasn't been corrected in the source library. I'm trying to find time to create a minimal, non-HW example and report it myself. \nWithout a test for every aspect of an assignment that the server tests for, there is a real risk that you won't find every nonconformity from (sometimes nebulous) desiderata in your code. Students should get different tests that nevertheless cover every test /type/, but evidently the professor has a, IMHO, misplaced fear that we're already so good at AI we can evolve a general solution from the tests.",

I will admit that I learned a good bit in this course about a wide variety of different topics. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to teach most of this to myself. This, in my mind, made the course very stressful because the skills needed to complete the projects were not taught in the course. There was a lot of \"here's the manual, here's a paper, learn this new technology, complete the project. \" Some of the project write-ups were downright terrible and did not include nearly enough information for someone inexperienced with that particular system to complete it on their own, certainly not within the given time frame. Thank goodness for Piazza. Wouldn't have been able to finish the class without it. \n\nAnother thing which really bugged me: each project had a separate VM, and NONE of them were ready to go out of the box. Each required re-configuring, setup, or installations which were time consuming and error prone. On more than one project I spent more time setting up the environment than I did completing actual work. \n\nFinal thoughts: don't take this in the summer, and brush up on Linux, Virtual Box, port scanning, Snort, and JavaScript first. Go in with the expectation that this is a self-taught course, and expect to spend a LOT of time on Piazza. Start projects as soon as they become available and set aside plenty of time to work on them each day.",

Instead, this lead to time-wasting, misplaced effort and lots of wheel-spinning. The second downside was that once the project was completed, there were no real discussions about how each student approached and solved the problems—hence you’re left with whatever understanding you had without any affirmation or new insight as to the different approaches taken. \n\nThe lead instructor (not Thrun) was barely involved and didn’t seem to be in touch with the class other than to chastise the class for possible violation of the honor code.

But then Dr. Starner was on sabbatical at Google all summer (working on Google Glass). So, our head instructor was one of Dr. Starner's Ph. D. students, and he hadn't been involved with an OMSCS course before. That led to some issues that I'd never experienced or heard of in other OMSCS courses. \n \nThe good news is that I learned a lot. The R&N textbook is good. There were 6 fun and instructive programming projects. Each had an autograder with a submission cap (e. g., 1/hr or 20 total). I averaged 20 hr/project and got to 100 on 5 of the 6 projects. On project 3 (Bayes Networks), I only got to 85 after 37 hours and 20 submissions. Thankfully, we got to drop our lowest project grade. \n \nThe videos were from three different people and had dramatically different quality. Thad Starner's videos were great - professional and easy to follow. Peter Norvig's videos were ok - made with home video but with good explanations. Sebastian Thrun's videos were terrible - made with home video and with awful explanations. Thrun's videos covered some of the hardest topics (e. g., Bayes Networks), so they were a big disappointment. \n \nThe midterm and final exams were take-home, and they were good learning tools. They made me dig into several areas deeper. Each exam required a lot of TA clarifications on Piazza, but the TAs graded the tests fairly trying to take all the clarifications into account. The TAs were cool about regrade requests too if you could justify why you needed one. \n \nI averaged 22 hours per week and had an A before the curve. My only prior Python use was in the CN course (CS 6250), so I didn't know Numpy. This course takes hard work, but I strongly recommend that you only take it during a full semester when Dr. Starner is available to manage the course.

You create one really useful diagram that makes you think, and a ton of expository writing that just fills pages. So, a lot like any highly regulated domain. This presumably forms the core of the class. \n\nHowever, in summer, you get the thrill of concurrent group and individual assignments. The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don't have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don't have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don't share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information. \n\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help. \n\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar.

The optional textbook helps with that for this course. \n\nRequired for the summer were problem sets on Udacity (30%), project 1 (20%), project 2 (20%), final project (30%). There were numerous extra credit opportunities, both actual EC and pseudo EC that would push you to a higher grade if you were on the boundary. \n\nUdacity has all the answers for the problem sets and it was expected that we would use them before submitting. That's 30% of our grade just given to us. \n\nProject 1 was the runaway robot project on Udacity. Although it appears at the end of the Udacity course, only the first 3 lessons were relevant. Part 5 of the project ended up being extra credit. The first 4 parts are doable with basic math and probability, but the point is to use what was learned in those first 3 lessons. \n\nProject 2 involved helping a robot find its way around a warehouse. Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn't use those test cases only has themselves to blame. Part C had so many kinks it ended up becoming EC. Part B was regraded when it was discovered some test cases didn't match the project specs. \n\nFinal project, hexbug location prediction, sounds irrelevant to the material covered in class. It's not. It's certainly doable with irrelevant items but many successful projects used techniques (or extensions) from class. Using extensions of techniques learned in class is reasonable for a grad-level course in a top-tier school. \n\nTAs were great and helpful. Pryby as well, more so than others here suggest.",

I thought this course was not hard even though it was offered in the summer for the first time. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are not difficult to comprehend. I found the readings easy to understand due to how the amazing job the writers did. I made an effort to read all suggested chapters after watching the lectures. This will definitely help you to succeed in both the assignments and the exam. \n\nAssignments: Start early studying the requirements for these. Identify which part of the material you will need to solve them. However, don't start coding right away, the instructors were still making some modifications after the release date. Always prioritize coding efficiently. All assignments can be completed with runtimes less than 30 seconds. This will help you perform tests and modify your code faster. If your code is taking longer than that go back and try to find where it can be improved. \n\nExams: There were a midterm and a final both take home exams. Make sure you are caught up with the material (or at least most of it) before taking them. The questions are not hard and instructors were always there to clarify any possible ambiguity. They were also lenient with some questions when several students had a different interpretation of the problem statements. NOTE: Submit your pdf with what you did to get to the answer. They will give you partial credit if you got the answer wrong but your thought process was correct. \n\nStaff: In my opinion, the TAs did great. In spite of being the first summer offer, they handled the challenge well and were able to solve most issues. There were some problems with the final grading but my impression is that they eventually got resolved. \n\nI managed to get a 96% before the curve. They use the median to determine your letter grade: A = if you are above min(90%, median(final grades)).",

Everything that I've learned has been through self-learning, which 1) is not a very efficient way to learn a large amount of new material as I find myself constantly reinventing the wheel and 2) I can do this for free on my own time, focusing on exactly what I'm interested in. The assignments do force you to learn new technologies and techniques, but I'm sure that I could have learned a lot more in a lot less time if there was guidance. \n\nI don't have a specific interest in data science, but in general I can't imagine myself liking any course where there's no meaningful instruction and instead we're given time-consuming (40+ hour) homeworks to hack away at using whatever resources we can find. The amount of work required for the amount I was learning was too great and in all likelihood none of this will ever be useful to me professionally so I cut my losses and dropped. If you actually work in this area or want to work in this area, the course might be worth it since it forces you to use a lot of different technologies, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nYou'll learn a lot in this class like the other reviews state, but it's because you'll spend almost as much time on it as you do at your full time job, not because it's actually a good class.

Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this.

Unfortunately, its a poor reflection of the OMSCS program and hopefully the feedback on OMSCentral will be used to improve the course.\n\nThere is almost no interaction between the instructors/TA and students on Piazza -- it was the least amount of Piazza/Slack activity I've observed so far in this program. There's pretty much nothing due for the first 4 weeks, then there's an extremely simple project that is made difficult through lack of clarity. After that, there's nothing due for a few more weeks until the Midterm that contains less than 20 multiple choice questions and is worth 25% of your grade. There is no direction on what to study, because the assessments are meant test the student's broad understand. This has the side effect of questions that are vague and open for interpretation, allowing multiple technically correct answers to some questions based on the level of abstraction of your interpretation. The books are just a really general overview of the topic. This course takes only a few hours of work per week to complete in its current state, and when the appropriate amount of effort is put forth, it will give you a 50% chance at a B, and 50% chance at an A. \n\nThe instructor is likable and he does a good job with the lectures, so that is one benefit. The instructor is knowledgeable in his field, just as you'd expect from a GA Tech professor.\n\nThis review isnt in retaliation for a bad grade, or a personal attack on any of the instructors; I received an A, and the instructors were willing to help a student when contacted. My theory is that outside of the lectures, the course was developed and operated by TAs from the brick and mortar program who just don't have much stake in the online program. I'd love to see this course improved upon.",

This may be one of the better \"easy\" electives to take in the OMSCS program, but it's definitely not one of the best courses in the program. \n\nThe lectures are shallow, fast paced, incomplete, and often a waste of time. The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is. \n\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to \"hack together\" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations. \n\nThis class is a shotgun scattershot of topics with poor instruction. The professor isn't engaged at all. The projects aren't hard, just frustrating and annoyingly time consuming for trivial things. If you'd really like to understand netsec, take 6035 and read Hackers' Playbook, Web App Hackers' Handbook, and Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Don't pay tuition for this course.",

            "text": "The fact that I hated this course isn't a reflection on the professor (Dr. Vigoda) or TAs. They did an amazing job and were very active, I just hate theoretical math. This is a very hard class. If you are like me and 1) were not good in math theory and 2) have not done this sort of thing since college, then this will probably be really hard. I would recommend doing all the homework problems, and all the problems related to the material in the text book. When you are done with those, find another text book and do all the problems there. Practice is the only way you are going to pass, unless you are just really good at this sort of thing.\n\nThere is a project but it isn't worth too much, though it took me a long time to complete. The homework problems are more or less meaningless for your grade, but very important if you want to learn the material. The exams are all closed book. You get partial credit, but that means you made smaller mistake, and you still lose a very large portion, so you really need to know the material. To be fair to Dr. Vigoda, he tells you what he expects you to know to pass, and he holds you to that. Grading is very quick on exams for the amount of students and the content in them. Office hours are very good too, and I had to watch almost all of them to get at least some grasp of the materials.\n\nI would recommend taking this class early, but not before you get some study habits down. It took me 15 PTO days, and studying almost every night to get down most of this material. If I took this when I first started OMSCS (I have 24 credits as it stands) then I would have not been able to adjust to the workload and the amount of effort needed to pass. Also, it is probably going to suck. Many students did not do well on one or more exams (myself included), and though you will see the stereotypical \"look at how smart I am!\" tech students in piazza, remember that others are struggling as much as you are. Don't drop too early, so that you at least get some of the material down, and plow through it. ",

While there are mostly no formal proofs involved (although you will have to give informal proofs), there is still a ton of material and concepts. The math isn't terrible, and everything you forgot is re-hashed by Dr. Vigoda so you can get back up to speed (although for graphs you will want to do a refresher on your own; otherwise this isnt needed). \n\nTo prep: I suggest going to the course website https://8803ga. wordpress. com/ and watching at least the first 2/3 of the lectures (the professor links to the videos on this page). I'd particularly suggest, at a minimum, getting re-acquainted with asymptotic notation and the basics of graphs (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and basic graph terms are either lightly covered or not covered, depending, but you will need to know them),  \n\nThe class is do-able, but be willing to prep OR be willing to spend 40 hour weeks on the course. If you are already comfortable with asymptotic notation and graph theory, Dynamic Programming (DP) and NP-Complete (NP) will take you the most amount of time, so if you have a good handle on those going in it will make life far easier. I would suggest being able to at least hold a light conversation in all of these topics; with no exposure to these, 80-100 hours spent on them before the class will surely pay off. ",

Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can't really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn't learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't. \n\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You *are* allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn't one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with.",

Six of that was initially setting up the development environment (mostly because I had a new and unfamiliar hardware setup), 70 on the projects, 23 on Piazza, Slack, etc., and 26 hours watching video lectures. (I log my hours with Toggl. ) It turns out that I have a pretty good background for the coursework we've done so far (concurrency and IPC mechanisms). The next 5 weeks may prove to be a bit harder for me. \n\nThe TAs have been *very* engaged, and there's a lot of healthy discussion on Piazza and the OMSCS6200. slack. com channel, which has been fun. (That explains why I've spent 23 hours on it. ) The prof (Dr. Ada Gavrilovska Habl) has been very fair, and is an excellent lecturer. This is my first semester, so I don't have a basis for comparison, but I'm very pleased with this course, and I recommend it. \n\nProjects are individual and have been well-designed. Development is in C, which is entirely appropriate for an OS course. If you only know a scripting language such as JavaScript, R, or Python, you might want to hit the first project hard, right away, to climb that learning curve.",

Very responsive and understanding, and he always seems to be trying to improve the class. The lectures were expertly done and mostly enjoyable, and the content is useful and interesting. \n\nHowever, for some reason I just did not enjoy the class overall. I believe the main reason was the assignments. I had to force myself to do almost every one because I always felt like the assignments did not improve my understanding of the topics from the lectures - they were just \"busy work\" to me. I gained a good understanding of the course material after watching the lectures but I found myself spending hours trying to brainstorm ideas to apply that material to the essay-style questions that make up the assignments. In other words, I spent more time trying to come up with interfaces to write about than time learning the material. My feelings towards this might stem from the fact that I am a coder at heart and there were not any assignments that leveraged that. \n\nIn summary, if you don't mind doing a lot of brainstorming about different interfaces and writing about redesigns for them, then this class is great. If you decide to skip out on this course, at least bookmark the lectures and watch them in your free time - they are definitely worth it.",

It was tough material for me to grasp, and I needed a better game plan than what I've done for other classes.\nAfter retaking it this spring, I wound up with an A. Here's how:\nSo this spring when I took the class, I went in knowing that I needed to work on this class every day. So for the first month or so, I did at least 1 dynamic programming problem a day. And not just the ones they recommend - I did all of the ones in the DPV text, all of the ones in the Kleinberg-Tardos text. I also watched Erik Demaine's lectures on dynamic programming. This is all in addition to the every day requirements of this class (the homework and lectures, etc). For dynamic programming - draw the damn table on your scratch paper. Every time...draw the table! When we got around to the NP Complete problems I did the same thing - at least one problem a day. The other topics were tough as well, but these 2 topics are the most crucial to passing this course.\nAnything he says in the lecture is a 'key idea' or 'key concept' is going to show up on a test. Even if you think, how could they possibly test that? Trust me, it'll be on the exam.\nAlso, watch the office hours.\nThere's a project (they choose a different project each semester), but it is not difficult and only worth 10% of the grade. The tests are the bulk of the grade (85%).",

The textbook used was \"Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach, 3rd edition\". The course covers almost the entire textbook. This is a great course that gives an overview of all AI/ML techniques. Even though it covers such a wide breadth of topics, the course does fair amount of justice to them. All the topics are covered in a depth that you can get a fairly good idea about the topics. The knowledge you will gain in this course will not be shallow as is usually feared from courses that have a very wide course. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, I found the course to be fairly difficult. That is also given the fact that I did not have prior AI/ML experience. The assignments make us code various AI/ML algos from scratch with helps in a deeper understanding. Assignments will take time if your situation is like I had. Assignments are in python and good understanding of numpy can help. \n\nExams are open book and pretty tough but fun nonetheless. \n\nTA interactions are great. In my time we had at least 2 great TAs who were always active on slack. You might find lectures a bit too shallow but textbook and additional readings make up for that. \n\nIMO this course is a must if you dont have a prior AI/ML experience and want to pursue ML specialization.",

I used to do a lot more backend work, and this class has given me some better background info on some of the projects I was working on. \n\nThe projects are a split between programming interview / competition style Python algorithms, and lab reports based on experiments conducted using a simulated network. The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects. Piazza can be hit or miss, since there's a TON of threads, and it's hard to find important imformation even when threads are pinned. \n\nSummary: Recommended. If you're a solid programmer, this is a good first course to take.",

Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don't tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it's reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can't do those things we'll never be able to discover or invent something new. \n\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you'll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries. \n\nThis course isn't about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester).

The auto-grader (affectionately known as \"Bonnie\") helped to provide some feedback that was useful with the coding assignment. I think this course was considered one of the easier or less-difficult courses in the past but they adapted the course this Fall term. I'm not sure how difficult it was earlier but I personally feel this course is no joke. Some of the assignments in the middle of the semester caught me off guard and I found myself pulling all-nighters in some cases to get the project done. For me the Blending assignment, while very interesting, was the most difficult. The first two assignments were really good at getting the introductions to the material but about the 3rd project it got real, really fast. If you have some Python experience, an interest in photography, some level of Linear Algebra I would highly recommend this course. As a prerequisite recommendation, I would suggest getting accustomed to Numpy, you'll be using this in nearly every coding project. Also check out some OpenCV tutorials. Otherwise, enjoy computing with pictures. I rated the workload as 20 hours per week largely because of the Above and Beyond portions of the projects. This is a really good approach for a graduate level course, it allows you to dive as deep as you want on the material and there are so many cool things to explore here. I also appreciated how we had 2 weeks per project to enable getting into the material more (than having a single week for a project).

At this moment, we have been waiting for answers for questions for the assignment due this week (November 8, 2017), and it is 3 days and we haven't received answers. But guess what! Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures. So, the only reason I am taking it is because it is one of the options as requirements. The other course is 'Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity', thus, either you take SDP or you take CAC. \n\nThe schedule for assignments due? The worst! They are due every Friday night; Saturday morning for some people. I wonder why they do that, when other courses assignments are due on Sundays. It looks like the people leading this course do not have a sense of humanity. They do not care if you have a family or if you are in another course: assignments are due every week on Friday!",

One frustrating series of lectures was on live ranges and webs. Resources around the internet on these topics sometimes consider them equal, and sometimes don't. This part of the lectures seemed to gloss over how they're actually built, which was problematic, since one of the projects was centered around them. \n\nSpeaking of projects, they were useful, and it was cool to implement some of the algorithms/processes used in the various compiler phases. Grading seemed to be very generous; I got full marks on both projects. I'm not sure how they were graded or how many different types of inputs were thrown at them. There was a partner option for the projects, which I reluctantly took advantage of for the second project. Just a heads up in case you're anti-group project like me. \n\nThe exam was tough but fair.

I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size.",

I registered this course after reading the on campus syllabus (My bad), when I saw the OMS syllabus, it was too late to withdraw and waitlist another course, so I decide to take it. The on campus version included all modern technologies SQL, Tableau, D3, Hadoop, Azure, Hbase, Pagerank etc.. But the OMS version is basically week 1-6: intro to R and ggplot in R; week 7 till end: regressions in R. The syllabus speaks for itself, a more appropriate name should be \"intro to regression with R\" or \"the linear regression half of stat 101\". These knowledge might be useful 10 years ago when everything was analyzed in memory, but now... I'm almost to the end of this semester, I've completed most of the homework/project in slow Friday afternoons at work without watching the videos. I have a statistical background, but to be honest, the course (homework) covered nothing more than linear regression, I assume most of us coming to the program should have some knowledge of linear regression. \n\n The only scenarios I think you should take this class:\n 1. you need a low involvement course: eg. you are paring it with an intensive 30+ hour course.  \n 2. (more important) if you are in the Machine Learning specialization, you have to chose 3 electives from the 4 courses offered. If you have one course you don't want (eg. BD4H), you'll have to take all the rest of the 3. ",

I used the international edition of the book which is less expensive, but sacrifices the on-line material and some additional chapters which would have been helpful in a couple cases.

I also liked the fact that the professor provided supplementary videos that guided the students on how to tackle projects.  A big portion of this course is getting familiar with numpy and pandas.  Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market.  A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions.  For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results.  I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students.  My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.  For example, you could lose 10-20 points for forgetting to put your name.  Staying active on slack is very helpful, because people will often point out important points in the directions that you might miss.\n\nUnfortunately, you will most likely not learn enough from this class alone to apply machine learning strategies in real life situations, but the class will give you a strong foundation if you are interested in exploring that field.

There's a lot of good in the course but it currently suffers from poor execution and a lack of communication making the course way more stressful than it needs to be.\n\n\nThe lecture material is good, the assignments themselves are relevant and have the right level of challenge. Unfortunately most of the assignments were not released when they were expected to be. Assignments would be released in \"beta\" form a few days or even a week after we were expected to start them. and then sometimes not \"finalized\" until a few days before the assignment was due. This is troublesome because some of these assignments do need the full allotted time to work on them, and if you waited until an assignment was \"finalized\" you would pretty much guarantee that you don't have enough time to finish the assignment. This wouldn't be as bad if it were minor tweaks being made, but the \"beta\" version was typically just the previous semesters assignment and there was no clear communication on what changed with each iteration of the assignment so you are left analyzing every line of the assignment over and over to make sure you don't miss some gotcha that could cause you to lose substantial points.\n\n\nThis is my 9th OMSCS course and this course in its current form isn't very friendly to OMSCS students who typically have full-time jobs and other responsibilities outside of school. In addition to the above issues, assignments also were not open for submission until a day or two before the due date in many cases. So even if you had worked ahead, you  still would need to plan around having an internet connection and submitting your assignment the day it was due. There were also random participation checks on the forums, punishing students who didn't check every day. In general it is structured in a way that prevented students planning around their life, and instead they must plan their life around the course. Most OMSCS courses I've taken have been more flexible in this regard. Students who suggested changes to the course to improve it were met with snarky comments from the professor on the forums.   \n\n\nIn general I can't recommend the course in its current form unless your willing to deal with the above headaches.

After the first month or so it the content did branch away from Info Sec. This class is structured very similarly to Info Sec. Mainly project based. Final exam. Quizzes. I found the projects to be pretty easy (usually finished them in a day) but very insightful. I enjoyed learning from the projects. The lectures were harder to learn from. Just like Info Sec the professor tries to teach too much in every video - makes it hard to focus. Plus, I never found a connection between the videos and the projects. The quizzes and videos quickly begin to feel like busy work. I think this class would be better if it had one more project and dropped either the final exam or the quizzes. During the semester I took the class we had a month for the last project. So this would be a good class to pair with another class that has a lot of work towards the end of the semester. I also wish the TAs would have graded things with a little more care. I had to submit regrade requests for every project. Also, the project's instructions were really hard to follow sometimes.\n\nOverall, a good class if you are new to security. Probably easier if you take Info Sec first. ",

            "text": "I liked the course overall but definitely think it has more potential than what's actually being done. I rated it medium because really most of the projects took me around 6 hours to complete. Which I really don't think is bad. There were really only two projects that took around 8-10 hours to complete so in the end I rated it medium because most of the projects were. On average with assignments and lectures (plus the occasional reading), I would say it took me around 12 hours a week. That's on the high side again given that homework is due usually every other week. That being said here's the review. The course is really split into two sections. The front half is a lot of stock and market information with hands on Python assignments to supplement the learning. The latter half of the course is more machine learning in conjunction with Python and stock and finances. You don't need to be an experience python user to take this course. Though I did have experience using the Python libraries and Python is a language I program in every day so it will certainly help. Also, you don't have to be a stock expert. The lectures are straightforward an well laid out in nice manageable chunks. In fact most were 1 hour lectures I could easily do during my lunch if I wanted. The profession is very knowledgeable, funny, and a good presenter; you'll enjoy watching the lectures. This class really glances over a few machine learning algorithms and you'll program a few but I wouldn't say it's a full deep dive into Machine Learning. In fact it's really about using algorithms to trade stocks and manage portfolios. This of course makes it solid intro class. There were of course some drawbacks. Communications throughout the semester was terrible. Reddit was used instead of Piazza for this semester which I think threw a lot of non-reddit users through a loop. I happen to use it often but it made the threads really noisy and messy with people asking numerous redundant questions and not putting comments in the right threads. Additionally, communication from the professor was far and few between. Assignment \"updates\" or comments about questions in the reddit threads (which could easily grow in the few thousands) were fair game for requirements on assignments (even if not listed on the rubric). Assignments were hardly finalized until a 3-5 days before their due date and portals to submit were often times opened days before they were actually due. My TA was impossible to get ahold of throughout the semester. The assignments tended to have subtle but time consuming changes that needed to happen each week (one week give the output in this dataframe and the next is needs to be a series or another datatype). This wouldn't be bad overall if two things happened. 1. There was a blip or sample of what the output should look like. 2. Each week you weren't forced to retool your other classes and functions to accommodate the returns to be some new data type for the input of a new function. Overall, the factors above speak for themselves. I found the course engaging and entertaining enough to give it a Liked, I didn't spend forever on it each week, and it was fairly average difficulty wise.",

            "text": "Precursor: this course was without a doubt made more difficult (welcome to the OMSCS!). I've compared it with students who took it on-campus a couple years ago and there's a staggering difference.\n2 closed book exams, rather than 1 open-note midterm.\nOptional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\n\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn't know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\n\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force. Don't underestimate some of the assignments. Start early or learn regret the hard way.\n\nThe workload is medium. Probably just the right amount of class-work for someone employed full-time. Sometimes I would have to devote all of Saturday or my entire weekend to the class.\n\nThe professor has nice lectures, but the reddit format was painful despite being a \"redditor\". Join a discussion late, and your comments will go buried. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that the class isn't the most flexible around the online student's time. You have to make sacrifices to accommodate the class's flimsical finalization of assignments, with short deadlines.\n\nIf I were to go back in time, I'd still take the class again.",

I had a strong non-Python programming background as well as an intro Python class and I  found the class pretty easy. However, people with less experience found it had a very steep learning curve and could be very difficult.\n\nAssignments are released weekly but you have two weeks to do them. The first programming exam was timed (2 hours), but after feedback from students they decided to change it to a 24 hour exam that must be completed within a 7-day window. I found the exam still only took me 2-3 hours to complete. The final was also 24 hours in 7 days, so they will likely keep that format going forward. \n\nAssignments and exams are in Jupyter notebooks that walk you though the exercises. Lectures correspond to most of the notebooks, but if you're a quick learner you can get almost all the material just from the notebook. Instead of writing the entire large program, the notebook includes some code written by the instructors and you write code to fill in the blanks.\n\nOverall, I found it pretty easy, and it paired well with ISYE 6501 (Intro Analytics). The instructors had some trouble with getting assignments up on time, class organization, and responding to Piazza in a timely manner, but I think most of that had to do with the fact it was the first semester the course was offered online.\n\nMy one course content complaint would be that the end of the course, which seemed like the whole point/the culmination of the course, was extremely rushed at the end (3 shorter assignments due within 2 days of each other). I wish less time had been spent on the Python basics at the beginning and more time was spent on that actual analytical modeling methods.",

That said, it is worth having some programming background and taking an R intro course before starting the class since there is a very steep learning curve. Lecture videos were interesting and easy to follow. The course project, despite being a fairly large portion of the grade, does not take a ton of time to complete. Peer grading could be a struggle since the grading standards are fairly open-ended. The exams are multiple choice and matching, but are actually quite tricky. None of the concepts are overly difficult to comprehend, but the question phrasing and deeper connections make the exams more challenging than you would expect.

I fail to see how they can be any use once you move outside of academia. Second half teaches you tools that may actually be useful, but less than 50% good does not make up for the horrid 50%.\nAssignments: Extremely frustrating. Some assignments are extremely easy while the some are very difficult, not because you learn some difficult yet interesting concept, but because they are designed to be - otherwise all the assignments will take only a few hours to complete. Most assignments are auto-graded, so if you have typos in your typed answer don't expect any leniency. There's no Slack chat for the class - again if one existed the assignments would have been super easy. Some can be completed by \"throwing random inputs at the wall and see what sticks\", which is actually a valid testing framework, according to some lecture.\nLectures: Difficult concepts are skimped, while lecturer spends a lot of time explaining obvious, common-sense concepts. Lectures are mostly disconnected with assignments. Expect maybe 10 minutes of useful materials and 30 minutes of filler contents, and unlike ESPN the filler contents can give you a coma. Examples are not adequate so the office hours are mandatory if you want to understand what's going on, which you really don't since....\nExams: Completely different from the samples and the lectures. I mean, seriously, if I didn't study Statistics in college (yes, statistics) I would have easily lost 25% on the exams. Esoteric concepts from lectures were drilled, so you have to really think outside of the box. It's excellent to get students to drop the class and apparently so, since piazza traffics pretty went quiet the weeks after the midterm.\nTAs and Professor: The Professor did not show up at all so we can safely disregard him. TAs work really hard answering questions and maintaining conversation but harder not revealing solutions. I feel sorry for them, since their hands are tied. The way assignments are simply prevent them from having a meaningful conversation about the concepts. Sometimes by explaining things in a non-revealing way they ended up confusing people. \n\nSave your time and $800+ and take another class. ",

The reason being that the content, assignments and projects introduces a lot of different fields - network sockets, controls (primarily open vs closed loop with single and multi-variable feedback), system modeling, embedded programming and architecture design & analysis among other CPS topics. The course can be coupled with SDP course and I think the two together shall provide a strong fundamental mechanisms required for other OMSCS courses. \n\nI found the Udacity lectures to be very good but with lot of information. It is a good thing! I took lot of hand-written notes as I went through the lectures and that was helpful to enforce the concepts/theory/case studies. The assignments were primarily hands-on, i.e. programming in C or Python. Starter codes were provided for all assignments/projects and the tasks themselves don't require a lot of programming but it requires understanding of how the starter code works. Understanding involves ability to read the provided code and also run experiments with the code. This might require exploring some external resources especially in C or Python in case you have minimal experience. The instructors are very helpful and held a weekly Q&A session (Saturday), though not many students participated to take advantage of the instructors availability. Beyond that any additional information required for the tasks has to be researched just like in any graduate course.\n\nThe course towards the end introduces AADL (a model based language) for a project but the time frame to learn AADL was short and coupled with the project deliverable which made the project more challenging. But challenges are fun, right? I found this to be one of the best part of the course. It would have been nice if at least the last two projects were based on AADL as that would give ample time to learn the language and related simulation tool and also be able to focus on the required project tasks properly.\n\nIf you are interested to know about - systems at large, embedded systems, real-time systems and controls, robotics, quadcopters (lot of examples based on this) and architecture development, then take this course. It is a good introduction from both computer science and CPS perspective.",

I appreciated the weekly YouTube office hours and was not required to post a mindless forum thread on a weekly basis, in contrast to my undergrad experience. The weekly workload is entirely doable if you read the instructions CAREFULLY and IGNORE your classmates' forum posts until you've absolutely hit a wall and need an answer to something in particular. Using this strategy, even while working 50 hour weeks I devoted about 4 days out of the week to schoolwork (this 1 class) and managed to get no less than a 94% on each assignment, I consider myself a software developer newbie with average intelligence. My favorite part of the course was the group project which we split up equally on documentation and coding, and I could not have asked for a better team. Having said all that, the TAs do take their sweet time on grading assignments, apparently especially if you choose to contest a grade (I did not), and I rarely saw any interaction by other TAs on the forum besides the two heads (perhaps they were grading?). There are some concepts that I would have liked to go deeper on, such as Agile, and the lectures could be updated with lessons on the currently used software.

            "text": "DISCLAIMERS:\nThis was my first course in the program, so I spent a fair amount of time early in the semester learning basic OMSCS infrastructure (Udacity, Piazza, T-Square, slack). Related, although I have experience as a software engineer, my current job is entirely different. So I also spent a good chuck of time creating a workable setup on my machine (Cygwin, .bashrc aliases, git). Finally, although Java is clearly stated as a prerequisite, my closest experience is C++ from 15 years ago. So coming up to speed there was nontrivial.\n\nPROS:\nProfessor Orso is a ton of fun! The lectures are great and the office hours are helpful. I enjoyed the material and appreciated the weekly assignment cadence. This course has been refined over many iterations, and the instructors are very clear that the decision to make each assignment due on Saturday morning is a deliberate one. Initially I was unhappy about this, but came to rather enjoy it by using some weekend time to get ahead on the homework rather than scrambling to meet the deadline. We were exposed to several technologies and tools (git, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Java, JUnit, markdown, XML). The Android Studio group project was a lot of fun. Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great! \n\nCONS:\nAssignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn't skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it's also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade. (Otherwise, there's no difference between OMSCS and watching Lynda videos!) I felt the lack of timely feedback hampered my learning and caused unnecessary anxiety.",

Even though there was a disconnect between the RPM projects and the course contents, the 3 RPM projects itself was very interesting and thought provoking. There is a Alt project after the first mandatory RPM project that deals with chat bot which I believe is more relevant than RPMs. Expect lots of writing in this class. I struggled with the writing assignments in the beginning but managed through later as I adjusted to the rhythm. In all there are 3 writing assignments, 3 projects with the project reflection associated with them, a mid term and a final exam. If you hate writing, this class may not be for you. Projects can use Python or Java. I would recommend brushing up your Python skills, especially Pillow and numpy for RPMs and NLTK for chat bot. This is a great first course to take and will set you up for the rest of your OMSCS journey. Good Luck!!!",

            "text": "Background knowledge:  Do not be fooled by the supposed required background knowledge.  They said we needed to be \"familiar\" with \"a high level programming language like Java or C++).  For your own health and safety, do not attempt this class without a very solid foundation in BOTH Java and C++, and experience in C and Bash scripting would definitely help to have in advance.  I went in not knowing C++ and we ended up having an assignment written in that language with a special framework that I got a 30 on because I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out the language and the corresponding special framework that I barely got around to actually figuring out the concept behind the assignment.  Don't make my mistakes.\n\nClass material:  There were definitely some interesting and useful concepts sprinkled in, but I work in this field and had never heard of most of the concepts/testing techniques in this class.  Either my company is just really terrible at testing, or a lot of these techniques are outdated, far too specific, or not used in the actual business world, and I think it's the latter.  There was some material that was very useful, but many of the lectures were incredibly boring and slow-moving.  Lots of time was spent on background and not as much on the actual concepts.\n\nAssignments:  This is what killed the class for me.  Assignments were either ridiculously easy (an hour or two) or impossibly difficult (30+ hours, and the majority were like this).  There were 7 total and I came to dread each release of a new assignment.  For me, they felt like an enormous leap from the lectures and I felt completely lost for the first third of the time spent on the tough ones.  Provided resources were extremely limited and lacked detail, and the concepts nearly always couldn't be found anywhere on the web, so I had to rely on asking the other students and TAs on Piazza for everything I couldn't understand, which was frustrating.  Overall the assignments tested our ability to figure out what we are supposed to do with the tiniest scraps of information as possible rather than our understanding of the concepts from class, so they felt like a huge and infuriating waste of time.\n\nExams:  The midterm was tough but I felt it was pretty fair.  We were given a practice exam for both the midterm and final and I felt the practice gave a good feel for what the real exam is like.  The class average was a 65 on the midterm, but the grades were curved soon afterwards.  The exams are open-lecture notes.  \n\nProfessors/TAs:  One of our professors was very dedicated, consistent with office hours, and was always on Piazza helping out and answering questions.  The other professor who recorded the lectures showed up for one office hours, which were supposed to be weekly, and then cancelled each week after that before finally not scheduling them at all and being replaced by rotating TAs.  The TAs were helpful and seemed dedicated to helping the students, and they seem like they had to carry a lot of the weight, so I commend them for that.\n\nThis was my first class in the entire program and it had me questioning whether the program was right for me.  I am hoping I will have a better experience in other classes.  Overall, I can't necessarily recommend the class but if you are better prepared (see section 1 of my review) you will probably suffer much less than I did.",

There were 5 projects, a midterm, and a final. The lectures felt very fast-paced and covered a broad subject at a shallow level, so it was hard to actually learn much from them. I agree with another student that the projects were somewhat disconnected from the lectures. Some of the projects even felt like they really belonged in Info Sec - as if the professor didn't accomplish everything he wanted to in that class, so he's using Network Security as a place to put the overflow. The professor's involvement in the class was minimal - I was active a few times in Slack, and often on Piazza, but I never saw any activity from Prof. Lee in either place, which is disappointing. The class was instead run (somewhat haphazardly) by TAs. The quizzes were poorly or ambiguously worded, sometimes such that there was more than one technically correct answer. Project writeups were often filled with errors or inconsistencies, which had to be resolved on Piazza, and unfortunately made the projects a bit harder to tackle since it was hard to distinguish parts you didn't understand from parts that were just wrong. Project skeleton code had typos that made one wonder if the TAs had actually tried to run the code before publishing it. The autograders were also poorly written, and many students (myself included) had to request regrades for one or more projects due to autograder issues.  Overall, could be a good class with interesting material, but feels poorly executed.",

            "text": "The content of this course is really interesting, though it feels to me like too much for one course - 30 hours of dense lecture videos exceed any class I've taken so far. The six projects had two week windows (plus a 3 week final project) and typically required tremendous effort, an average of 40 to 50 hours, and a peak of 70 hours for me. They mostly started off pretty cool - the coding was fun, the outputs were impressive - but typically had was too many parts, such that by the end the joy was sucked out of them. PS2 about sign detection was particularly atrocious in this regard. It just had way too much packed in. A notable exception was PS3 on augmented reality, which had a more reasonable workload (~30 hours), which allowed it to be strictly fun. It's my understanding that they redid a bunch of the projects this semester and it sounds like they got harder. This also meant there were frequent bugs in provided code, though I'd imagine this will be less of an issue going forward if they keep the same projects. In my opinion this course would be better off either split into two courses or with a little less depth; I was just so fatigued by the end that I really didn't enjoy it, even though the content is fascinating.\n\nI am surprised by the recent review which commends the instructional staff - this course has objectively the worst instructor interaction of any of six courses I've taken thus far. For example, there are a combined 320 unanswered questions or unresolved followups on Piazza, roughly 10x the next worst class I've taken by this metric. The ratio of instructor responses to student responses is 0.642 - I've rarely (never?) had a class below 1.0. There were commonly bugs in project code that would be caught by students, and the instructors would not post updates or even make conspicuous announcements about the errors to save hours of pointless frustration for students on already tremendous projects. The one glaring exception to this trend were TA Matt Houston's office hours, which were excellent. The actual instructor, Dr. Essa, was completely absent - no office hours, no Piazza, etc. In fact, one of just two times he ever showed up on Piazza was to attack some students who implied that he was absent!\n\n\n\n\n",

Let's start from the top: a class called \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\" should, at some point, mention \"Analytics\" somewhere. They didn't even try to connect it with the subject that 100% of its students came to study.\n\nInstead, this is a hodge-podge of (way, way too many) business concepts crammed together, taught with no connection to one another in four batches by four professors. The first lecturer, teaching business accounting, was absolutely atrocious. He clearly was just winging his way through his lectures, rambling with maybe a loose outline in front of him. Editing the transcripts into some semblance of a coherent study tool, it was possible to edit out 40-70% of the text without any loss of information, so redundant and bloated was the text. The second lecturer was marginally better, but his handwriting in the few problems we were given as examples was atrocious, and he would throw out acronyms without explanation.\n\nThere were far too few checks for understanding and practice problems, and then the homework and exams were brutally unforgiving. Accounting problems that would take 10-20 minutes to complete would have single, graded all-or-nothing multiple-choice submissions (and sometimes, fill-in-the-blank, better-get-it-exactly-right-the-first-time fields). All of the other choices were gotchas based on common errors you may have made because the inadequate teaching you received hadn't prepared you to do it exactly right. \n\nAnd then abruptly midway through the course, the graded homework stopped, replaced by a torrent of lectures -- nearly 100 more videos crammed full of micro-topics with no indication as to what was important, what would be tested on, what was intended to ground larger important concepts. The practice problems were absolutely all over the place, making it totally unclear as to what we could expect on the final. \n\nStaff didn't seem to care about student's concerns when these were voiced. Flury's most common response to students worried about their grade was that the grades overall were adequate. When students said concepts weren't clear, the typical response was essentially that, yes, they were. Oh, sorry, our bad, I guess.\n\nThis was my fourth online class through Georgia Tech and by far the worst. I thoroughly enjoyed the other three, and look forward to the rest of the program. Had MGT 6754 been the first I took, I would not have returned. The contrast is about what I would expect from a school with a top-ten-rated analytics program and a business school described by the Financial Times as \"third-tier.\" ",

            "text": "This was my first OMSCS class. \nOverall, I think it's a good class. I learned a lot and certainly think I have a foundation for reinforcement learning now.  I had to do all sorts of outside research, but I think that is expected.  The T.A's did a great job, shoutout to all of them (especially Chris Serrano for his slack help during P2) they were very supportive and active on piazza and slack.\n\nI have a background in ML so that was helpful (especially for P2, where you need to basically use DL).  The videos are mostly good, but I highly recommend people to watch David Silver series.  It seriously helps for the first 4 HW's and 2 projects.  I would actually watch him first, then Charles and Michael.  They are very deep and abstract, while he is really concrete and practical.  I think it's better to have the \"normal\" stuff first before you get blasted into space and time.\n\nMy main issue was with the lectures actually, it's just very theoretical material and I could not always follow.  Watching at 1.3x speed is a good idea to get broad strokes, especially if you don't love proofs.\n\nThe final is pretty hard -  make sure to study for it.\n\nFinally, I did well on the projects, but I somehow unlocked what the T.A's did not spell out. Which is that you need to write your report about what the project means, not what you did. Which may not be obvious, because doing the actual work involved a lot of head-banging and late nights, so by the time you are done with the work you may forget to think about why you did it at all.\n\n\n",

There were so many times I wanted to quit because it was so difficult, but I persevered and I am pretty sure I did well enough on the final to pass.  The homeworks seem almost impossible at times.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  If you can't do some of the problems just do the best you can (they are only worth 5% of the overall grade) and wait for the solutions to be released and then go back and learn how to do the problems.  The exam questions are similar to the homeworks and actually seem a little easier than the homework problems.  Professor Vigoda says he wants the HW to challenge you.  So, if you can understand how to do them, you should be pretty well prepared for the exams.  To prepare for this class, you can go to the course website to see the topics and watch some youtube videos on them.  The MIT OCW videos were also helpful at times for a different perspective.  Dr. Vigoda places a strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming.  He once stated on the forums, if you don't know DP you won't pass this class.  DP boggled my mind when I first encountered the topic.  However, I leave the class relatively confident that I could apply it one day if necessary.  The lecture videos are excellent, he repeats the information enough that it sinks in better than some courses where they just state the facts and immediately move on.  I can't believe I'm saying this after how difficult it was... but after it was all over I actually liked it.  If it was easy, it wouldn't have the same meaning or impart the same feeling of accomplishment and that's why we're at GaTech, right?",

You'll be doing a ton of writing. We had three 1500-word project reflections, three 1000-word assignments, a take-home 2000-word midterm, a take-home 3000-word final, and three Peer Feedbacks to complete for each of those. Coding is limited to your 3 projects, which for most will be focused on writing a program that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (Java or Python with Pillow/NumPy). A small group of students was allowed to pursue Alternative Projects 2 and 3 which focused on writing a FAQ-based chatbot (Python/NLTK). The lectures were well-made, but cover very high level topics. There really isn't anything that helps you synthesize the course concepts. The RPM project only vaguely relates, depending on your approach, and the assignments and exams make it easy to cherry-pick through the lectures to get your answers, which are often somewhat subjective anyway. The course is very generously curved with anything over the class mean being an A, so it's an easy course overall. The instructor/TA interaction on Piazza is great and I was glad to see Dr Goel engaging with students at least a few times each week, even while traveling. We had a nice community going on Slack, too, which helped build camaraderie and made it fun to participate. Peer Feedbacks were very hit and miss and probably should have been scrapped entirely for the Final Exam. Peer grading didn't affect anything, but led to morale drops when getting overly-negative feedback and a lot of confusion when asked to grade another student without knowing the correct answer. Overall, it's a fine class. It's front-loaded, smoothly-run, and generally fun, but you're not likely to come out of it with many new skills that can be directly applied to anything. As with most courses, though, it's what you make of it.",

The course does not dive deep into the implementation aspect of machine learning algorithms. So set your expectation straight! The two professors are really entertaining, they did a great job in adding colors to the materials which are dry in nature. I love most of the lectures except the one on Markov Decision Process. To me, it would be more intuitive to walk through an example of value iteration before throwing tons of equations at the audience. The course did exactly the opposite which gave me a hard time. Outside the lectures, the course itself is depressing. There are four assignments in the course. They are asking serious a lot for each. I would expect to spend 100 hours for each assignment to get to the place where they expect you to be. Unfortunately it is not realistic since i am juggling between job, family and study as most of us here. The grading criteria should be better communicated, my overall impression is that the grading lacks consistency. TAs give grade based on their personal tastes.  The feedback should be more constructive and to motivate students to explore more. To me, the feedback is only a list of missing tests which are only implied in the assignment specification. I was discouraged each time after reading the TA's feedback. Overall, this is a reasonably well organized course. The materials are quite dry and TAs are expecting a lot from your assignment without telling exactly what they want you to do.",

That is what the grading is like. There is another review that states \"... we need to develop the ability to do independent research ...\". This doesn't do anything in that regard. Assignments are meant to hone your understanding of the material and a rubric helps students focus that effort to ensure it's not a futile endeavor. From the instructors comments there clearly is a rubric they use to grade. You as a student are not privy to this rubric unless you took the course before or received it from former students. \n\nI wanted to really like this course. The setup was there for it to be one of the best courses available for OMSCS. However, it is not. The enjoyment of this course was far overshadowed by the bad.",

The udacity assignments (problem sets + mini robot) should be 100% and that covers about 40% of grade.  Be very careful about falling behind on project 2 as you'll want to have a good implementation of it as project 3 is a very difficult extension of it.  I think all told I spent close to 100+ hours on projects 2/3 together.  I would highly recommend a TDD approach for these later projects because they can get pretty complicated and finding bugs once the system is fully built can be very difficult.

I came into this class with programming knowledge (python) and some linear algebra but almost zero R experience and no analytics experience.   This class was more time consuming for me because I've had very little exposure to analytical modelling.  If you come into this class with experience how much time you need each week will go down considerably.  Early on in the course getting up to speed on R was a challenge but once I was comfortable in R the amount of time required for the homework goes down quite a bit.  There is homework almost every week.  It's well designed and if you actually try to learn you'll learn quite a bit.  I encourage people to use the TA office hours as confirmation of approach after you have tried to solve the homework on your own.  You'll learn far less if you just watch the TA office hours and copy their code.  Exams are hard but fair.  Dr Sokol does a good job of making you think.  The videos for this class are very well done and to me shows Dr Sokol's strong understanding of the MOOC format.

I have my undergrad in business, but I am always hesitant to skip courses as I feel that you can always learn something.  In the end, I learned very little in this class.  There are two major issues with this class, one the professors have no clue how to teach an online course in this format and two, the content of the class is too generic.  The clearest example of that is their videos.  The videos are basically just one hour lectures broken up into smaller segments.  The videos are too long and inefficient and some of them (strategy and marketing) end up sounding as if the professor is just reading out of a text book.  The videos are generally long and rambling.  It makes them hard to rewatch if you need to brush up on concepts.  There is very little in the way of graded assignments and no homework assignments that cover marketing or strategy.  When I finished the second finance homework (the last homework of the semester) is was Halloween and I didn't touch this class again for almost a month.   The exams are fine.  The no partial credit thing is brutal on the exams.  So many of the questions are of the \"Pick all that apply\" type and to miss one and get zero credit is dumb.  There are high point value finance questions that are quite involved where one small error could torpedo your answer and materially impact your grade.  On the final 28 of the last 108 points of the exam were tied up in four fairly involved financial calculations that you are doing with an on screen calculator (set aside the fact that only an idiot would not do this in excel or without a financial calculator).  \n\nThe content of this class also needs a rework.  This class is so generic that you could require it in ANY non business graduate program and the class would not need to be changed in any way.  Analytics is NEVER mentioned.  Even when you're in the marketing module where it is obvious that a detailed discussion of analytics could add value, it doesn't happen. The content goes way too far into the weeds.  I am studying to be an analytics professional not get an MBA.  Far too much time in finance and accounting was spent on how to low level detail calculations for things like NPV, weighted average cost of capital and activity based costing .  I can see needing to know what these are and how they are used, but I will never be asked to take this down to this level.  \n\nThe content of the course just reeks of laziness honestly. Either the business school doesn't understand how to do online education or they don't care.  ",

Watch a few of them and you'll see the dynamic between professors Isbell and Littman. The order of material, the quizzes, and the examples are all generally good as well.\n\n* Exams - A midterm and a final, which only addressed material since the midterm. The exams were straightforward, covered a nice breadth of material, and were appropriately difficult. My only criticism is that the midterm had way more content than time to answer it. The final did not have that problem. \n\n* Assignments - Bittersweet (for me at least). Each of the four was relevant, rewarding, and quite time-consuming. My two main criticisms are 1) you are asked to think deeply on a topic you are presently learning, which, for me, is tough; and 2) the assignments are broadly and loosely scoped. Personally, I finished every assignment feeling as though I learned a ton, but each grade reflected just the opposite. More structure in the assignments would have helped me focus on what I needed to learn rather than waste time trying to figure out what the TA wants me to address.\n\nOverall: Excellent material that I've been wanting to learn the foundations of for a while.

There are a lot of lectures to keep up with each week, along with a problem set due every two weeks. The problem sets vary in difficulty and level of effort. Some took me as much as 60 hours to finish. Nonetheless, the problem sets do a good job of reinforcing the material covered in the lectures and help you develop a deeper understanding of it. Plus, the problem sets are interesting. Many times after finishing a problem set I found myself staring at the results in amazement. How many people can say they've implemented an augmented reality system and facial recognition software? I cannot recommend this class more highly.",

You work on a number of quick assignments, as well as 3 essays, but the bulk of the course is spent on a group project. Lectures are good but light on content, you're finished with them halfway through the course. The group project is teams made up of 4-6 people working on mostly pre-defined projects in the healthcare field. In most projects you work with a mentor who is in the healthcare field. As long as you're with a competent team the group project should be fairly manageable. This course would pair nicely with another course as its workload is light and you can balance around a lot of the work to fit your schedule.    ",

In my opinion, The videos are definitely the best in the OMSCS. The material is dense but Dr Bobick cuts through the math and makes it digestible. He has a great sense of humor, and even his interaction with Megan (the videographer) cracked me up several times. Even the seemingly small detail of having a black background was well thought out, and make the videos not too straining to the eye. The problem sets are hard and you need to get on them as soon as possible. Beware of the first major assignment (Road sign detection) because it is deceivingly difficult, and the video tracking assignment which was super difficult as well. The final project will easily take up the time of 3 assignments put together. Matthew Houston definitely deserves high praise for his high-quality recorded office hours. To conclude, It's a lot of work, but you'll be glad you did it.\n\nAs an aside, I was looking at the table of contents of the CV books on Amazon, and was amazed that the class covered MORE THAN ENTIRE BOOKS on the subject!",

            "text": "Incredible class. The material is extremely interesting, and the assignments/project weren't overly difficult and really emphasized lecture material (although they were VERY time consuming). This was my first class in the program, but this course is probably one of the best courses I've ever taken! Including all of my graduate-level classes as well! Very rewarding, but very time-consuming.\n\nThere is a huge amount of material covered. It helps that Dr.Bobick's videos are not only incredibly well laid out and clear, but also quite enjoyable to watch. They're also very thorough, so as long as you can fit enough time to dedicate to lectures (4-6 hours a week) you'll learn quite a bit within each topic. Assignments matched the lecture material fairly well, and were for the most part well-defined and weren't too confusing.\n\nAssignment breakdown with estimated difficulty / time consumption for those that like this sort of thing:\nAssignment 1 -- easy; ~4-8 hours\nAssignment 2 -- hard; 40-60 hours\nAssignment 3 -- mid; ~25-40 hours\nAssignment 4 -- mid; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 5 -- mid/hard; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 6 -- mid; ~20-30 hours\n\nWe had 2 weeks to complete each assignment, and they were always back-to-back so there was really no break in between. Previous offerings of the class seem to have had additional assignments, but starting this term we had a final project instead of the last (2?) assignment(s). The final project had a few selection options, to further explore more advanced and state-of-the-art algorithms for methods we used in assignments and/or other material presented in class that we didn't work on in assignments, and we were given 3 weeks to complete it. Many people thought there were too many things required to be completed for the projects, particularly the convolutional neural network project, so it could easily take 70+ hours to complete everything. A lot of the time spent on assignments and even on the final project is parameter tweaking. Be prepared to have fairly well designed algorithms in place, but spend loads of time tweaking parameter values to achieve optimal results.\n\nThe final exam was open-book and the study guide was very representative of what you needed to know for it. It was a fair exam. As long as you can review most, if not all, of the material beforehand, and find answers to all of the practice questions in the study guide, the exam is not difficult at all. Questions tended to be pretty base-level, focusing mainly on overall concepts and important algorithm details discussed in class. \n\nTAs were for the most part responsive, but as others have noted, Matthew Houston's office hours were a huge asset in completing the assignments. The forums were very helpful for finding out where to go when you were stuck and/or for discussing the assignments.\n\nI highly recommend this class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. It would help to review some linear algebra, and numpy if you aren't comfortable with using it yet. If you have some time, you could try and familiarize yourself with openCV 2.4 as well, as you'll be using this package a lot in the class. Don't wait until the last minute to start assignments, start on them early so it doesn't bite you when the deadlines approach!",

At first it didn't seem clear what level of linear algebra we'd need to be successful in the course—as someone who hadn't studied matrix manipulation in about 20 years, I was apprehensive. But the ramp-up was gradual, and they did a good job of explaining sophisticated concepts while providing surface-level challenges.\n\nI started the class having just taken CS1301x, also available on edX. I highly recommend students take this course (or similar) before embarking on CSE6040. I also took the GA Tech linear algebra primer on Udacity. I feel like I would have been playing an exhausting game of catch-up if I hadn't. If you don't have Python experience, get some before enrolling.\n\nI found the challenge balance very satisfying. It definitely broadened and stretched my understanding of the math side of data manipulation. There were times when I thought I was finally in hopelessly over my head, but a bit of research or just plain staring at the code eventually led to (very satisfying) breakthroughs.\n\nI appreciate how responsive the instructor was to changing the test format from two proctored hours to 24 unproctored. It much better measured our ability and concept absorption—and was also confiding to know the staff were listening to our concerns in real time. That's a big deal in an online course.",

For regression, for example, we got into things like elastic net, and regularization, etc. Tests were not too bad if you did a reasonable amount of preparation (you were allowed a cheat sheet, both sides). Interestingly, I found that my cheat sheets really didn't help. I found that for most questions, I either knew the answers, or nothing in my notes would have mattered anyway. If you come into this class with no R experience, get ready for a steep learning curve. In my case, I certainly had some basic knowledge, but found that having a copy of \"Introduction to Statistical Learning\" came in handy. \nAt the beginning of the course many people freaked out due to the seemingly steep R learning curve. But, as was pointed out, the homeworks were designed more for learning than testing. As it was, homework counted for relatively little of the grade, and submitting ANYTHING would get you a 50% score. And, since homework only counted for 16% of the grade total, that means you could have done almost nothing and ace the test and come in a 92% course grade. \nHaving said that, I really tried on each homework assignment to do the very best I could. \nAfter the early weeks, the latter part of the course was a bit easier, with the written project more conceptual. \nOverall, good course, certainly increased my confidence in figuring things out with R.

How to carefully break down product costs? Yep. How VCs generally work and how they'd value a startup? Check. How marketers focus on segmentation, targeting, positioning, and those famous 4 P's? Right. What the heck business strategy consultants think about? Roger. None of which I knew before. For that I'm grateful.\n\nHowever, the presentation was extremely dry (like a video textbook, as another reviewer put it) and spent far too much time on minutiae instead of exploring big concepts, applying them on our own (which is how I really learn), or connecting them to analytics. I was expecting at least to do one project-type assignment, such as creating a mock business strategy or marketing plan, but no, that kind of deeper/applied thinking counted squat toward your grade. Instead, to satisfy the gradebook, you had to subject yourself to a merciless grind that I can only describe as memorizing shuffled decks of cards and hand-calculating answers to story problems that combine 7th grade math with financial jargon.",

Then just copy the test cell data into a new cell and use that to debug you code. The set-up of the homework made it feel like they wanted you to succeed and were giving you the framework to do so.

And, for me at least, it helped me figure out which electives I wanted to take.\n\nNow, with that said, it's a challenging class especially if you've never used R before. I find it to be a pretty finicky programming language, and there were nights where I struggled for an hour or two to figure out what I was doing. By the time I was done, I felt like I had learned a good bit, though, so maybe it was worth it.\n\nHomeworks aren't bad, though a bit time consuming. Midterms/final were a little bit tricky - you really have to sit and think through a question and pick the answer that seems the most right. You get a handwritten cheat sheet for each midterm and 2 of them for the final - and these saved me. But you need to put a lot on them since briefly covered concepts could be on the exams.\n\nProject for the class was simple enough and followed the format of other case studies.\n\nIt's not easy, but you learn a whole lot, and it's a great introduction to what to expect for the rest of the OMSA program.",

I've programmed in Python for several years, so I was able to complete the programming assignments with little strain. However, even with my previous experience I still found valuable kernels of insight in this thoughtfully prepared course. You can tell professor Vudoc has a passion for the material and a careful approach to the pedagogy of teaching a mixed-level, program-required class. If there is one criticism I share with the other respondents it's that the class seems a little rushed just when it starts to get really good towards the end. If the early material could be compacted a bit and the later material expanded I think this class would be a must-attend, even for those more experienced with CS. However, I understand the need to accommodate those who are not as far along on their analytics journey, so I don't hold it against the staff.",

There is no curve, and the mid-term and final exams are like sprints, you barely have time to complete them, and a lot of students actually weren't able to complete the mid-term. The extra credit assignment is a joke, it requires more effort to complete than multiple projects combined, and it only contributes to 2% of your total grade. These horrible features of this course make it extremely nerve-racking, because you can easily lose a letter grade in the blink of an eye. It almost seems at times as if the professor dislikes seeing students do good in this course, and he tries really hard to prevent you from earning an A; I was able to earn one in the end, but it wasn't an \"easy A\" at all. I personally avoided asking questions via Reddit, because of the snarky replies the professor would issue to students. The course serves as a good introduction to Machine Learning, and you get to apply Machine Learning to stock trading in the last project, which was awesome.  Something else which you need to consider is the fact that projects build on each other, therefore if you fail to complete a project, or you implement it incorrectly, you will be toast.",

The projects are difficult (would be extremely difficult if your C/C++ background is very limited). Tons of papers to read. The exams are also difficult, though previous exam solutions are extremely helpful. Exam questions don't seem to strictly repeat, but tend to cover the same concepts.\n\nThe workload isn't extreme. I had some experience in C/C++ and most of the projects took 20-30 hours, with the exception of project 4, which is a huge project and took me well over 40 hours. I generally spent 6ish hours on papers and lectures per week.\n\nOverall, the class is informative, well-run, and the projects are useful and interesting.

            "text": "I came into the class already knowing SQL and Spark in scala fairly well, and had taken the rest of the ML specialization already, so take my workload and difficulty ratings with a grain of salt. Here are some things that might be helpful to know:\n- You need to know how to calculate partial derivatives, use the chain rule, etc. You have to derive various update equations and then code them. In other words, if you weren't able to derive the equations, you wouldn't be able to do the entire rest of the homework and would get a terrible score. That could really rain on someone's parade.\n- You are required to use scala for Spark (except on the Group Project). You are not allowed to use pyspark. \n- There are 4 homework assignments and then a group project. No exams.\n- You need to know SQL for most of the homework\n- The first homework uses Pandas and sklearn. The rest do not.\n- The second homework uses Hive, Pig, Map-Reduce, and scala Spark in Zeppelin. You don't need to know Hive, Pig or Map-Reduce very well. Just do the practice lab before the course starts and you will be fine on those.\n- The 3rd and 4th homework are scala Spark. You need to know it pretty well.\n- The 4th homework uses Spark's Graph-X. \n- The Group Project is worth a lot of your grade. A lot of people did projects based on Deep Learning.\n\nWARNING: when testing your homework using their test scripts, do not assume your code is correct if it passes. Their tests are inadequate. Many students complained of having passed all the tests but then losing lots of points.\n\nPros of the course: Great practical experience in big data. The homework was very worthwhile and I enjoyed it.\nCons of the course: This course could be great if anyone on the teaching staff would dedicate even a little bit of effort. They will give you a set up for Zeppelin using Docker that takes many hours to complete and then you find out at the end that the set-up doesn't work, and in fact, when they gave it to you, THEY ALREADY KNEW IT DIDN'T WORK because it didn't work in the previous semesters either. And they still keep handing it out. No respect for students' time whatsoever. The instructions in general are frequently ambiguous or wrong, and no efforts are made to correct them. The TAs make brief appearances on piazza to give 3 word responses that do not answer the question that was asked. The professor of record has no interaction with the class whatsoever -- not even a single piazza post -- except each group for the group projects were allowed to meet with him for 10 minutes over 3 days of his choosing. Then after we all cleared out our schedule for the great honor, at the last minute, he cancelled and told everybody on that day they needed to move to day x. Which of course most of us could not do without any advanced notice. So I never had a single interaction with him. Lastly, the pacing of the course is bizarre -- almost backwards. The more time a homework or task takes, the less time you are given to do it. And the easier it is, the more time you are given to do it. The homework and project are not given out ahead of time so there is no way for students to correct for this.\n\nI still liked the class despite all this in that it really did help me become confident with big data technologies and scala Spark in particular. It just frustrates me to know end that the course could be SO much better with just a little effort.",

The lectures are twenty minute sleeping pills where a menagerie of different professors read slides verbatim and provide long, rambling, and excessive examples to the point of further confusion. The course content is all over the place and seems hastily assembled, as if someone just concatenated four standard-length courses into a Frankenstein's monster of business school intro courses. Grades are few and far between (the two exams count for 70% of the grade), and the professor (the one of four presumably in charge) seems to have little if any grasp on online quiz structure, having involved, high point value multi-step questions for which there is no partial credit (e.g. \"Select the correct eight of these fifteen possible answers\"), and incorrect responses that seem to want to actively trick students into wrong answers instead of guiding the learning process. On Piazza, when the professor chooses to make an appearance, he is usually combative and seems to often resent the sheer audacity of those who may want to actually learn this material. The course would be a poor refresher for those pursuing an MBA, and seems especially inappropriate for those pursuing a degree in computational analytics. Towards the end it became clear that at no point would any of the material actually tie into analytics, making it even further baffling that this course is foundational for the analytics program at Georgia Tech.\n\nFor those considering taking this course, I can simply suggest you put it off as long as possible, in hopes the course will be reworked or removed altogether.\n\nFor those responsible for building and administering OMS programs, I can only say this course is an embarrassment and actively damages the reputation of the OMS community.",

            "text": "So, this is my honest review of the class. The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don't recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming.  In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don't get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\n\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don't pass any of the test cases, you don't get any marks. It doesn't matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\n\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\n\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available.",

Very well organized, and a fair grading scheme. No grading on a curve so everyone cooperates on Piazza (within the 'no sharing code' constraint).  I could feel myself learning as the course progressed. Mind blowing feeling to go from knowing nothing, to knowing, uh.. something (Prof. Bobick style joke), and as an added bonus you will develop an internal clock that always knows AoE time. What makes the course hard? The sheer volume of videos to watch and assignments to complete in a short 17 weeks. Here's my time breakdown by week measured by Toggl, so you can schedule your accordingly: 18, 20, 24, 26, 22, 31, 32, 21, 16, 15, 24, 24, 23, 14, 50, 31, 16. That 50 is not from leaving the timer running by mistake - it's the time I packed in attempting to do the final project which I found incredibly difficult. The week before that with only 14 hours was the one I spent flailing around, despairing of being able to do the final project. Advice for others 1. Don't fall behind on watching the lectures! Watch them all before doing the assignments - even without taking notes and/or at 2x speed. They might seem to not be connected to the assignments, but they open up your mind to things that will help you do the assignmets - and certainly will make a big difference preparing for the exam. 2. Start assignments the minute the day they are released. Don't procrastinate because usually success in the assignments (especially if you're a newbie) is more a function of time than anything else. 3. Make an effort to post questions to the Office Hours, or be familiar with the assignment so you can benefit more from them - Mathew Houston's recorded OH were extremely helpful. 4. In the assignments, strive for 100% because the final project is 5 times harder than any assignment and you have only 3 weeks to complete it (took me about 85 hours to turn in something not so great), so it's likely to bring your grade down.\nSome criticism: The assignments have a lot of starter code written for you, so you can learn Python and OpenCV as you go along, however, it would have helped if the Matlab quizzes in the lectures were replaced with OpenCV ones (but Pedro the TA did provide OpenCV versions for some of them). The biggest criticism is that because of the final project, there are no assignments on the later sections and I didn't feel like I really learnt them.",

While I found the lecture material interesting, I think there is far too much focus on the photography aspect of the course.  While the camera obscurra is a neat project, I don't think it has any place here.\n\nProfessor:  While very clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the material, it seems that his involvement ends with the lectures.\nTAs:  Overall seemed dismissive with questions, especially with the midterm research project.  They're given the task of teaching the course\nGrading:  The 90% Above and Beyond is the stupidest grading rubric I've ever come across.\nProjects:  While interesting, I don't believe they'll ever benefit me.\nTest:  The test is open book and there are two attempts; this sounds great...but like another reviewer put it, \"turns into a digital scavenger hunt.\"  I also found it to be marred by difficult/tricky wording (most likely by someone whose first language is not english) with a majority of the questions being of the delightful format, \"Select all that apply/are correct\".  I did not feel that the final exam tested my knowledge of anything that you might take away from the course.  Also covers quite a few papers that aren't really discussed during lectures.\nTime commitment: If I'm combining the time spent working on assignments with the time to watch lectures, then it's about 20 hours, if not counting the lectures it's a bit less than that.\n\nOverall:  I was thinking about the perception specialization, but this course turned me off to that completely.  If this were the first course I've taken in the program, I'd likely question why I was bothering at all.  I regret taking this course, and in the future I hope to avoid all those involved in its creation.",

            "text": "This was my first OMCS course and my day-job is in Network Engineering. So I consider myself better prepared than most for the course topics.\n\nFirst of all, like reviews from the summer semester, the course professor barely interacted at all. I recall an office hours for the first test and there was one set of discussion questions. The class was essentially ran by the Head TA, who did a fine job, but it was disappointing to miss that expert-level interaction. And for a course with 400+ students, that's quite an ask for the Head TA. \n\nIt will definitely help if you have some background in computer networking, especially in Part 1 of the course. Some fairly complicated networking topics are not explained with an appropriate level of detail. If you don't have the background on standard routing and switching technologies you'll likely need to do supplemental research to handle the first two projects. \n\nThe tests cover a lot of material and the questions are fairly subjective overall. It can be tough to know what the \"best\" answer is. Still, they aren't unfair and if you complete the test preparation questions you should be fine.\n\nSome reviews have characterized this course as \"Network Programming in Python\". This is hardly accurate. The course clearly lists at least an introductory level in Python is required. The first two projects are probably the hardest of the semester, but both can be completed with around 50 lines of code. The real challenge is in understanding the algorithm. The code itself requires nothing more than the ability to use variables, follow control logic, and pass messages, all capabilities learned in any introductory computer science course. The undergraduate networking course required implementations in C, and those projects were much more time-consuming then anything found here.\n\nOverall, I recommend the course to anyone interested in Computer Networks as an operational discipline. If you just want to know how to write networking code as an applications developer, this course isn't for you.",

For the final project, if you want you can build a working prototype. \nIn summary, this course is writing, writing and more writing.\nThere are 10 assignments and 2 projects. There are two types of assignments P-type and M-type, P is based on principles and M is based on methods.\nLectures are very engaging and drive home the concepts very well. If you have already working in UX and/or designing great apps, then this course will be a cake walk and you just need to spend only 5 to 6 hours per week. However, I come from an embedded background with no UX experience, so all the concepts were new and I needed more time. \nThe strategy that works best is to choose a domain and a problem in that domain that you want to solve and a few apps that you can review. You watch the lecture on a Monday, read the questions to be answered for the assignment, internalize the concept and apply them on everything you do in the next three days, then just reflect on your experience for the questions asked in the assignment.\nWe have two proctored exams and they are a bit tough. Take proper notes while watching the lectures and diligently read all the weekly readings. The readings were made compulsory from Fall 2017 and 1/3 of the questions in the test come from those. As I didn't do the readings, my test scores are not great. \nThis can be easily taken along with another intermediate course, if the other one is full of programming like CV or AI then this writing will complement the heavy programming.",

            "text": "Very well-done course. It's hard to imagine a better introduction to the Analytics program -- you should definitely take this your first semester.  This course does a great job of surveying the world of what most people are calling \"data science\" nowadays -- basic data preparation plus a wide array of both machine learning and traditional statistical modeling techniques. If you put a good amount of time and effort into the homework (and don't just copy the TA office-hour solutions), this class also goes surprisingly deep into some topics.  You WILL want some experience with R prior to the course or you will be spending double the hours/week.  It is also a great idea to get familiar with RMarkdown documents since they are a great format for submitting homework.\n\nAlthough I ended up with an A, my only complaints about the class relate to the grade weighting and some exam questions.  First, the homework and course project are low weight compared to the amount of work required and understanding gained (16% hw, 9% project). In addition, one feels a bit cheated when the course project is merely peer-graded and your peers don't provide much feedback. The peer grading in general was not very helpful as I rarely got any comments, just a numeric score -- I would learn more with tougher HW feedback from an instructor. The exams felt unnecessarily high-pressure and high-stakes, because they were (75% of grade for 3 exams). While about 80% of the exam questions were pretty easy, 5-10% were subtle/difficult, and about 10-15% were just badly constructed -- either expecting us to \"think on our feet\" about applying/combining concepts that only got minimal lecture time, or having ambiguous wording/intent, or relying on a very artificial set-up, or making too many assumptions and providing too little context. Some were major traps for people prone to overthinking.  In addition, the exams leaned toward fewer questions with higher point values each, which can really bite you. Fortunately there's a fairly generous curve that will add 5-6 % points.  In general, if you want a solid pre-curve A, you should do extra reading on each modeling technique covered and your studying should focus more on big-picture, situational application and pros/cons of different techniques. \n\nAll in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a ton.  Dr. Sokol's lecture videos are engaging and clear, including many examples from his own consulting experience. It's obvious he loves the subject too.",

Despite their own course loads, they were present on piazza (&slack) answering questions; both technical & logistical...\nThe only not-so-positive aspect for me personally was that a significant portion of assignment grades were deteremined by quality of report.

But on the brighter side, it's gave an opportunity for me to improve on these aspects (which is definitely important in professional life).\nOver & above the computation part, the fun aspect was experimenting with photography...

Ok, bleeding-edge might be a bit of a stretch, but you will learn something new :-).  Also, fair warning to those considering this as your first class. This class can take a lot of time depending on your background. Don't let the average workload fool you. My background academic experience consisted of predominately electrical engineering courses sprinkled with skeleton computer science code problems during my undergraduate program. My current job is a System Administrator and I hardly touch code. I can definitely say I this class took a lot of time due to my background. If you are like me and you don't have a decent amount of software development experience, I would recommend taking SDP before this class. You definitely don't have to take Software Development Process before this one to excel, but I believe SDP would give you the exposure of typical bugs software engineers/software developers would encounter. This exposure would give the student a deeper appreciation of techniques presented in this course. I believe anyone can take this class and do well if you work hard; however, to shave off time of some of the projects it will serve you well to have a solid grasp of C/C++ i.e pointers, pass-by-reference, STL, etc. and Java, some graph theory terminology i.e. node, edge, path, directed etc, algorithms of common data structures such as trees, linked lists, and arrays, very basic probability and statistics, and all of the common operations from Set Theory.

If you have questions during the course, don't be afraid to ask the instructors, they won't bite :-). If I had done this for the first couple of projects of the course, I more than likely would have had a better outcome.  What can I say? This was my first rodeo so I had to live and learn. Exams are very hard and will require a good bit of study time to do well. For my class, they provided a very watered-down version of the exams as a review and that helped a lot. This was my first of two classes in the OMS program and I did learn a lot. Hopefully, this review will be of some help to you and I wish you the best in your future endeavors with this program. Good luck! ",

This course provided a refresh on calculus and linear algebra which I guess is useful when I get deeper in ML. I also took this course to learn R as a new language, which I think the course material did a good job on that, but maybe too much as it seems like it assumes minimum background in coding. So if you, like me, are a professional developer for years, you may find it boring.\n\nThe workload is light, only exception is the first project which you need to do some partial derivatives and implement a logistic regression model using R from scratch. The requirement wasn't clear until couple of days before the deadline, which makes it hard if you want to finish it early on you own pace. But since most of the HW and projects are due early Monday mornings, you have good chance to spend your weekend and should be able to get it done. I still remember the last project which is due the Monday after thanksgiving and I had to bring laptop with me and did some coding while on vacation in Fairebanks, Alaska. It was good memory though :)\n",

            "text": "This course made me question my sanity.  The assignments are So.  Hard.  I have a degree in computer science and 4 semesters of calculus, but still could not decipher the mathematical formulas we were given to implement our code.  I easily spent 40+ hours a week, 20+ hours spent trying to decipher the assignment.  Some people claimed they finished assignments (even the final!) in 3 days - I spent every spare minute on my computer from the minute assignments were released to the hour the assignment was due, and I was still lucky to get a B.\nThe course is great, really.  I loved watching the videos, and you learn some fantastic state-of-the-art stuff, like sensing road signs for self-driving cars, to how to create special effects like you see in the movies.  The difficulty comes from being asked to implement these things using just the math.  You've introduced to the topic, the theory explained, the math given and explained, and then off you go!  The problem is that none of that gives you an algorithm to implement.  I found it incredibly frustrating to interpret the math, and in the end had to conclude half of it was nonsense, unless that large 'E' symbol means something other than sum, and every time they ask you to subtract the mean (average), they are just kidding.\n\nIn the end the only reason I passed was because I ignored the formulas, looked at code off the internet, and got the source code for the openCV functions we weren't allowed to use, and painstakingly over several days, went line-by-line through the dense C++ code, figured out what it was doing, where it matched with the formula we were given, where it didn't, and rewriting everything into python.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of time, don't take this course.  You cannot skip a lecture, and will probably end up watching all of them several times, rewinding to go over some dense explanation.  If, however, you do have the time, want to learn some amazing skills, and can decipher mathematical equations with ease, you will love this course.",

It had a world renown professor, the head of google's self driving cars, who knows his stuff, explains complex topics in intuitive ways, is enthusiastic and has a sense of humor.  The TAs are great, on top of every thread.  And if you're into this sort of thing, it is E.A.S.Y.  The answers are given!   You can literally just cut and paste code from the answers page and put it in.  The TAs are ok with this.  The lectures are short, and there is no complex mathematics anywhere that you find in many other OMSCS courses (it's all simple trigonometry).  This is the best course ever, and the *perfect* introduction to OMSCS.  If you are just starting your masters, you want this course.\n\nMy only complaint is it was too easy.  Now, a lot of other reviews say it was hard, so hard they dropped out, and there was too much math.  Let me address this.  First, If they think there was too much math here, or it was hard, they obviously haven't taken a truly hard class, like Machine Learning, Graduate Algorithms, AI, Computer Vision, etc etc.  If they found this hard, I don't see how they would be able to graduate.  There is NO math required to get an A (again, you can just cut-and-paste answers).  \n\nThe reason people think it is hard is because they shoot themselves in the foot.  They did not ask 'is there an easier way to do this?'.  They did not read the requirements carefully, or assumed too much.  For example, for the projects, you are asked to predict the next location of a robot.  The lectures are about Kalman filters, and so many people naturally assumed you should be using a Kalman Filter.  But see, that is not anywhere in the assignment.  Why even bother, when it's such a simple solution? The robot is moving a fixed distance at a fixed angle.  SImple trigonometry will give you the answer.  The next assignment, the measurements are noisy, and these people again, for whatever reason, shoot themselves in the foot and try to use a Kalman filter.  It's non-linear noisy movement, so they try to implement the Extended Kalman Filter.  Again, there is no need to do that!  The EKF isn't even mentioned!  There were posts after posts on the Extended Kalman Filter, pages and pages devoted to the topic, for absolutely no reason.   Why do unneccessary work like 'calculating the determinate of the Jacobian Matrix'?  I have no idea.\nThe only assignments you're not given the answers to are the 3 projects.  There are people reporting 100+ hours on the third project alone.  I handed it in within 3 days, and got a 100%.  These people are trying to do it the hard way, like calculate probabilities for distant objects, trying to implement difficult algorithms like graph slam, all for no reason.  Sure, all those things were suggested in the descriptions, and that's what the lectures are about, so kudos to you if you wanted to go that route.  But, and I can't emphasize this enough, there is no need for any of that.  There's no move limit, you can ram into as many walls as you like - that means you can design the most inefficent algorithm you want.  You can randomly carom your robot about the screen and, while slow and ugly, will eventually traverse the entire warehouse.  I can mathematically prove it if you want.\nPoint is, if you're willing to solve problems in your own way, and not the complicated way, you'll do just fine in this class.  I didn't even know python when starting this course and my final grade is 99.5%\n\n",

The course also required you to read the text book (DPV mainly) and do the practice problems. Overall, course is not too hard if you have some CS knowledge (data structures, recursion, graphs etc).

There were about 30 hours of lectures which seems like more than some of the other classes in the program.  It's important to watch them before working on assignments since the implementation steps for some of the problem sets are directly given in the lectures.  The TAs were great at releasing the problem sets and grades on a regular 2 week schedule.  Matthew Houston also gave well prepared office hours that he recorded weekly which were very helpful.  The final project had 5 possible topics and requires a lot of work; my advice is to limit your scope initially because you may otherwise try something too ambitious and not be as pleased with your results.  The open note final was pretty straightforward.  Taking CP first was very helpful for me since I hadn't touched python in a decade and I wrote more code for the traffic sign detection problem set than I did in all of CP (including my final project).  The overlap in some of the topics with CP also helped me feel more comfortable in completing the CV problem sets.  I really enjoyed the class and wish there were more CV classes to take.",

The material is vast, but the goal is to give you high level understanding of a broad set of tools.  Specifically, the professors focus on what certain algorithms do, what specific algorithms are good and bad at, intuition behind how they work, and how they are similar and different from other algorithms.  The focus is NOT on how to implement each individual algorithm or how to use specific ML tools and frameworks.  I heard or read at some point (maybe even during a lecture?) that one of the goals of the class is to provide students the tools to become ML researchers.  I think this course does a great job at that, while also giving students the opportunity to pick up specific tools as they desire.\n\nIn my opinion, it helps to take DVA before this class if you are not coming from an ML background.  Even if you don't use the R language for the assignments in this course, that class can get you in the right mindset for what kinds of plots and plot-layouts to put into a report to make the best use of your limited space.  Also, that course goes into some detail on logistic and linear regression.  While those topics are not covered in detail in this course, that discussion is still a good primer for topics in this course, including things like brushing up on rusty linear algebra skills and learning to do write vectorized code.",

Make sure you get started on it as soon as it is released.  There is an 'artsy' component to this class, where you have to deal with taking good pictures and then talking about how you took them well in the reports. Personally, I didn't like the subjectivity of it. \nThe most disheartening aspect of this course is that you must make up something to get more than 90% on any given assignment. What must you make up, you ask? That's a good question, as I am done with the course and still haven't figured it out. \nThe final exam was open book with two attempts, however it doesn't test that you actually know something. It's more of a needle in haystack search where you have to 'select all correct choices'. \nTAs were quite helpful throughout. Video lectures were pretty high level and didn't get into the meat of the algorithms, which made them relatively poor in my opinion. \nIf you are doing the Computational Perception specialization, you have no choice but to take this. If you have decided on any other specialization, just take Computer Vision and you would have covered a large majority of this course, with a much greater depth of understanding of the math and algorithms as well.

It is a disgrace to student taking time away from busy life and want to learn something useful. \n\nI hated this class with a passion. My final grade turned out okay so this is nothing personal. But boy was I disappointed.       \n\nThis is going to be long. Here’s the tl;dl: If you hold a business degree in either undergrad or MBA, definitely absolutely opt-out of it. You won’t learn anything new. If you can’t opt-out, perhaps wait until they rework this class. With the numerous very negatives I think they will have to do something about it.        \n\nHere we go…       \n\nFirst I should say I don't have a problem with learning accounting, costing, finance, marketing, strategy. In fact I still consider the very existence of business classes in the curriculum to be one of the highlights of Georgia Tech’s analytics degree program. But this class is just horrible. It has “Analytics” in the name, is one of the few (3?) classes created specifically for the analytics program (all others are existing classes from other majors). But throughout the class the professors hadn’t mentioned it even once, except perhaps the couple of times when they referred to us. They did not even attempt to relate the material to analytics at all. And it shouldn’t be difficult. I don’t expect them going into much detail on the “how” – that’s for the next class, but it should be very easy to at least mention areas of application. For example, in valuation there was this comparable method, in marketing there was market segmentation and evaluation of advertising. All have obvious links to analytics. They could have just spent a minute linking them to analytics concepts like clustering, design of experiment, etc. But nope there was none of that.        \n\nAnd then there was the teaching itself, which was a complete opposite of the awesome ISYE6501 where the videos were concise, to the point and easy to follow. This class had long (10-15 mins) videos where the professors were just reading from the scripts. A couple professors at least make some better PowerPoints slides, but the last professor would put a whole paragraph of text on the slide while he talk on and on. On the forum the professors (mostly just the main one since he was the one who interacted with us) were not exactly helpful. They could get impatient and defensive really fast. They probably thought we were either asking stupid question or trying to be smartasses. Their attitude really discourage learning. They could even get borderline rude. There was this one time when a student asked for clarification on one of the frameworks, and he would say, and I quote: \"Why don’t you google John Kotter read more about his approach\". Go figure.        \n\nEven worse was the homework and exams. For machine grading purposes, just about everything was multiple choice, with no chance of partial credits. You would be asked to do multi-step problems that involved creating a balance sheet or multi-year NPV calculation (by hand In exams!). If you made one single mistake you would lose all points – it could amount to a whole point (homework) or even 3 points (exam) on your *course* grade. Other non-math problem tended to ask about the tiniest detail of the material. There were also select-all-true (and sometime all-false! Better be careful!) from 5-10 boxes and again they were all-or-nothing. All of these made the homework and exams very stressful.        \n\nAgain, my grade turned out ok. But I just hated wasting 3 credit hours on this class when there are so many interesting electives out there. Avoid it at all costs unless/until you hear better reviews in the future.",

Experience in KBAI from last summer helped me wee little. Looking back, I should have taken CP class before KBAI. exam. My only criticism, is this class seems to bite more than we can chew at times, lectures are over-packed and at times. Video lectures sometimes become too much \"illustrative\", and some of the useful details seem to get left out, when the lectures say this is just for the illustrative purposes. And because of this, you might understand how something works, but might not always understand why something works. I loved the idea of Above and Beyond (A&B) in the assignment, it did seem to align well with the spirits of the masters' degree. If you are planning to go with CP&R specialization, definitely take CP before CV. I am coming from 6+ yrs of professional C# and .NET experience, but regardless, I definitely would recommend some good practice with Python, NumPy and OpenCV, bring down your workload. The assignments are not that hard, but they might seem challenging at times. I found the midterm project (Seam Carving) challenging. The class let's you pick your own final project, so you can truly make the most out of this class. Final exam was neither too hard nor too easy. Do read the question twice, in the final test. I expect them to lower the velocity. I did not always appreciate when the videos ignore some of the necessary details. Overall, stay consistent, do the the exercises, spend time reading the white papers. Take the time to read the white papers. there are a TON OF WHITE PAPERS TO READ, which might seem overwhelming, but do not forget you are a graduate student, at Georgia Tech.

He is basically what would happen if you had Donald Trump run a business class. The OMSA program and Georgia Tech should all do themselves a favor and just fire this man.  He is toxic. He is disgustingly rude. He is about as personable as the Ebola Virus. If you misunderstand any concept that is ambiguous in the class, it cannot possibly be his problem, it must be that the students are morons. Or the students just are not getting it. But it is never his issue, it is always ours. If we do have the audacity to say he has done something wrong, instead of admitting his error, he will double down on his wrongness. He gets unnecessarily defensive. I am in complete awe of how a man with such a disgusting behavior is any where close to an academic institution. This man is a disgrace and an embarrassment to Georgia Tech. He runs the class like a prison. He thinks it is better for the homeworks to be these all-or-nothing multiple choice questions that do not help with learning, but test what you have learned through the videos. I feel like he made this class unnecessarily difficult, purposefully. I think he has some deep-rooted Napoleonic Complex that he needs to get checked out by a psychologist.

            "text": "I came into this class with little or no background in Python, Machine Learning, or finance. There was certainly a learning curve in all three areas but the course did a good job of introducing the material so that even a newbie like me could catch on. The lectures on Udacity are well done. The assignments are solid and teach you a lot (be careful, often they build on each other so you can't just skip one and think you'll be fine). \n\nI had two issues with the course - 1) assignments weren't finalized until a week (sometimes less) before the due date. The professor would say \"you can use the old version to get started, not much will change\" but both times I did that I had a few hours of rework once the final version was released. I am not sure why a course that's as mature as ML4T can't get assignments finalized sooner, my three previous classes released everything well before the due dates. 2) Reddit was not a good forum for the course. My guess is that anonymity was a factor, some students were downright rude to one another. Other students asked really simple questions that were answered clearly in the assignment or syllabus. I wonder if having your real name tied to the post would have reduced some of that. Also, the threads got too long. I had two questions that never got answered (slack was helpful when that happened). Other times replies would go on the wrong thread and it was confusing to read. I have nothing against reddit, but it didn't seem a good fit for this course. \n\nAs for workload, some weeks I put in only a few hours, other weeks were more like 20 hours when a project was due. I was learning Python while doing the projects, so that may be higher than normal. Agreed with other comments that the midterm was tough to finish (I finished with maybe a minute left, and I'm normally a great test-taker). I finished the final with plenty of time, but several questions were ridiculously unconnected to course content. \n\nFinally, the tone of the class was a bit off to me. Some of the professor's responses on reddit were rude. I've taken other classes in the program where I felt like the TAs and professor really cared about the students and their learning. In this class I didn't get that vibe at all. ",

            "text": "This course was very informative, but required a lot of work on the projects and especially on the assigned readings.\n\nThis course covered a lot of OS principles, both historically and relevant to today's environment. It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.  \n\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area.  Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class.  Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven't been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\n\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could've been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\n\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts.  The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit.  The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\n\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\n\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded.  At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted.  This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus).  A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms.  I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\"  OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\n\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don't be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course. You'll learn a lot in this course, but you'll also work hard to do well and be glad you took it (after it's over).",

This class pairs well with other classes, as long as attention is paid to the higher workload in the last few weeks of the class.\n\nPROS:\n\n--Lectures were clear.\n\n--Professor Balch was active on Reddit nearly everyday.\n\n--The material was interesting and a good example of how machine learning is applied in a single industry.\n\n--There seems to be some measure of updates and improvements each semester, so there is an effort to refine the course over time.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n--The amount of lecture material is light, particularly in the second half of the course.\n\n--Management of the course was often sloppy.  For example, the course started a few days late, project requirements sometimes weren't \"finalized\" until a few days before the due date, important clarifications of project expectations were sometimes contained in a single post buried in the Reddit megathreads that were hundreds of posts deep, messages to the class were infrequent or incomplete, it was often impossible to submit a project to T-Square until two days before the due date, wording of exam questions was often vague, and the checks for course participation were essentially abandoned halfway through the course.\n\n--There was very little feedback on projects.\n\n--The grading was slow for some of the auto-graded projects and participation quizzes.\n\n--It was a challenge to search the Reddit megathreads that were often several hundred comments deep.\n\n--Professor Balch's tone on Reddit sometimes didn't come across as very encouraging.\n\n--Some of the additional assigned shows or movies (e.g. The Big Short) weren't at all relevant to machine learning.\n\n--The answer key used to score the final exam had two incorrect answers (Professor Balch eventually acknowledged one mistake, but stood behind the other even though it directly contradicted an assigned video).\n\n--Professor Balch's frequent references to Monty Python are distracting and could be confusing to those that aren't native English speakers.",

            "text": "Agree with most reviews so far. Better if you have some python experience and linear algebra refresher before you start. That said it does build up slowly on the coding side. It got very intense for me the last 4-5 weeks through the final trying to follow math (mostly linear algebra) I should have known once upon a time but probably didn't learn properly and would have now forgotten at any rate. Completing it and mostly following the math was very satisfying.\nThat said, the homework was reasonably easy to do without following the math, it was laid out step by step with the final destination not necessarily well in focus; I would actually have liked a bit less hand holding along the way (it was pretty much routine to get 100 on homework). \n24 hour exam format was a winner, it gave those of us who don't code for a living a chance to demonstrate what we had learned. The final question on the final exam was great; I wish there'd been a couple more like that along the way.",

But the best class I have ever taken. \nSomeone here said \"excellent pacing and length\" - totally agree with that. And Dr spool is a very engaging lecturer to boot.\nRecommend doing an intro to R to reduce workload in class. I got the equivalent of an A but the workload was especially intense the first 4-5 weeks as I had to cope with both the material and learning to use R. Admittedly I didn't use the office hours much, when I did tune in I found a lot of dead time between interesting bits and I lost patience. Stack overflow (and occasionally RTFM) to the rescue...\nBut to recap how I started, it's a fantastic course.\n",

This one is the most important and the hardest. Learn how to solve typical most common problems like LIS, LCS etc. Get Dasgupta algorithms book and start solving DP problems (chapter 6). Learn how to write a recurrence and pseudocode for them using pencil and paper! Once you are comfortable - go to leetcode, or hackerrank and practice them as much as you can. Code them if you want, but keep in mind that you'd have to be able to HANDWRITE your solutions!\n\n2. Learn about roots of unity in the context of Fast Fourier Transform. To be more precise - understand, how to multiply 2 integers using FFT Divide&Conquer approach. This one is also one of the most challenging topics. The lectures are good, but assuming you know the basics, which I didn't, so I had to dig all over the internet to understand it.\n\n(If you are good with 2 things above - you'll most likely succeed. Other stuff is also important, but not as much as previous 2. You'd still have to practice all of it, but other topics a bit easier to grasp.)\n\n3. Brush up on modular arithmetic, RSA cryptosystem and all the theory behind it.\n\n4. Learn the basics of the graph theory: paths, flows, spanning trees, DFS, BFS, SCC, Djkstra etc.\n\n5. Don't worry too much about proving problems to be NP-complete, those are fairly straightforward, although, practicing wouldn't hurt at all.\n\n6. Practice linear programming problems, but only after you are good at 1 and 2 (or if 3rd exam is approaching).\n\n7. Make sure you have enough time for the entire semester, and don't hope for the last night preparation. It won't work, unless you are already pro in all the topics above. \n\n8. Do all the homeworks, and do them EARLY!!! They are hard, although worth almost nothing in terms of grade. Doing them is crucial for quality exam preparation, and if you don't do them - you're screwed!\n\n9. Do not rush dropping the course if you screw up on the first exam. There will be plenty of opportunities to catch up, at last you can drop with W after the 2nd exam (if nothing changes next semesters).\n\nThe course is absolutely amazing, and it will develop your brain big time. The lectures are of the highest quality and very helpful. So, work hard, be optimistic, and good luck!\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

Listening to the weekly lectures and taking notes alone took me about 10 to 15 hours per week because I had to rewatch them several times to fully understand the topics. Doing the homework took about 5 hours or more per week. And, I spent about 20 hours or more per week to work on extra problems and reading. And so, on average, this class took me about 35 to 40 hours of studying per week. Can you do with much less amount of time? Absolutely! But it depends on a few factors. First, it depends on your goal: are you okay with a B (I'm not; I want my A)? I know some students who spent 10 to 15 hours a week, but were struggling to get into the B range or were solidly in the B range. Second, it depends on your background: are you familiar with the topics already (I'm not) or are you the brilliant type (I'm not; I have to work hard to get my As)?\n\nThe exams were hard but fair. They weren't tricky, but you absolutely need to be careful lest you'd make silly mistakes. But, from personal experience, and from what I gathered from Piazza, it was almost inevitable that people would make small mistakes, some of which had disproportionately large deductions, and so don't kick yourself too hard when you do make those types of mistakes.\n \nTake my review with a grain of salt. I'm the type who pushes myself very, very hard to fully master everything about anything, and I strive for the high scores in my classes, which I did in this class.",

The exams are similar to homework but home works are not easy either, But you will get a week to figure out for homework where as exams can be very tricky. The professor won't ask any questions that does not make you think. He makes you think a lot during the course. The professor gives a lot of good hints on what to focus on during exam times. They are very very important. Pay close attention to what he says. He is very active on piazza and answers a lot of questions. The professor is very particular about dynamic programming. If you do well in this area, you will get A or B. Otherwise difficult to pass. He asks tough questions of Dynamic programming. It is his favorite part of the course. He initially scared the class saying that if we don't do well n dynamic programming, we will not pass. That happened to be true. This class required at-least 30-40 hours of work for me. So, my advice is not take this class with any other course\n\nThe positive thing about the course is, the curve. The B cut-off was 65% and A cut-off was 84% for Fall 2017.

I learned about advanced C Programming (which I am not sure was necessary as part of this course). The other thing I felt very arbitrary was the extra points for the project work.

            "text": "I had zero ML experience, its been 14 years since I last thought about linear algebra, and I wasn't comfortable with any of the ML libraries(like sci-kit) before this course. Its a good course, lot more theory than I liked, but it helps you learn. Assignments are basically experiments and documenting the same with no clear instructions on how to conduct those and what kind of experiments to run; I think the idea is to encourage students to explore and learn as much as possible, so that we get learn to decide what is important and what is not. Assignment grading seems unfair at times, and exams are very tough(At least for me). Advice from me; refresh your linear Algebra, and be comfortable with Python/Java so that you can work with ML libraries. At least be in \"listen only\" mode in piazza, office hours, slack channel to get hints on what experiments to run, what curves to draw in the report (I didn't do it, and that was a mistake)\nYou will learn a lot. Do not stress yourself with assignment and mid term grades. I found that individual grading may seem brutal, but the overall grading is pretty lenient. Just hang in there, do your best, and try to enjoy while you are at it. Getting a 'B' (or above) isn't that difficult IMO. \n\nProfessor Isbel is really really really good and very active in Piazza. They have an army of hardworking TA's, and piazza is very active with discussions. Overall, a very good course. ",

The EER diagrams, schema design, and normalization content is useful. Read a book and don't take the course if that's what you're looking to learn. If you haven't done web development, you will learn a lot from the final project which is a web application. The database component is a decent component to the project, but there's a lot of unnecessary UI requirements. Many requirements are arbitrary and not relevant to the database (i.e. drop downs, radio buttons, printable pages, unit conversion).\n\nProject was terrible. It wasn't reviewed for accuracy or the actual technical requirements that students were supposed to get from it. It was refined over the semester, and felt like the instructional team was making it up along the way, which led to a lot of questions on Piazza. No rubrics were provided for the three project phase submissions. Grading is inconsistent. I had a great group, which made it bearable. Choose your group wisely and try to find others that can complement your skills for the project. There's a team formation period so use that time wisely to find others who are motivated and engaged.\n \nExams were fair for the most part. The last exam was pretty tough as some of the questions, especially calculation questions on indexes, efficiency, and performance weren't like those found in the book or sample exam. Still possible to do well if you think through it carefully. Be prepared for 1-2 questions that don't cover the content assigned in the syllabus. Be prepared for 1-2 tricky questions per exam that assess small details that aren't relevant or core to the course material.\n\nInstructors were not responsive. The head TA was pretty defensive in some initial threads which didn't create a welcoming or positive learning environment on Piazza. Many Piazza threads were never answered, including exam questions and project requirements. The instructor asked for feedback in the middle of the course (which many students appreciated including myself) after some students communicated about the negativity on the forums and the somewhat artful deception of the few exam questions I mentioned before. Most of those threads went unanswered even after the instructor said he'd follow up with individual responses.  \n  \nHope positive changes actual take place in future offerings. I'd recommend the class for those uninitiated with web and SQL. A lot of people already familiar with databases tend to not like the course.",

There's some opportunity to do that by looking through the library and peer-reviewing projects, but you need to make time for it. Really recommend doing that if you take the course because you might find something you hadn't thought about or that captures your interest more.\n\nI'd recommend taking this course towards the end of OMSCS as you might have acquired some new skills that you'd like to apply to an EdTech development project.

To be honest, I really liked the instructors and their teaching style. In fact, that is the only reason why I liked this class. I used to keep listening to their lectures again and again until the concepts got deeply embedded in my brain. The instructors provide the students with a good overview of the theory and derivations both through lectures and piazza materials, but the students are not tested on those in any of the assignments. The midterms and finals were not that difficult, provided the students get accustomed to the structure of the questions beforehand. One way to do that is to solve all assignments of the past Machine Learning courses taught at CMU as well as the exercise problems from Tom Mitchell's book that do not require any derivation or proofs. I did all my assignments in JAVA using Weka Library and BURLAP, although Python would have been a better option. Assignments were easy yet time-consuming. In most universities, Machine Learning courses offered by the CS department turn out to be a blend of theory, derivations, analysis and quality code execution, where most students are tested on those. Here students are graded ONLY on analysis. In fact, students are provided with the code or the software for all assignments. I did not enjoy the assignments, as I did not find those challenging enough. If the students are serious about understanding the lectures, then they need to ensure to have a basic grasp on Big O Analysis, Differential Calculus and Probability Theory before taking this course.",

The material is derived from an excellent textbook.\n\nUnless you've recently taken an upper level algorithms course prior or have a recent and strong math background, you will probably have to work hard to do well.  Some students could have used additional preparation before enrolling (e.g., their math background was extremely weak and hadn't even encountered high school level calculus or discrete math).  If you fall into that category, take a discrete math course or find some way to fill in those gaps.\n\nMy advice: don't underestimate the importance of the homeworks and practice for the exams.  Do all of the homeworks, all of the lectures, and stay current with the recommended course schedule (which can be demanding).  If you find yourself having an idle week in this class, you're likely doing it wrong.  \n\nDon't let students who comment about \"no formal proofs\" deceive you.  Usually, that \"formality\" is seen at the undergraduate level and you are expected to prove your claims on much of the material (and understand proofs given in the lectures).  For example, having an intuitive understanding of induction helps with dynamic programming problems and when you get to NP complete problems, those are proofs.  Either way, it's not something to be afraid of but rather to embrace as part of your journey into the core of computer science.  ",

            "text": "I found this course to be a good introduction to operating systems, especially having never taken an OS course before. Since this is now my 9th course in OMSCS I've certainly run the gamut in terms of quality of courses. That being said, I'd say IOS is one of the better ones (my favourite and best being KBAI) for the following reasons:\n- The video lectures are well organized, the concepts are explained clearly, and quizzes are thoughtful and helpful in reinforcing topics. \n- Instructor and TA involvement was exceptional in Piazza. They fostered a collaborative learning environment which helped bring learning above and beyond just the video lectures\n- The projects were helpful and fun to do. As rusty as I am in C, the projects were a nice refresher and departure from my usual day-to-day work in higher level languages. If you start early on the projects and get involved with class discussions, there's no reason you shouldn't succeed on the projects. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities that weren't hard to complete and ended up saving my grade. \n\nMy concerns with this class:\n- Exams: although mostly straightforward, they were tricky and sometimes required remembering one small lecture detail. The midterm and final exam weren't evenly split over lecture material with the final covering significantly more lectures. In this regard, I highly suggest that you keep pace with the class syllabus. \n- Grades: We received our project 1 and midterm grades back fairly quickly, but didn't get project 3 grades (which was due in the middle of the semester) until nearly after the final. Not having a good pulse on your grade was mildly frustrating. \n- Bonnie: Project submissions are handled through Udacity's testing framework, Bonnie, which had a few hiccups throughout the semester which were eventually resolved. I did like the instant feedback it provided. \n\nHow to succeed and other advice:\n- Keep up to pace with lectures, projects, and reading material. With regards to the reading material especially towards the final, I found that just focusing on the papers that were discussed in lecture were most important. There were some lengthier papers that, although interesting, contained far more detail and concepts than the class exams or projects required. \n- I bought the Silberschatz Operating Systems Concepts textbook but only cracked it open once or twice because the lecture material was complete in itself and Piazza was an excellent supplement for answering questions. I regret buying the textbook, but YMMV. \n- Invest time in setting up and understanding your C development environment. It will save you time in the long run when you're trying to debug a segfault. Use an IDE like CLion (free for students). It helps highlight syntax errors that you could otherwise miss. Learn the basics of vagrant (virtual machine), valgrind (memory leak checker), and gdb (C debugger). \n\nOverall I'd rate this course an 9/10 and would highly recommend it. It wasn't part of my specialization, but I'm happy to have taken it because it rounded out my understanding of basic CS concepts. ",

Even after reading all the reviews and professor's push, delayed to start the assignment and the price was paid in the assignment marks. I finished running all the experiments but didn't have time to write the analysis for which the assignment is graded. Write up is the key. Do not stress much on interesting data sets. Choose two data sets with different type of attributes, <30 in number and with <5000 instances. This will help in running the experiments faster and saving up time for analysis. Later I could score really well in rest of the assignments. Assignments constitute 50% of the grade. Midterm and final constitute rest 50% with equal proportion. Mid term was 1.5 hrs long and final was 3 hrs. Mid term is made purposefully lengthy. It had all T/F questions with 2 points each in the beginning for which a small explanation is required. Later there were 12-20 points questions. So time management is crucial for Midterm. Final had the similar pattern with double amount of time and it was fine. The exams do not require to memorize the proofs or complex equations but basic ones. I have used the following tools/libraries for assignments. 1. WEKA (Java IDE) 2. ABAGAIL (Java) 3. SCIKIT-LEARN (Python) 4. BURLAP (Java). It is better to start the assignment early and to get familiarized with the libraries. Its better to decide on the type of graphs to be produced and stick to them. I always got tempted to include more graphs but ended up not using them due to 10 pages space constraint. It is better to focus on important graphs and good analysis. Guidelines or sample analysis won't be available. It is better to read some papers and follow the format.

The grades come back kind of slowly, but as long as you break the problem down and model it correctly you won't have any issues. The video lectures are good, actually pretty funny because of the professor's interactions with the udacity person.

They were terrible.  They never answered the questions at hand.  It's as if they simply sought to get credit for answering questions in a perfunctory fashion, not elaborating on the answers beyond what was mentioned in class.  \n\nExams were tough in the sense that they required VERY specific memorization.  You couldn't miss an iota of information to get a decent score.  And the exams did NOT allow for partial credit, despite questions in the form of \"select the options below that...\"  So, if you don't know the 4 correct ambiguous answer choices, you don't get any credit.  \n\nThis course embodies not practicing what they preach:  A chunk of the course focuses on \"Strategy & Innovation\" and they preach about companies who couldn't adapt.

First, I have to state that Dr. Isbell, and the TAs: Amir, Sasha, and Pushkar, were extremely helpful throughout this rough journey.  This was a crazy semester for me, and I am sure for others as well, with the hurricanes that affected us: Irma and Maria.  I actually had to complete one of the assignments while running on a portable gas-powered generator, because the electricity was out at my house due to hurricane Irma; where there's a will there's a way.  With a wife, kids, full-time job, putting up hurricane shutters at my house and my parents, being without electricity for a few days, driving all over Miami to find gasoline and propane, and taking Machine Learning for Trading along with this course, this was one hectic semester.  In the end, I miraculously earned an A in both courses.  I must say that I learned a lot in this Machine Learning course, I came into it clueless about Machine Learning, and can say that I acquired a plethora of information in the end.  Dr. Isbell and Dr. Littman cover Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning throughout this course, at a somewhat deep level, which was great.  Grading is harsh, but don't let this discourage you, just give it all you've got and do not give up.  Complete all assignments and the problem sets, and study hard for the midterm and final.

They can be time consuming, especially the latter projects. Especially if you're not familiar or comfortable working in C and a Linux (or unix-like) environment. A lot of other students seemed to struggle with the basics of settings up the environments needed to complete the projects.\n* For midterm and final definitely use previous midterms/finals as study material. Most of the questions are derivatives of previous years, or sometimes the same just worded slightly differently.\n* Read the papers! Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos.  And read the papers before the lecture videos.\n* Final course grade is curved. Everyone seemed to do mediocre or not-great on the final and midterm exams, but doing well on the projects and completing the rest of the assignments will help ensure a good grade out of the course.",

The course is compared to a PHD in structure, not necessarily rigor, and I learned a lot about the academic development process. The strongest aspect is this class is the organization and communication which is led by Dr. Joyner. His planning makes it very easy to focus on the content of the course and if you do have questions, answers are swift and sincere. The format is unique in that you are assigned a mentor who guides you through the process of deciding on a project and fulfilling the requirements. There aren't any strong negatives in the course but I suppose the initial project dive is a little rough. There is just so much data to sort through and it is a little hard to pick the problem you want to solve. Fortunately, if you come in to the program with a problem in mind this is a non-issue!\n\nDifficulty:\nThis class is what you make of it. You could pick an really easy problem or a really hard problem, the only person you're hurting or helping is yourself.The first few assignments are almost entirely reading academic articles so get good at reading those efficiently. The writing is not that hard as long as you stay on point and have a purpose. My initial project idea was too ambitious but I was able to massage it into something that could be completed in about 100 hours which is the goal. \n\nWorkload:\nI spent a lot of time reading throughout the entire course so that never really goes away.

These lectures gloss over some details which force you to read the book which has moments of utility but is by and large, a jargon-riddled dumpster fire. The book uses some dreamed up syntax to express some of the algorithms which is pretty taxing to understand. The best approach is just to re-write the algorithm in code into you get the results you expect. The homework is very difficult because the questions are vague but expect precise answers. Fortunately, if you head my advice for dealing with the text book, you can use the same approach and produce code to solve your homework. You don't get credit for the code but it certainly make producing nice LaText and reduces the chance of you transliterating something in your process. If you can explain your approach, you might be able to retain some points but overall, the homework grading is very strict. The coding portion of the project is massive. Absolutely massive. I think it should have been split into at least 3 projects but that may have slowed the class down and there is a lot of ground to cover. I have no complaints about the project grading or what they asked of us. The project document is pretty vague and you have to interpret and justify a lot of your design decisions, just like in real life :)\n\nThe final was not fun and was pretty much like the homework.

The class covers a wide range of content but doesn't go enough in depth with any of them. The weekly programming assignments also seem to lag the readings a bit (you'll be doing an assignment in Lesson 6 when the reading schedule indicates Lesson 7 or 8). \n\nI don't even consider myself an experienced software developer and there was only a few things I got out of this class that I felt I could apply in the real world. I didn't get enough hands on experience with Android development to be confident enough to enter that field. I got SOME useful experience with black and white box testing which I liked. Other than that I got some Java experience and that's about it. There's an opportunity to get a little bit of project management experience if you volunteer to be the leader for the group project but the curriculum doesn't go into software project management. I do wish the group project was shaped to focus on a particular software development strategy (e.g Agile, Waterfall, etc). I also wish there was a project on refactoring as the lesson material covered that but the projects didn't.",

The programming assignments are graded on how fast they run on a high-performance computing cluster. The course material covers parallelization on a shared memory system, distributed computing, and cache performance, and I felt like the class provided a good general intro to these topics.\n\nDr. Vuduc is clearly a passionate educator. He's good at illustrating many of the difficult HPC concepts. The lecture videos have high production quality. The class was well organized and the Piazza/Slack interactions were engaging.\n\nCSE 6220 was my first OMSCS course. I knew it was going to be challenging, but it was harder than I'd hoped. I found the midterm and final to be difficult and grueling. The exams are mostly theoretical / analytical while the labs are obviously practical. There seemed to be a disconnect between these two components of the course. The harder labs took a large amount of time, and I'm not sure how much additional time/energy would have been required to do really well on the exams. That said, if you do well on the labs, you can still get an A even with middling performance on the exams.\n\nI took this course to fulfill a foundational requirement, to challenge myself, and to get exposure to HPC. I came into the class with some light experience in C. I had to spend a lot of time on the labs wrestling with C issues that a more experienced C programmer wouldn't have. I also didn't have strong algorithmic analysis background, which made it difficult to follow some of the analysis portions. Overall it was a hard but good course.

I had heard great things about learning from Dr. Isbell and I was not disappointed in the least. It was an honor to learn from him and Dr. Littman. These professors genuinely care about how well and deeply their students learn. If you take this course you will learn a lot and if you want good grades on the assignments, you will work very hard. Each of the 4 project assignments took me 35-40 hours. My advice is to start on every assignment early and truly learn from the feedback the TAs give you on them. The assignments are pretty open-ended and they want you to do more than the listed requirements but also do it concisely, so a lot of your time on the assignments will be editing and making sure you cut out fluff and use your words wisely. Also do all the problem sets they make available. You'll want to get started on these early too so after discussing solutions on Piazza, you can fully understand the answers before the midterm and final exams. Also, don't use this class to learn an obscure tool. Use the tool most of the class uses because the instructors don't care about which tool you use and you won't earn extra points for using something unusual or poorly documented. The benefit of using what most students use for each assignment is that you can spend less time implementing the work and more time writing your analysis which is almost all they care about. Tools more common among your fellow classmates will have more troubleshooting solutions on Piazza. This was my 5th course in the program and it was probably the hardest I've ever worked for an A in a class but now my brain is packed full of knowledge about Machine Learning and I look forward to taking Reinforcement Learning, especially because it's taught by the same professors.

The class was a good introduction to a lot of OS concepts, and gave a decent survey of more modern concepts that many would consider to be application or domain-specific (e.g. data centers).  The material was lopsided in that the final part of the semester was much more in-depth than the beginning, and hence the final exam had many more pain-points of memorization than the midterm.  The projects were very illustrative of the concepts (I wish we'd had project 2, whatever that was) and didn't fall into the trap of being application-specific.  Strongly recommend C programming background, familiarization with GDB, and (probably) a solid understanding of the Linux filesystem and make paradigm.

            "text": "Overall a great class and a must take for the first semester. As all great things it did have its ups and downs.\n\nIn this class you will learn about: processes and process management, threads and concurrency, scheduling, memory management, inter process communication and various sync constructs, i/o, virtualization, remote procedure calls, distributed file systems, distributed shared memory, and some datacenter technologies.\n\nYou will get to implement a multithreaded getfile client/server, proxy, cache, and play with an RPC (this semester's was Sun's RPC) think how awesome all of these would look on your resume, also you'll be able to answer all of the AOS prereg question list https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf. If your goal is to eventually take AOS, HPC, HPCA then this class would get you in great shape for them.\n\nThe lectures are great and require no outside readings to understand the material, professor Ada was very active on Piazza and held office hours regularly, and the TA's were friendly and very responsive on both Piazza and Slack. \n\nThe tricky part of the class were the exams, particularly the final which had more material than the midterm on it. So I suggest you study hard for it. There are some (few) papers to read through, but you can get through these fairly easy as there's few and concise.\n\nKEY to this class is to make sure you start the projects on time, the first project in particular is trickier than the others. The more time you spend on it and the better you do on this first project will be worth it in the long run. For each of the projects you have about 1 month to complete which is more than enough.\nI didn't do as good on this first project, because I started it very late, but managed to do good on the last two. So even if you don't do as good on the first one don't fret, you can still do great in the class!\n\nSome C will be good to know coming in, but I think that if you work hard you can pull it off with minimal knowledge, you just need to attack that first project really hard. If you're familiar with pointers, double pointers, function pointers, and using typedef and structs, then you're golden. If not then take the Lynda.com C classes (comes free for students) or grab the K&R C book and go through it (there's also a k&r c solutions book that can be bought for the solutions for the exercises) you can get those for under 20$ if you look hard enough, but just understanding the aforementioned will be enough and wouldn't take more than a few days of stack overflowing and testing on your own to get.\n\nMake sure you're on Slack since Day 1, you can learn a lot about the projects and get hints on them by lurking in the channels. This semester we had a PAID Slack workspace thanks to one of the TA's, how cool is that? To top it all this semester there were some pretty funny characters on it which made lurking enjoyable, however there's always the usual troll tho in there, but hey it's still a great resource.\n\nTL;DR: Just go for it; great class, doable/rewarding projects, friendly/active TA's, very active instructor, very C, such Threads, many Science, WOW.",

Do notice that each project is tagged as Easy, Moderate, Challenging, and Very Challenging. That's based on Professor's own experience, and MAY NOT suit your case. For me, the hardest project is manual_strategy, which was labeled as merely Moderate, while the Very Challenging one feels like a breeze. So, don't assume the time it requires for each project has a direct correlation with the difficulty labels. You may put yourself in an awkward situation. \n\nAnd regarding the exams, you'll need to answer 30 multi-choices within 35 minutes. You might argue about the limited time given, but trust me, it's perfectly sufficient to finish the test. I completed the Midterm & Final within 20 mins, and I still got 10 mins to go through each question before submitted it. No hard calculation, just concepts/ideas and shrubberies. If you could not answer it within seconds, I highly doubt that you could get the right answer out with more time given.\n\nOverall, if you 1) are interested in learning financial strategies, or 2) want to apply the ML approach you acquired to investing, or 3) need a intro-class before taking Machine Learning, I highly recommend this course.",

Its only weekly once during the office hours he answers the questions\n2. Coordination miss between the head TA and another TA (this TA was scarcastic & harsh in the response).  There were only 2 TAs as the size of the class is < 50.\n3. When you post private questions on piazza on how to proceed for a question in homework, the TA hardly cares and makes it public and waits for other student's response which you hardly get. So it remains unanswered till the due date of the homework. \n4. The homeworks don't cover all the pieces that you read. Few of the concepts won't be tested and the last homework was a copy from the lecture slides\nThings l loved \n1. The textbook prescribed. Sometimes you get that AHA-AA feeling.\n2. The project.

The only thing difficult about this course, speaking only from my perspective, is that a couple of the projects took me a substantial amount of time not because of the security related topic but because to complete the assignment it required knowledge of the project environment that I had absolutely no experience with; e.g., in the last project dealing with web vulnerabilities you have to work with Javascript, which was completely foreign to me, so I took more time learning about Javascript than figuring out the vulnerability.  Outside of the projects, I averaged 2 hours a week on this course to cover lectures, textbook, quizzes and exams.  But factoring in the time I took on the projects which soaked up a lot of time, it bumps my average way up.  They give you about 4 weeks for every project, so if you are not a procrastinator like me you should be good.",

            "text": "This class is no joke. I had to rearrange my life to have enough time for assignments. You actually program the AI projects that you learn about in lectures. Note that my Python (and especially numpy) skills are at best average, although my statistics skills are good. Fellow students were very helpful on Piazza. Don't forget about Slack, too.\n\nAssignments: Some of the assignments require really strong math skills, most require a decent understanding of probability theory, and all require good Python scripting skills, including numpy.  There were 6 assignments in the Fall 2017 class; you get to drop the lowest grade. The assignments are auto-graded and you get multiple (from 5 to unlimited) attempts to submit the assignment and you know your grade for that assignment immediately. I really liked that. \nExams: take-home exams that take 10-20 hours to work through. Exams actually promote learning the material that wasn't part of the homework, so I liked that about them. Make sure to ask instructors any and all questions you might have. Don't try to get what the question is getting at, or you'll lose all the points for the question. \nGrading: The class is graded on a curve (median and above is A, one stdev below median is a B) but note that the median for most assignments was 100% (midterm and final were much lower, around 75%). For the online section, A ended up being about 87%, and a B was about 74% . Don't bypass extra credit questions if you have the time to complete them (some are very time consuming and others aren't). As the class progresses, you might not be able to complete an assignment, so extra credit on an assignment might be the difference between A and B, or even passing and failing. \n\nOverall, this was a great class, one of my favorites in the program, along with KBAI. If you actually have the prerequisites outlined, you'll spend much less time on it than I have and probably enjoy it. ",

This class gave an introduction to Machine Learning topics as well as stocking market concepts and in a final project, allowed you to create a market trading strategy that was powered by one of several algorithms you learned in class.  The course used Python and was light in a coding from my perspective as a software developer.  If you were not a coder, getting up to speed with Python and Numpy will take a fair amount of time.  Thankfully, as is becoming a trend in OMSCS courses, most of the assignments have grading scripts so you know the majority of your grade by the time you submit your assignment.  There is the caveat that reports require manual effort to be graded and occasionally, there are additional test cases the TAs use that are not included with the grading scripts but still fit within the specifications of the project.\n\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable class that was fairly graded.  There were two exams that were worth 12.5% of your grade each that were 30 questions in 30 minutes.  As you'd expect with that format, you must be a quick reader and thinker but ultimately know the concepts very well to do well on the exam.  For those that overanalyze or how to think through each exam questions, you will struggle on this kind of an exam and while the exams are not worth a large portion of your grade, you do need to perform decently to get an A in the class.\n\nAs with most classes you enjoy, the Professor makes the class what it is as the instructor lectures on Udacity are extremely engaging and entertaining while also being brief and informative.

If you are planning to take two courses then this should be the \"difficult\" course and then other one should be \"easier\" of the two. \n\nI was able to get an A in the course and did fairly well but this course is a very hard course. Like others have mentioned the difficulty of the course has changed over time. The last \"sensor-warehouse\" assignment was apparently an extra credit assignment till last semester but from Fall 2017 has become compulsory assignment and is 20% of the course therefore if you do bad on it then it could affect your grades significantly even if you might have been scoring more than 90% up untill that assignment. \n\nThe TAs are super helpful and they encourage students to share their solutions and learn from each other. Almost all assignments can be solved in multiple ways both taught in the class and otherwise. \n\nFinally, having said all that I think this course is fantastic (but hard). Knowing what I already know I would do it again. I did this course with Intro to Information Security, but if I were to do it again I would do it as the only course as the learning outcome would be much higher. ",

The great things are the lectures are engaging, the assignments are relevant to industry, and the course staff was engaging on Slack and Piazza.  The things needing improvement I felt were the assignment count and one or two questions on the exams.    The first assignment and the third assignment were both rather difficult so you want to get a start on those as soon as you can. The fourth assignment was not as difficult so that was a great time to take advantage of the extra credit in the class. If you bomb the hard half of project 3 like I did, you're going to have a hard time bringing up your grade for the remainder of the course due to the lack of assignments .That's unfortunately enough to sink you with assignment 2 gone.   However, with the curve, its still rather attainable to get a B (I received a B).  The exams were rather difficult and tricky. Most of the questions were fine. I felt that one or two of the questions were cheap shots (obscure details in papers that aren't immediately obviously applicable to industry /historical ).  I went over the videos over and over again but honestly still didnt do very well here.  Definitely focus on understanding the details in the assigned papers and don't put the papers off until after the assignments were due like I did (this was a mistake).  All in all, this course wasn't that bad from a difficulty perspective for being a systems course. It'd probably be a good fit as a foundational class for you.",

Worked as an electrical engineer in power distribution between now and then. Full-time online student currently. No formal software analysis and test training in academic or work environment. This was one of two courses that I took in my first semester. \n\nCourse Experience: Overall, the course was worthwhile from my personal background. The instructors and TAs are truly excellent in operating the course and helping the students understand the material. The assignments are very effective in teaching concepts and new tools. All horror assignments alluded to in previous semesters have been removed. Some tools were specific to academic research and not necessarily widely used in industry, which may not be beneficial for some students. Everyone had to fight through the difficulty of obscure environments and languages. I had an abnormally large and painful learning curve for most assignments due to my deficient background, hence the 25 hours a week. Five different languages used throughout assignments, but I was able to figure out the appropriate usage of each given enough time. Once you endure through the learning curve, you realize the simplicity of the coding for all but one assignment that required a specific algorithm that I hadn't implemented before. The concepts and analyses are relevant as well. The exams require application of the knowledge rather than simple memorization. For example, given this type of analysis, find the output of the given simple code rather than recite the definition and characteristics of an analysis. I gave a \"liked\" rating as the lessons I learned on the assignments and exams were truly valuable but often cost me 20% or more on my grade, which can be a difference in a letter grade. Then again, one should have to earn an A. ",

This class introduces a broad and limited understanding of computer networks topics. This is not a course that will teach you about writing code for significant network applications with SDNs or otherwise. The instructor was largely absent which made for some easy extra credit discussions. The TAs were very helpful and effective and made the course successful. Only one assignment out of eight had a significant issue that didn't effect grades for anyone. Exams were simple memorization of concepts from the lectures and papers. I earned an A in this course even without the extra credit so I'm confident the vast majority of students would be able to given enough time to figure out the harder projects.

The head TA, Stacia, ran this course like a tight ship and really made it worthwhile. The other TAs were helpful and responsive as well. Communication was frequent and regular.  I found the content itself interesting, having familiarity only with the basics of TCP and a high-level understanding of internet architecture. I think I would have been fine without any prior knowledge of computer networks. The first few projects are designed like coding challenges in Python. They were challenging and I really enjoyed them, but they seemed to be a headache for people not familiar with Python or OO programming who took to Piazza to vent regularly.  The later projects were less time intensive and more about performing a set of trivial tasks and then analyzing the results against what was presented in the class. Some people got lost in the trees on these, more Piazza venting.

Though it requires a good amount of work to be done for projects and assigned readings. In fact I am glad I did not pair it with any other course.\n\nThe course covers the OS principles, its history and its relevance today. It’s pretty interesting to know how latest technologies of virtualization and cloud have its basis on principles from the 80s and 90s. The videos explain the topics well and have assigned papers for further readings. I must have only managed ~30-40% of those (some 40+ papers are provided at the start of the course.) The midterm and final questions are not MCQs and require some memorization as answers are to be given in bullet points/essay form. However the previous year papers and solutions are quite helpful in understanding the pattern. From lectures and previous year papers one tends to figure out which research papers are more important from exam point of view, though others are equally important from a learning perspective. Midterm and finals are 42% of the total grade. Grades are based on a curve. \n\nThere are 4 projects to be done and they require good C/C++ skills (C for projects 1, 2 and C++11 for projects 3, 4). Even with knowing C++ for last 9 years, the projects were not easy. Project1 was quite difficult, with many test cases to cover and Project4 required writing a lot of boilerplate code(~40 hrs of work, 1000+ lines of code). However all the projects were interesting and offered something new to learn.\n\nProf. Kishore is a great instructor who teaches very passionately and the lectures explain the topics very well. Office hours happen once every week. I could not attend any live but videos are recorded and shared for later viewing. The TAs are also pretty responsive and helpful, I was pretty surprised that they accepted my request to reassess my midterm solution.\n\nOverall it’s a great course with lots to learn (you would not be writing your own OS here if that's what you are expecting but you will learn a lot about OS principles, virtualization, distributed systems etc.)\nAdvise to anyone who is interested in taking this course - be prepared to work hard, DONOT start the projects late, brush-up on C/C++ skills if you are not using it on daily basis, it would not be easy learning it on the go. And try to follow the schedule provided for watching videos, I missed the schedule after the midterm exam as I was employed more than full-time at work and I had to slog a lot towards the end.\n",

The advantage is that you can easily understand the concepts, but the disadvantage is also obvious that you don't understand where these concepts come from and you have no idea how to practice them when facing a complex problem. The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy.  Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions. So, overall, how much you learn from the course is based on how much extra work you paid to this course. One bad side of this course is that you either receive 100% or 0% for project or homework, so a lot of students will receive above 95% for the overall score. So the cutoff for A will be most likely 90%.",

The exam questions had alot of vagueness and felt were not written that well. The second complaint is that while the TA's were good about answering Piazza questions they were not so great at answering followups on Piazza. A followup question many times has as much meat as the original and kept seeing followups marked as satisfied when they clearly were not.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the class for the material and the projects were a blast and interestingly challenging. Only project I didn't enjoy as much was the virus analysis one. All the rest were really fun and cool. These was the best part of the class. I disagree that the class was super easy, I found certain parts hard and the projects always took some level of cleverness to solve.

You should get it for the course as a reference and for the exams but don't plan on keeping it.  \n\nThe exams are not difficult but are not easy to get an A.\n\nI like the concept of the project because it demonstrates \"putting it all together,\" but the Fall 2017 semester version was not well executed.  I think the TAs and instructors are taking feedback appropriately to improve it in future semesters.",

Prof Isbell wants you to understand the topics, not regurgigate reports or pay too much attention to coding.\n\nRegarding coding, you can use whichever programming language you want, but there are some recommended languages for some assignments.

I expected this class is for OS internal and it is partly correct but it spends much time on concurrency problem (a process and a thread) while it is still very fun.\n\nI felt the latter half of lectures are bit dry, and because we don't have hands-on experience on them (memory management, file structure, spin-lock, hardware related subjects, and memory sharing) through projects, it was bit difficult for me to understand and absorb all of what I was taught.\n\n20 hrs / week is just average and I always tried to complete a project as soon as possible, so after a project is open, I spent 70-80 hrs / week and after I completed it, I go back to lectures and spent 10-15 hrs /week. I recommend the same way if you don't want to be upset at the last moment...\n\nExams were not so easy, you should expect they are more complicated than sample problems. However they kindly offer a check list you should review before each exam, so by checking all of them, going through all quiz on lectures and sample problems, I think you can be ready for tests.\n\nAnd if you want A, you should definitely try to get all extra credits.

The lecture content is somewhat dense at times but Ada does a great job of explaining concepts and I found her lectures extremely useful. There are two exams that are certainly tough but you only need to study the lecture material to do well on them. I'd recommend reading the assigned papers but the main concepts from them are also covered in lecture and I didn't bother to re-read them while studying for exams. This approach netted me above average scores on both exams which largely contributed to my A in the class.\n\nThere are three projects whose difficulty will depend on your familiarity with C. I came into the class with no C experience and definitely had my struggles on the first project, but I managed to power through it and felt far more comfortable for the rest of the class. Despite this I'd caution against taking this class with little/no C experience unless you consider yourself a strong programmer, otherwise you may be in for a rough ride. The first two projects are both difficult and time consuming and I would start them as early as possible because you are going to run into issues with C/Bonnie/etc along the way. If you manage to get through those you'll find that the last project takes significantly less time. The good news is that you have access to the autograder (Bonnie) for all projects so you generally know what grade you're going to get when you turn the project in. I put significant effort into the projects and got full points on all three, though I know students got docked minor points for poor READMEs and other small things.\n\nYes this class is hard and you're going to get frustrated during the projects, but your efforts will be rewarded by a solid foundation in operating systems and you will no longer fear C.",

            "text": "Amazing course as an intro to OMSA or for anyone willing to get a broad understanding of Analytics concepts and techniques with R language.\n\n- Content-wise, I have found this course very condensed, there is definitely a lot to learn. The online format of the course is very succinct therefore additional readings definitely help in building the intuition. To do so, I have relied on various books, sites and blogs, but also used the discussion forums which are definitely a key to success for this course. This course is greatly designed and the knowledge acquired after finishing this course is definitely its strength. \n- Logistics-wise, on average one homework per week is to be submitted, the difficulty varies based on the content of the course, I have spend 8 to 10 hours a week between the course and the homework. The peer-grading can be frustrating at times, but equally rewarding when receiving a feedback on the submitted homework, which is not necessary the case. The weight of the homework in the overall grade is quite low compared to the level of effort. However, the time spent on the homeworks is useful to prepare for the midterms and the exams, which are more concept-based and of average difficulty.\n- Prerequisites-wise, elementary knowledge of R is definitely helpful to focus on the concepts rather than wasting time learning the language in parallel. Dedicated office hours will also help with R if required. Basic knowledge of math is required but the course is not deep diving into complex math formulas and theorems, which made it easy from that perspective.\n- Course team-wise, the course is provided in the perfect format, appropriate for online learning but still ensuring the quality of traditional academics. Real-life or project examples are shared by Dr Sokol with a pinch of humor throughout the course, which makes it very captivating and interesting as well, beyond the theory. Last but not least, the TAs are VERY present and supportive, which contributed a lot to the success of the cohort.",

            "text": "I took this as my very first OMSCS course by itself, and it was the perfect choice for that.\n\nOne of the TAs described this course as \"a whirlwind tour through Computer Vision\", and I think that is a very good synopsis. It focuses on \"classic\" (pre-deep learning) computer vision, though there is a final project option that uses KNNs. The lectures are countless (after I completed the first one, I thought I was done for the week, but then I looked at the syllabus and realized it was only one out of five for the first week) and dense, so you get a thorough understanding how each presented method works. Not much fluff or handwaving going on here, Prof. Bobick will explain the algorithms and the math involved in detail.\n\nThe problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but also well-designed and motivating. At the end of each of them you'll have something quite impressive to show to your friends or co-workers. About half the problem set points are awarded by the autograder, and the other half comes from the report which mostly consists of images and/or video generated by your code. So if you get all the points from the autograder, you're almost guaranteed to get an A. So the outcome of the course is quite binary: either you don't \"get\" the material or your coding skills are insufficient and you drop half-way through, or you're able to complete the problem sets and get an A or B (the exam being the wildcard). Speaking of the exam, it was open-everything and unproctored, but still quite challenging. The assignments are only released one at a time, so front-loading is not really possible. On the plus side, everyone is working on the same stuff, so the collaboration (on Piazza) is better.\n\nIn terms of pre-reqs, make sure to brush up on Linear Algebra (you should at least know what a system of linear equations is, for example). A little bit of Computer Graphics knowledge is also helpful, but not required. I did Pryby's \"Linear Algebra Refresher\" on Udacity in advance, which taught me Python and Linear Algebra at the same time (without numpy, which I picked up during the course).\n\nIf you have a full-time job, I would definitely recommend not taking a second course with this one (unless maybe if you're a numpy master who does singular value decomposition in his head for fun).",

He is very active in Piazza and slack and gives you meaningful feedback, and detail on why he does what. During this semester they tried a new grading scale, where for projects A's were all 100%, B's were 80%, C's were 70% and so on, meaning that there is no way to get a 90% or a 85%. I didn't really like this because it seemed to penalize borderline work IMO. \n\nOverall this class was a lot of work. It wasn't technical but there was always something due. I felt pretty overwhelmed after a few weeks of trying to balance two classes. I am not sure if this was always the case, but I felt that the previous reviews were sort of a lie.\n\nGreat class but lots of writing and work. ",

However, even without an undergraduate degree in programming, I was able to power through the course and get a B.  It isn't impossible, but it isn't easy.  The ideas make sense, it's just putting them together that takes a while.  Also, having had no prior exposure to Bayesian statistics really hurt me.  If at all possible, I'd recommend you study that topic up pretty good before taking since it represents a major cornerstone of the course (and it isn't immediately intuitive).\nJust for those who don't know the difference between AI and Machine Learning (that was me!), Artificial Intelligence is not making computers that think for themselves.  It is much more focused on finding clever hacks to make a computer work faster and more efficiently to arrive at a difficult (to compute, but obvious to humans) answer.  I later realized what I wanted was more under the umbrella of machine learning or reinforcement learning, but alas!  It was still a good class even though it wasn't exactly what I wanted.",

            "text": "Class is all about TAs, no professor interaction. Not an issue, but set expectations accordingly.  \n\nGood to have some idea of linear algebra and calculus. Not a must, but helpful. Also, Python programming experience, particularly with numpy, will give you big head start. If you are not comfortable with those the optional programming work leading up to your first quiz is a good way to ramp on the Python & numpy piece. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, my understanding is this class became more difficult starting Fall 2017. As a consequence, instead of being a likely A with relatively low effort it's a likely B. I expect an A, but have done a lot of work to secure as explained next. \n\nOf the course's 7 assignments, 6 are setup that you can reach a maximum of 90% following directions. The remaining 10% - referred to as Above & Beyond (A&B) - requires that you do something else of your own invention related to the assignment. TAs will give suggestions or hints, but this is where you can easily spend 90% of your time and learn the most. Meanwhile keep in mind it's only worth 10% of the assignment grade. \n\nMidterm was difficult and saw 10-15% of the class drop. Implement a selected research paper. Took me more than ~ 60/hrs to do it. Very interesting work however, the sort of thing you'll probably want to share with prospective employers for instance. Mean average was a high C and counts for 12% of your overall grade. Final Project is expected to be of a similar level of difficultly - excepting you choose your research paper to implement for better or worse. \n\nFinal exam is a pain. You get two attempts, 2.5 hours per, and will need all of it. And Notebook quizzes are hard. I expect the Notebook quizzes to improve next semester. The Final Exam however is something that's been used for several semesters running so prepare for aggravation there. \n\nThe Slack channel for the class is very active and was by far the best part of the class. Piazza meanwhile got very noisy with repeat questions. \n\nFinally, get a tripod for your phone or camera if you don't have one. You can get a cheap one for ~ $20. Makes a big difference on several of the assignments. ",

            "text": "I think the course covers a lot of great materials and some of the projects were insightful but I was disappointed to find that the Projects at times provided no instructions, at times were graded in an arbitrary fashion by TAs and required an awful lot of time (one of the programming projects required nearly 30-40 hours a week if you have beginner or intermediate programming experience).  I have to really highlight that NO instructions were provided.  For example in one of the projects we were required to utilize a well known security tool and you were graded on your implementation of that tool, but no instructions or examples were given and that left some students wondering why they didn't just invest the money in taking a class to learn that toolset from another provider.\n\nIn my case I had to drop because of the time commitments (I work 40+ hours and run a business on the side) and because after getting As on other projects and assignments I received a terrible score on one project and could not recover.  Unfortunately, although I had put in 60 hours of work in and I could demonstrate the logic in my code was correct and met stated requirements, the TAs provided no credit on account of how they expected it to function (requirements that were unstated and undocumented).  Truthfully I received so little feedback and so few instructions that I withdrew in part because I realized I would learn more with my time and money spent elsewhere (ex: CCNA).\n\nAlmost considered dropping the program altogether (I felt the University misrepresented the coursework as something you could maintain with a full time job) but I decided to try another class and see how it goes.  I am also considering leaving work for a couple of months and may attempt the class again during that time.\n",

            "text": "The good:  \nThis was the most practical of all the courses I have taken.  You use modern compiler tools, assembly code, optimization techniques that can work for any program, and the stuff about parsing is almost exciting.  Ever write a program that got too big to manage?  Parsing and Intermediate Representations is the answer.\n\nThe bad:\nThe course is run entirely by the TAs.  The instructor does not participate.  You may get lucky, but my TAs were horrible.  They may be very nice people but they cannot teach.  Their English is not the greatest, and the questions they ask are vague and ambiguous.  Without exaggeration, every assignment and project was riddled with typos or mistakes.  And not little ones.  We're talking missing verbs, references to variables that don't exist, output examples being wrong, unstated requirements, or just bad English.  \n\nIf I were to give examples I'd be here all day.  A very simple example is being asked to re-write some code.  I added two lines.  It fulfilled the requirements, and it worked.  I got 0 credit, with the explanation 'Instructions say to rewrite'.  Submitting a regrade request led to more points being taken off a different question.\n\nThese TAs seem incapable of understanding ambiguity.  Depending on how you ask for clarification, you will get conflicting answers.  I tried reducing all piazza posts to yes/no questions, and even then they answered 'yes' to 'can I use string concatenation' and then marked points off for using string concatenation.  Stuff like that, all the time.  If you don't give the exact answer they expect, regardless of whether you met all the requirements or not, you fail.  They are very strict and do not appear to read your explanations.  I think they suffer from TL,DR syndrome.  Considering most of the questions are about invented, imaginary grammar, it's impossible to prove your point to them.\n\nSame thing for projects, with the added complication of partners who went through the same confusion, asked the same questions, and got different answers because they asked a different way.  The lectures are about generic parsers, and are unrelated to any actual work, which made things worse.  Try convincing your teammates that both the TA and the lectures are wrong.  Not gonna happen.  So you stop pushing commits to Git, because they keep changing your code, you end up doing all the work yourself, are accused of not being a team player, and then as time runs out they end up using your code in the end because you knew what you were talking about.  This actually happened to me.\n\nIf you don't care about your grade, and can handle nonsensical feedback/scores, you will learn some practical stuff.  Otherwise this course will make you question your sanity.",

            "text": "Pros: Interesting material! Since it's a domain-specific course (focused on healthcare), we're constantly exposed to real-world applications of the technology. This includes current and historical challenges, and new opportunities. The course incorporates a fun group project working with an external mentor (from the healthcare industry) to create a FHIR app that might actually turn into something. (I cringe at all the throwaway code I write for an OMSCS course, so this was a refreshing change.) The TAs are super responsive and I was delighted how fast the assignment grades came back!\n\nCons: This semester the course has been significantly reworked. The lectures are new and autograded activities have been created from scratch. There were a few hiccups with the activities, but the TAs were always quite responsive and graded generously in these situations.\n\nMisc.: Students are expected to write numerous short-form essays (200-400 words), citing sources using APA format. This was new to most of us, and the TAs were helpful in getting us familiar with it. The autograded activities required Java code written to interface with a FHIR server. If you're learning Java while also learning the FHIR API, expect a few weeks of pain.",

            "text": "The overall presentation of this course left much to be desired. The professors could have been replaced with books and supplementary powerpoints and the course would have been more effective. Instead, we have topics consisting of a string of 20-minute videos of powerpoint readers that, on average, contained the efficacy of prescription-strength Ambien on a warm summer day. Few, if any, of the topics had anything really to do with Analytics as we can expect to use it in real life, and caused students to wonder who was paid off to make the class required. Towards the end of the class I found myself both 1) not learning anything and 2) just trying to score enough points to finish the class...which brings me to grading. \n\nOn grading, there were questions present on homeworks and exams that could have been based on information that wasn't in the printed notes, but touched on during lecture for about five seconds. When lectured on in detail, some of the presentation methods could be construed to be contradictory (or flat-out wrong in a couple of cases) and required confirmation in the human-led sessions. When it came time for the exam (or sometimes even the homeworks), god forbid if your flashcards or whatever memorization method failed you in that time period you immediately lost 1-4% from your final grade. \n\nOne could argue that every part of the class design achieved the needs and objectives, and full disclosure the final score was a mid-B. But looking back, I've completely forgotten some 80% of the course material and paid some good money only to have for three credit hours and traumatic memories to show for it. If Dr. Jayaraman's argument of a happy customers being the most important part of a business's survival holds true, this class needs a complete overhaul to deliver a more positive, conducive learning experience.",

Weeks without projects were pretty tame, but projects could be fairly time-intensive.\n- Success on projects was highly non-linear.  For most of them, your solution either worked or it didn't.  Points were awarded for individual test cases that were all fairly similar.  The instructor-provided test harness provided examples, so you weren't totally in the dark, but testing wasn't done in a cumulative fashion where each successive piece of code was built on a previously tested piece.  You've got to construct your own tests and debugging process, but hey, that's life.\n- The lecture content and especially the projects are deep-dives into filtering and path planning.  This is core stuff, but doesn't include the breadth of concepts involved in automated cars, much less robotics generally.  There was no machine vision or reinforcement learning content.\n\nOther Notes:\n- 100% Python\n- No group project, voluntary or otherwise, unlike some previous semesters\n- Taking 6601: Artificial Intelligence beforehand isn't required, but probably helpful\n\nMy grade: A",

The projects are not a wash and require a good time investment.\n\nIt's been my largest class with 500? people I think, which leads to the one drawback - it's difficult to stay on top of the Piazza threads and participate meaningfully.

I have never been interested in anything remotely related to finance, so I was slightly concerned about whether or not I would enjoy this course. Professor Balch does a great job explaining the finance content without assuming any prior knowledge about trading. I've actually had conversations with coworkers about day trading thanks to what I learned in this course. It is practical!\n\nI found the projects to be enjoyable throughout the semester. They do a good job of building upon each other as the semester progresses, and they're balanced appropriately. The two most difficult (time consuming) projects were spread throughout the semester. The midterm was fair and shouldn't be too challenging to anyone that stays on top of the course content throughout the semester. \n\n**Major pro**: all assignments for the semester were released in draft at the start of the course. This allowed you to work ahead if you knew you had scheduling challenges coming up during the semester. \n\n**Biggest con**: Although the projects built upon one another, we often had to copy and paste code from one file into another. I would have liked the different files/classes to interact with one another a little better. That being said, though, that's a pretty minor con. \n\nThe coursework was never insanely difficult, but it did a great job providing an intro to some ML and RL concepts. I'd gladly take this course again and certainly recommend it!",

I wrote 5 hours/week here but I am not sure how much it actually was, since I basically just completed every assignment the weekend (day) before it was due.  The group project was the only thing that required scheduling, but if you have a good group like I did then it's not a problem; plus it was an obscenely small % of the total grade.  The periodic assignments, class participation, and peer feedback was a large percentage, and they were very manageable.\n\nThis class went through the motions hitting all the key beats, but focusing mostly on UML class diagrams and state charts.  It then touched on and required us to generate behavior diagrams and a deployment diagram.  There were periodic assignments requiring various diagrams to be generated for various designs, and then there was a group project.  The group project was based on a scenario described in a prior assignment, so the initial work consisted of reviewing the group members' class diagrams and code and combining all the best parts (or picking someone's who got a good grade).  All of that was fine.\n\nThen there was a surprisingly large amount of coding.  It was my first time having to write Java in 10 years or so, and I was surprised, considering design can 100% be done without writing code.  Either way, as you can see from my rating, it was pretty easy overall, but I would just be warned that there is significant coding required.  Also the videos were weird; I didn't think they were bad at the time, but having taken a couple more classes since I can see they weren't great.  Also, they didn't always have anything to do with what we were actually generating for the assignments and the project, but the state chart ones were OK.",

Just be aware that the <a href=\"http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Spring_2018#Assignments_.26_Grading\">assignment descriptions</a> are verbose so it is easy to miss a detail. I think improving communication regarding the assignments could save time for everyone by reducing the noise on Piazza.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this course.\n",

The grading was generous.\n\nCONS:\n1. You better learn about registers and memory on your own because it is NOT covered in the least. A lot of times is spent on parsing, regex, languages, etc. and zero time is spent on the technical part of a compiler.\n2. As another reviewer said, the course is run mostly by the TAs. When I took it, there was one very vocal TA in that they were active on Piazza and Slack, but their answers were TERRIBLE. When I realized this, I tried phrasing my questions as yes\\no or as multiple choice, to try and steer them towards actually answering them, but never did they just give me an answer! \n3. The professor participated in office hours, but had no idea what the current homework was. He would be asked a question and would have to look at the homework as if it was the first time he's ever seen it. The homework had plenty of typos and ambiguities.\n4. All the answers, from the professor and the TAs were always so laconic. This is an online class based mostly on text. This is a place to answer in full sentence and elaborate, or else what is the function of having a class vs. just having lectures?\n5. The lectures are very general, so not very helpful for the homework and the project.\n\nThis class makes all other classes I've taken before and after seem like a dream.",

            "text": "I think I disliked ALMOST everything about this course. The lectures were very understandable (too understandable) but kind of long (for the content), the book is just ok - often a savior though, the quizzes sometimes are unexplainably difficult considering the lectures they are attached to, and the assignments are just something else. \n\nIn very short, my main complaint is the amount of material crammed into this course. This course could have easily been broken into at least 2 parts, one probabilistic (Bayes nets, decision trees, others) and one deterministic (A*, constraint programming, adversarial search etc). Unfortunately, with everything thrown in, some stuff will suffer (and is unfortunate, most of the stuff is worth studying more carefully). \n\nA second complaint would be about the lectures. I had a hard time taking them seriously, most of the time prof. Starner and assistants try to paint a relaxed and jokey/fun atmosphere, in some sort of popularity contest style. Laudable try, but unfortunately it made the lectures lack the rigor they needed, which proved a problem for assignments. It was impossible (IMO) to approach any assignment with the lectures only, which presented a problem in itself - if one puts 3-4h/week in lectures, just to have to read another 3h from the AI book, that makes the lectures kind of useless. And one needs all the time possible for assignments. \n\nDon't want to insist too much, but various other things added to frustration: fighting Bonnie (with its arcane errors) for assignments, fighting with TAs about solutions for mid/end term exams, the grading on the curve (\"is it enough a 90% to get an A, when most assignments have 100% as median???\"), opening the course with \"adversarial search\" instead of with actual \"search algos\", and many other small issues. \n\nMaybe I'm too biased already, I would recommend people buy the AI book and study it at their own pace. A lot cheaper and a lot less frustrating. ",

The projects build on each other, which is cool if you feel you have a good grasp on the project and a good way to solve it, but if you don't have a good approach at first, you could potentially need to do a lot of refactoring.

The class eases students into development the first few weeks by giving several introductory individual assignments at the beginning including a review of github, Java and Java testing. These will be a breeze for anyone who works as a software engineer already, but gives a nice review and catch up time to those who aren't. Thus, if you aren't a software developer you have a few weeks to ramp up. The group project was perhaps the most time consuming part of the class and also my lowest grade in the class. Overall, the group assignment was not so difficult technically, but the struggle of my group was procrastination by 2 members such that I didn't have time to review and fix what they worked on. The white box/black box testing assignments near the end of the term were interesting, though highly academic and theoretical. Overall, this is a great first class for the OMSCS program, especially if you are already a software developer. The class will also keep you on track with set deadlines and assignments coming out at manageable intervals. ",

Later you learn Q learners and dyna and use that to the trading problem for the last assignment. Although you get a choice to use some earlier algorithms learned in the class, most end up using Q learner to solve it. It is advisable to learn some Pandas and numpy as they are used extensively throughout the assignments. I had a tough time using pandas for plotting graphs but managed it well in the end. Learning how array slicing works will help a lot. Also learning how to vectorize will shave some secs off your run time and you get bragging rights in slack and piazza for this. Make sure you are active on slack and piazza as tons of great advise are given by some great minds in the class. If not for slack, I would have struggled to understand and approach the problems on my own. And finally, the TAs in this class are a complete joke. You are assigned a specific TA and the one I had did not show up for the Office hour. Barring a few TAs, most don't help much and just ridicule you on Piazza if you ask something obvious. Having said that, I liked prof Balch's humor and approach. He supplemented the udacity videos with some youtube videos and that helped greatly for solving the assignments. Overall a great class.

The lectures are simply a mish mash of materials. Just a bunch of concepts thrown in.\n3. The TAs are not very active. The ones that are provide confusing and sometimes contradictory answers. \n4.

His answers are very indirect because he doesn't want to spoil the process of a student figuring it out for themselves... the end result being that the student never figures it out. \n\nThere are no prereqs to this course but if you don't come from an engineering background then you will be at a disadvantage during the first half and then completely lost in the second.

I can say it is one of the best online courses I ever did. The instructor is very passionate and very knowledgeable and the assignments are challenging but you end up learning a lot.\n\nYou will learn a lot about D3, and some bits about modeling and Big data technologies, but you will get a good general picture of what a full data pipeline project looks like.\n\nThe presentations are very enjoyable and well crafted, and you will make some friends thanks to a group project that will require at least 4-5 meetings. \n\nAll this said, this course could be improved on some aspects, one of which is time management and a bit more of hand holding. So don't underestimate the amount of time you will need for it. There are 4 BIG homeworks, so don't procrastinate and work steadily, if you do that I estimate around 20hours per week.\n",

I was expecting a deeper understanding of these concepts, as well as may be query optimization which are extremely relevant in today's world of distributed computing. Instead, the course spends inordinate amount of time on ER diagrams and ER modeling, which are outdated tools. Nobody uses them in the industry for any real world project.

However, the project itself isn't too hard. Even a single person can do it. The struggle would be with coordinating between team mates, if you end up with a bad team.\n\nThe reason I say you cannot Front load the work is only because the team project will only move at the team's pace.

OS concepts was something I wanted to learn out of OMSCS. This course provided a nice introduction to these concepts, at least to a point where I know where to look for for more information. It is not as detailed as a standard OS course at a top-tier school, though. For example, in my undergrad school, I know that CS majors had to actually write an OS from scratch as the project for this course. This course only requires us to use some of the OS features to implement some applications. This course covers a breadth of information in an easily ingestible way. But it does not go deep into any of the concepts.\n\nBasic knowledge of programming is absolutely necessary. If pointer, references and SIGSEGVs scare you, this course is probably not for you. You don't need to be an expert in C, but you need to be comfortable developing small applications, and with basic debugging. Nothing you can't learn in ~1 week if you already know Java or another equivalent language.\n\nThe instructor, Ada, was fantastic. The lectures were very well made. Ada was available in Piazza to help out fellow students. The exams were great, the TAs were always prompt. All in al, a very well-organized course.

Although I took it in a full semester, I think this would be better as a summer course because there were about 4 \"down\" weeks in the course where I didn't do anything. \n\nThe projects span a wide range of topics, but are very manageable. I thought the 1st project, Buffer Overflow was the hardest if you don't have background in C and memory architecture. The 2nd, Malware Analysis, was very straightforward. The Cryptography project was also fairly easy since you don't have to write your own mathematical algorithms unless you really want to. (So you can make it more challenging if you desire by not using libraries.) Finally, 4th Web Security project definitely seemed very hard for those who had never done any web development. If you have encountered JS/HTML/PHP, it is fine. \n\nThe Canvas quizzes are worth 20% of your grade and open book. So basically, 20% of your grade should be 100% right off the bat. The exams were a bit more random/tricky with some material included that is barely even covered in 2 sentences in the book. I read most of the book, but overall I probably won't retain much since the book is dry and topics are quickly covered. I somewhat regret spending time reading since I don't feel I walked away from the reading with a really deep understanding, but rather with a surface level acquaintance with terminology to pass an exam. I'm sure I will forget all the specialized terminology within a few weeks, hopefully the general concepts stick though. \n\nOverall, it was a fun course.  ",

            "text": "This course is effectively two, so must be reviewed in two parts:\n\n* Part one is taught by Dr. Eric Feron, who is a GT professor. This is the far better of the two course parts. The homework assignments and projects are well-defined and fairly straightforward, if divorced from the content of the lecture videos.\n\n I honestly did not even watch the course videos for the most part, and found them tangential at best to the tasks you're asked to complete. The actual videos are produced well enough but lack any kind of context or narrative thread, so it's very easy to just let it go in one ear and out the other without retaining anything. The Udacity course also commits an imho cardinal sin by embedding multiple videos on a single lesson section and consequently disabling auto-play (which goes back to the aforementioned lack of narrative thread). Ultimately though, as I noted before, this isn't a huge deal because the lecture videos aren't particularly useful -- in fact, the few instances when I did try to reference them to clarify something in an assignment I couldn't find anything pertinent.\n \n The homework assignments varied quite a bit, starting with basically some short Q&A/essays on cyber-physical systems, then going into basically a homework assignment solving a physics 101 problem (calc-based physics 101, to be clear), and then some minor coding assignments in C around black-box testing and input-output feedback loops. The essays required a day or so of work to compile, but neither the physics quiz nor the coding assignments required more than a couple hours work.\n\n Both projects involve commanding either one or a set of [GRITSbots](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/2014/11/the-gritsbot/) to accomplish a set of specified tasks, subject to a set of specified constraints, in a MATLAB [Robotarium](http://robotarium.gatech.edu/) simulator. You also have the opportunity to run your code against live robots in the Robotarium for the first project, which is neat but also frustrating, because you're only allotted two attempts in the actual live environment, and will likely find that your robot does not behave live as advertised in the simulation. This is not an issue for grading though, as you are provided a data set to use if needed for the analysis portion of this project, and are graded for code based on the results of the sim and not the live result.\n\n Both projects should be completable with a dedicated weekend of work.\n\n If the _entire_ course was just Dr. Feron's course, I would've probably rated this class \"Neutral\" with an \"Easy\" difficulty. I don't feel like I really _gained_ much from it, but the assignments were for the most part entertaining and it's elective hours.\n\n* Part two is taught by Dr. Jérôme Hugues, who is effectively \"on-loan\" from the Institute for Space and Aeronautics Engineering, part of the Université Fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées. He is highly credentialed and active in the CPS field. But don't for a second be fooled into thinking that implies he's effective as an instructor in this course.\n\n As Dr. Hugues is French, there is a language barrier to be overcome for the predominantly Anglophone demographic of the OMSCS program. His lessons and assignments are of course delivered in English -- you don't need to learn French, of course -- but his spoken English _is_ heavily accented and difficult to understand, and his written assignments often lack precision.\n\n Whereas the assignments for Dr. Feron's portion of the course were well-defined and had explicit questions and/or objectives, Dr. Hugues' assignments were exclusively _extraordinarily_ vague and open-ended questions, as though he's attempting a Socratic descent into teaching the material. That works _great_ in an open classroom setting where students and mentor can collaborate on exploring the topic. It is not at all appropriate for a graded assignment for which you're only allowed one submission.\n\n As another review noted -- and I don't know if this is just a cultural misunderstanding or actual personality -- Dr. Hugues can also be quite brusque when you attempt to ask for clarification. He often declines to answer questions outright, asserting that it's deliberately vague so that you can decide how best to answer (but how can I answer when I don't understand the query?).\n\n It could just be that I am not a smart individual, and certainly some students in the class were able to complete his assignments, but for both of them I found myself completely lost and in the mindset of \"I understand the individual words you've used, but I can't put them together into coherent entities that make sense in my brain.\" I've spent days trying to dissect his project and still don't understand what it is I'm intended to do. I suspect that, given Dr. Hugues' background, he just assumes a _lot_ of systems engineering background as common-sensible, which is probably a valid assumption at his home institution with his home target audience, but _isn't_ valid in a computer science course that has, at best, only an informal prerequisite of anything of the sort. I sure as hell don't, and I'm suffering mightily from it.\n\n It is worth noting that Dr. Hugues' portion of the course does not begin until _after_ the drop date, so Dr. Feron's portion can easily lull you into a sense of false security about where you stand grade-wise. With a _perfect_ score in the course going into drop day, I'm now basically assuming zero credit on all of Dr. Hugues' assignments and hoping I can perform well enough on the final (I think I can, since it is, I believe, prepared by Dr. Feron) to maintain a C.\n\n Consequently, for Dr. Hugues' portion of the course I would rate \"Strongly Disliked\" and \"Very Hard\" in terms of difficulty: I have learned nothing and gained nothing but frustration from it. I _do_ think that if you were able to surmount the language barrier, expand this to a full course on its own merit, and assume less in terms of prerequisite knowledge, this _could_ be an effective course. But absolutely not as it currently stands.\n\ntl; dr: Take this class at your peril. If you have an EE or systems engineering background you're probably going to be fine. If you don't, or have never worked on cyber-physical systems before, this is probably not an appropriate first course. (No, [6263](https://omscentral.com/courses/CS-6263) is not ample preparation.)",

I approached the Office of the Dean of Students, they checked the supporting medical docs and forwarded my absence request to the prof. SImulataneouslY I made a private post on Piazza, asking for an extension (2 wks) of a P1 (a deadline had passed before). A TA asked me to fwd a message from the Office of the Dean of Students with a statement that after I do this, they would approve my extension. I did what I was asked for and nobody replied anymore. Tried to remind them, tried to escalate to the prof., no reply. I ended up withdrawing from the course (1st time in the OMSCS, after 7 courses passed with As).",

            "text": "<b>EDIT 2:</b> Project 4 grade received on May 4 in the late morning and apparently I was not suspected of cheating.  A simple update on Piazza could have saved me, and probably many others, a lot of stress.  I still stand by everything else I said below in the original review and edit 1.\n\n<b>EDIT 1:</b> As of May 4, I have to downgrade my review from \"liked\" to \"neutral\" due to some stressful communication issues.  We were told on May 1 that all project 4 grades were expected to be returned later that night.  Also on the night of May 1, we were told that the instruction team found out some students used past projects on GitHub to complete project 4.  After this, the instruction team basically fell silent with very little exception.  Like many others, I don't have my project 4 grade yet.  I didn't cheat on project 4 or at all in this course, so the fact that I have neither my grade nor even the smallest relevant update from the instruction team is getting very frustrating and making me anxious, especially since it's now been 2.5 days since we heard anything relevant.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  My mind is racing at the thought of all the ridiculous hoops I'll probably need to jump through to fight a wrongful cheating accusation, and it's causing a lot of unnecessary stress.  Take this course with caution.\n\n<b>Original review:</b><br/>\nThis was a great course and was not too demanding. There are 10 open-book quizzes, each worth 2% of the grade. Almost every question is verbatim from the textbook or lecture notes. There are two closed-book exams worth 10% each. They were on par with the quizzes in difficulty, maybe a little more so since notes weren't allowed and they covered more material. The final exam was not cumulative. There were four projects, each worth 15%. The projects were some of the most interesting and fun I've ever done in CS, as an undergrad or grad student. We had about a month to do each project, which is <b>way</b> more than necessary. For that reason, IIS is a fantastic course to pair with another course.\n\nProject 1 is all about buffer overflows. Knowing C helps a bit but is by no means a necessity. It's probably more important to know about internal memory architecture at a somewhat high level. This project was definitely the most time consuming for me, and I think I can objectively say it's the one with the most amount of work. (P4 might be more work if you have literally no web dev experience.)\n\nProject 2 is about malware analysis. I'm not that interested in malware but I still enjoyed working on this project. It was a massive decrease in difficulty and workload from project 1 also. No programming required for this project; it's all with a tool in a provided VM.\n\nProject 3 is about cryptography. This one was awesome. Some basic cryptographic algorithm programming in Python. Previous knowledge of Python will absolutely be helpful, and even if you don't there is plenty of time to learn it before the deadline. A ton of guidance is given and a lot of the code is already provided.\n\nProject 4 is about web security and exploiting XSRF and XSS vulnerabilities, and doing an SQL injection. This one was extremely easy if you have previous HTML and JavaScript experience. There is some PHP code in the files we're provided, so it helps to know that a bit. But if you have previous programming experience then understanding the PHP code will not be an issue. Also, the only code we actually had to write ourselves for this is HTML and JavaScript.\n\nReally cool stuff. The textbook is dry AF and probably the worst part of the course. The lectures were so-so but informative. Mostly absentee professor on Piazza, but seriously, who cares? We learn material from the professors' lecture videos, not from their Piazza posts.\n\nI definitely recommend taking this class. If you're lucky, your Piazza forum will be filled, like it was this semester, with highly entertaining posts from people constantly whining about the dumbest things, largely because they can't read/follow instructions or they need some serious hand-holding and spoon-feeding.\n",

Still ended up with a high B in the class since I did well on the projects up to that point.  Just stay on top of your stuff and you'll be fine.\n\nI loved this class and absolutely recommend it.

            "text": "Love, love, love this class!  A very gentle and applied introduction to ML.  It also teaches you NumPy and pandas from scratch.  There is a lot of info about this course publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/.\n\nThere are 8 projects in the class, and for the most part they increase in difficulty as you go along.  The first two were almost nothing; they can barely be classified as projects.  But it makes sense because they're supposed to serve as introductions.  All of the projects were very interesting and fun to do.  I have no previous ML experience (except for some basic boosting/bagging from CV but that was hardly a decent exposure, as much as I enjoyed CV) and that didn't hurt me in this class at all.  It was so cool in the final project to program a trading system based on machine learning and look at the results.  Code is tested on real stock data from real companies with some made up companies thrown in every now and then.\n\nAll of the project info is available ahead of time (see the link above) with the caveat that everything is in \"draft mode\" at first and will be \"finalized\" later.  For some reason this was a huge problem for some people in the course.  They refused to start until the project was finalized, which is kind of stupid on their part.  We were told repeatedly not to do that and that any changes made would be minimal.  The biggest change that I remember is in the second project.  We had to optimize something different from the previous semester's students.  Aside from that I think one or two other projects had a minor change and all the others had literally no change.  People blew this draft mode thing way, way out of proportion.\n\nThere is a proctored midterm and a proctored final.  Both are closed everything.  The final is not cumulative.  The midterm was extremely easy and was almost a regurgitation of previous midterms.  It sounded like that won't always be the case.\n\n3 textbooks.  One is required and is co-written by the professor.  It's fairly cheap (especially for a textbook) and is a pretty good read.  You'll definitely want it for the midterm at least.  The other two books are Python for Finance by Hilpisch and the ML book by Mitchell.  I can't remember if those two were actually required, but I didn't find them completely necessary.  The lectures were enough.\n\nIt's often said that a finance background is helpful for this course.  I think what people mean is a trading background, not a finance one.  I have almost no finance background but I do have a relatively extensive trading background, and that helped a lot.  I think manual_strategy would be the most difficult for people with no trading background since it requires an understanding of technical analysis and indicators.  This stuff isn't too difficult, but it is a lot to learn on top of everything else if you're new to it.\n\nThat's kind of true of the course in general.  It's not that this material is difficult, it's just that there is sometimes a lot of work in a short timespan.  If you have a good background in Python or trading then it'll be less work, of course.\n\nThis is a good first class if you can get in your first semester.  Also, this course potentially pairs well with other courses, depending.  I paired it with IIS and had no problems.  If you have no Python background and no trading background then I don't recommend taking it over the summer.  But, I do recommend this course in general overall.",

I had zero experience with both Pandas and Numpy and still only spent 5-7 hours every week. I also enjoyed the finance theory aspect. It made me appreciate the finance side of things more than I thought I would have.\n\nThe course itself will teach you not a lot new if you know even a bit about ML. The Q Learning RL project is interesting but is dealt with at a basic high level. I wish we spent more time on reinforcement learning.\n\nThe trading part is basic for an ML course focused entirely on trading. Yes we build some technical indicators to trade on but don't expect to learn anything cutting edge for finance. No Deep Learning. No discussion on high speed algo trading strategies. I wish we were trading in a simulator in real time for our final project or at least had a Kaggle final project. That would have been cool.\n\nThis is a good course if you're looking to get your feet wet in ML/Python but if you already took AI, RL and ML then it can be redundant. I recommend taking this course early on in your OMSCS career before you venture out to the other ML classes as it will be good prep for some of the harder courses.",

The examples and explanations are well-chosen and clear.\n\nThe individual assignments are good, but I think there's too many of them. All assignments are writing assignments with ~1200 words. I felt like I was jumping through a lot of hoops each week to complete all the assignments. I like the P Assignments on design (P)rinciples better than the M Assignments on (M)ethods. It's a fun course overall, and it gets you thinking about how people interact with technology in the real world.\n\nLots of required readings. Questions on the exam cover lectures and readings. I recommend taking notes on the lectures and the readings since exams are open-note.\n\nLike all of Dr. Joyner's classes, the communication on Piazza is well-organized and constant. The course hums along smoothly. The grading was a bit slow this semester, but many TAs fell ill or dropped off which is understandable.\n\nDefinitely recommend this course!",

Prior to this class, I had no experience in Python or visual processing so I chose to implement the verbal method for Project 1. However, I regret going this route and wish I would've jumped into the visual method right away. I found that when I switched to the visual method, I was able to finish coding my project in < 10 hours whereas I spent well over 3x that amount of time trying to account for all the edge cases in the verbal method. \n<br>\n<b> Lectures: </b> The lectures were very interesting in the beginning! However, towards the end, the topics seemed to overlap quite a bit so I started to lose interest in them. \n<br>\n<b> Assignments: </b> The writing assignments were definitely interesting and allowed you to be creative in developing solutions for real-world AI problems. However, a common complaint among the class is that there was a larger focus on well-made diagrams as opposed to technical writing ability. \n<br>\n<b> Exams: </b> The exams also required a large amount of writing (2k words for midterm, 3k words for final) and had ambiguous rubrics, which was frustrating because our responses were largely up to our interpretation of the problems presented. <br>\n<b> Teaching Staff: </b> The teaching staff was great! Professor Goel is pretty active on Piazza, and the head TA (Yan) was generally quick to respond to any questions we had. Grades were consistently returned 2 weeks after submission, with the exception of Project 2 and 3. This was because they included opportunities for \"recovery credit\" in the regular project and also normalized the grades for alternate project with the regular project to keep the class average fair.

            "text": "**Important note:** I took another course which was very time consuming (not GA) as well while I was taking this course, so that may influence my view of this course as well. And just for you to know I had taken more than half the labs of  this course and all OMSCS ML-related courses before day 1 of this course.\n\nDo you want to learn Big Data? OK, then take the best course or MOOC you can find online or offline or start some coding by yourself. Don't take this course. That's my best advice. Why?\n\n- **Professor is almost never around.** This is perhaps the biggest issue, and from my point of view, where all the other problems come from (he just doesn't see what is going on). You don't see him around in Piazza and he doesn't respond emails. I've been in other very few courses where professor is never around, but this course takes it to the next level. He participates with teams when it's time to start the project though. I can attest that.\n- **It's outdated.** They use spark 1.3 in virtual environment for homeworks. Latest spark version by the time of this writing is 2.3. So, it's mainly focused on RDDs, which is being left behind in favor of DataFrames. You can still use DataFrames in spark 1.3, but it's not mature enough. The same happens to other tools used. Some of the tools are not even the most used tool of their type out there. So sometimes you feel like you're learning it for academic purposes mainly or to get the grade. Having to give almost 40 hours every week to something like that can be frustrating.\n- **Feedback takes a long time to arrive**. There were times I had to wait a lot to get an official response, way more than other courses. TAs do this, I don't remember having seen professor do it.\n- **Fighting against environment**. They give you an environment you have to set up at the start of semester. It's good help, but you'll end up fighting that environment the rest of the semester.\n- **So much work is worth very few points**. 4 Homeworks take lots and lots of hours every week, but they are worth 10% of the whole grade each. Only 40% of the grade after 8 weeks of no social life, maybe 200 hours of work or more (each homework is given 2 weeks).\n- **Forget you had a family.** Your family will miss you for the whole semester. If you have a spouse, he/she won't be happy you decided to take this course.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is one of the **most important subjects for Machine Learning Specialization** because of how often you are asked to know this stuff for a job, and I liked the fact that GT had a course on this. I waited to have a good amount of ML knowledge before taking it, and I think the intention is good, but this course needs a revamp desperately and a professor with time well spent on Piazza.\n\nThis course was way too hard, and half of it was because of the wrong reasons (getting environment to work correctly, lack of documentation, lack of lecture on subjects needed for homeworks). \n\nI think they are thinking in improving this course, hope they do. I could have taken 2 other courses in the time it took to finish this course.\n\n",

I mentioned the books.  I never once opened them, but I got an 'A' in the class.  I've no idea what is in them, but clearly it wasn't needed.\n\nBy far, the best part of the course are the projects, but that isn't much of a compliment.  The things are terribly designed, require janky industrial software (seriously, why is industrial software so terrible), and have unclear requirements.  Once you've figured out what you are being asked to do, however, the projects are simple and can be finished in an hour or two.\n\nBeware the exams.  They are easy (like 5-10 minutes easy), but there is often misleading wording to questions.\n\nIs this an easy class?  Yes.  Does it require much thought or time?  No.  Will you still be sad you took it?  Very much so.  \n",

They are very open ended, and the steps to complete them are left to the student to figure out, but generally speaking, you know when you've got it right thanks to well defined completion criteria or provided test data to compare against. The first project requires GDB, which I'd never used before. If you're comfortable with debugging in any language, this should be no problem. Knowing JavaScript, HTML, DOM, and some basics about how the event model works in a browser is very helpful for the last project. The weekly quizzes actually help learn the material because you can take them over and over. I took them at the beginning of the week, then looked for the answers while reading the text and watching the lectures. Then you can get a 100% by taking it again at the end of the week. There are two proctortrack exams that follow the same true/false and multiple choice format of the quizzes. They are not difficult, but some of the questions are poorly/awkwardly worded in a way that was frustrating. Getting the text book is required as many questions for the quizzes and exams come from the text and are not explicitly covered in the lectures.",

This is a security course and they did well to teach that on these projects.  \n\nI didn't feel like I learned much from the second project other than I don't want to be a malware researcher.\n\nThe quizzes, book, lectures, and exams are all just ok.  Maybe because I'm not in the security field, but I found the material and how it was covered to be pretty dry.  Given that this course is highly relevant to our every day lives, I felt like the academic material could be more engaging.  \n\nOverall, I'd suggest this course for a student without a cyber-security background.

            "text": "CS-6262 is my first course at GaTech (online), and the course was disheartening. I was very motivated and wanted to excel. I watched every single weekly video and read all suggested materials. I took many notes and was very serious. However, this course is a complete pleasantry. Let me explain.\n\n1) The weekly videos are someone reading the slide without giving any content. The slides are extracted from whitepapers and mostly just the first paragraph of each subject. The videos do not explain; they give outlines of many topics.\n\n2) Each week has too many covered subjects. It's tough to understand everything with the lack of material. Whitepapers are not clear, long to read and a lot of additional web research is required. Videos took me about 1h on average to consume and white papers about 10h. The remaining time was invested in projects.\n\n3) Projects are not related to the lectures. In fact, the projects cover one topic of about 30 discussed in the three weeks the project cover.\n\n4) TAs only answer project answers. Several questions about whitepapers were never answered.\n\n5) Projects are not well constructed. Lots of information are given during the timeframe of the assignment making people working late on the project with a considerable advantage. Some projects requirements were written over +70 PowerPoint slides.\n\n6) Quiz answers are all available on Internet. \n\n7) Final tests are made to trick you. Many questions were related to a subject seen, but the question was touching an area not covered by the lecture. You had to know about the subject deeply to answer. The final exam had many errors (English and structural).\n\n8) Projects worth the most in this course. 5 of them took between 20 to 45 hours to complete. Spread over 2-3 weeks per project it becomes a burden with the whitepapers and videos. The two combined explain why I have an average of about 22 hours per week.\n\n9) Prof Lee is entirely absent from this course. The TAs are doing their best, but they are swamped by assignments questions which prove the lack of cleanliness as well as the disconnect between the material and the projects.\n\n10) They mention buying a book (200 pages). After reading half of it, I realized that it was a waste of time and money. There was a single page that was barely usable for a single project. A student asked about the book and no TA, neither the professor answered about how important was the book was for the class.\n\nIt was my first course, and if GaTech is running this way, I'll stop. The quality is deficient of this course, and it is evident that there was no real intention to teach anything else than cramping a lot of subjects in little time to make it hard. I do not see the point. I put the difficulty to hard only because of the lack of cohesion between the assignments, the lectures and the project. The content is not hard per say, but it is built to make you fail.",

There are 6 opportunities to earn points throughout the entire semester, which leaves very little room for error. Additionally the exam questions are full of opaque wording and seemingly arbitrary distinctions. Some questions ask you to select all the potentially correct answers from a list many options with no credit for partially correct answers, a decision which is truly baffling to me. \n\nThe instructor is responsive on Piazza at least, however that doesn't make up for the fact that the course is bad. Take your vitamins and power through it if possible. Make sure you're on top of your game on the homeworks and especially the two tests since they account for 80% of your grade, or else you may get a second crack at it when retaking the course. ",

The projects are a great way to learn more about how things really work and I do highly recommend that you steal code for this class rather than writing it from scratch (yes this is allowed and encouraged for this class). It'll save you a lot of time and gives you more time to play around and write your actual analysis (which is basically the entire score for your projects).\n\nThe lectures are great for me at least, but I do know of a few people who did not like the banter between the two professors. The extra readings, while not necessary, I believe is a great supplement to the lectures. Do read them to expand your understanding but is not really needed for the tests.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n** AS OF SPRING '18 THIS IS BOTH AN II ELECTIVE AND A FOUNDATIONAL COURSE **\n\nA fine class from Dr. Joyner, who stayed involved throughout and should be a model for the profs in other courses who basically let their TAs run the asylum.  10 weekly assignments,  one individual and one group project, two totally open book tests, and a 'class participation' grade (point for Piazza posts, peer reviews, and participating in surveys by other class students).  You are assigned three student papers at random weekly to review; these peer reviews are likely the least effective thing in the course with many of your fellow students offering a whole sentence or two as 'feedback'.   You also have 3-5 required readings each week which reinforce the Udacity lectures (well done by Dr. Joyner, updated frequently).  There is no programming required.\n\nThe basic course structure entails learning the principals and methods of HCI, with weekly assignments being split between the two tracks.  Assignments are used to demonstrate a grasp of concepts prior to the projects which put you through re-designing an interface of your choice.  Workload is manageable, allow a couple of hours for the readings, 1-2 more for the lectures, anywhere from 2-6 for the assignment/projects.  You do have to allot 4-6 more hours early in the semester to take mandatory Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training.\n\nThe grading system is a work in progress; this semester, assignments and projects were graded on hard A-B-C-D-F basis with an equal number of points for each grade (e.g. for a project worth 150 points, each grade gets you 37.5 points).   Tests were multiple choice with you receiving 1 point for each answer you correctly selected or did not select.  For some reason the grade scheme allowed basically anyone to get a B because the total number of points to get a B was 626 of the available 1000 points (63%).  An 88% overall grade gets you an A.  There was a TA shortage as the semester progressed (several had to drop for one reason or another), so grading slowed substantially the second half of the semester.  The TAs were basically invisible other than grading and the very occasional answer on Piazza, but their absence was not felt because Dr. Joyner was so engaged.   NOTE:  Dr Joyner today (6May18) said that this will be the last semester of the letter grade experiment, so expect a return to traditional point-based grading.   \n\nThis was a very enjoyable course thanks to the energy and enthusiasm Dr. Joyner displays for the material *and* online learning. The material was interesting and the concepts are certainly something you can use in real life.  This course was just added as an II elective and I would recommended it for those seeking that specialization.",

I hadn't taken the old CS 6505, but from what I've heard it was crazy difficult with its proofs. In this class, there is little to no emphasis on formal proofs. There is a bit of proving NP-completeness at the end of the course, but it's not very rigorous I'd say. The key to the course: study, study, study.  If you study as much as you can for this course, you'll get a B or A. If you don't put in the hours, you will likely not do well.",

The whole class is structured around designing and building a database-backed application (like many websites you might have used).  It is a lot of fun to work on Phase 3, since it's all about implementing something using MySQL+PHP, Python, etc that you've been designing all semester.

            "text": "This was my first class in the program and I absolutely loved it. Coming into this I was hoping for a solid introduction to OMSCS, computer science, and C and I would say that it was very successful on all fronts. I’ve consolidated my thoughts / tips about the class below based on topic.\n\n#### Projects\n1. The project code always contains a base set of functionality which you enhance. PR1 for example gives you most of the code for a working C program, you just need to cover the business logic (creation/parsing of a GETFILE protocol message). \n2. TA’s always provided the CMakelists file if you prefer to use CLion and that also makes things easier. \n3. _PR1 – GETFILE PROTOCOL_\n  1. I had very little C experience before this and I was a bit scared coming into the first project. Consequently, I began PR1 as soon as I could and finished about two weeks early. I spent a lot of time in the beginning establishing best practices for how to do things. It forced me to work slowly and do a ton of research on various C aspects, but by PR3-4 I was very confident in my C ability.  \n4. _PR2 – Extra credit research project_\n  2. I went above and beyond and did the experiments, which was not required. It took me about 4 hours to complete. \n5. _PR3 – Shared memory-based IPC_\n  1. This one was pretty easy for me. I completed it in about 6 hours total, including both parts.\n6. _PR4 – RPC_\n  1. This program is basically PR1 and PR3 where RPC abstracts all of the communication. It’s pretty easy, but took me about 12 hours to complete because I stumbed on the MT section. \n\n#### Knowing C\n1. I was completely new to C coming into this and excited to get some exposure. The first project will force you to use strings. Working with strings in C can be challenging. If you're like me and eager to learn new lower level languages, this class is perfect for you. \n2. The other thing that was pretty complicated was the implementation of a thread pool. You don't have to do it like this, but in terms of performance its the best way. Once you get a working thread pool implementation, you can use it for subsequent projects in the class. \n\n####  Tests\n1. Test 1 – 25% of your grade. I found it harder than the second exam. Median was a 76%.\n2. Test 2 – 30% of your grade. IMO, it was easier than the first exam by a long shot. \n\n####\tTAs\n1. Overall, the TAs were highly responsive, but very shame based. I suppose it’s an industry problem. The expectation is that you know the readme very well. Questions about well defined things on the readme or C related questions you can google will get you ridicule. Always try to find the answer on your own before you ask. \n\n####\tTips\n1. Use the study guide to study for the test. It seems obvious but, I studied everything I could get my hands on for the first test and felt like I made it much harder on myself. I found that other students were doing similar things. Since this is an introductory class, there are certain topics in which the rabbit hole goes deep. Make sure that you’re studying the material as it relates to GIOS. \n2. I would strongly recommend using CLion. They make an IDE for every language used in the OMSCS program and its heavily used in the industry. I ended up installing this on my Ubuntu VM and using it from there.\n3. There is a slack for this class and I would recommend it. The TA’s are very responsive. \n4. I would recommend the environment setup they use. I tried doing PR1 on my mac and had all sorts of problems. \n5. For debugging, there are a few tools which will make your life easier. I found these to be most helpful:\n  1. Telnet – must have for the first part to test your server before you finish the client\n  2. Wireshark – to confirm whether client or server is breaking\n  3. CLion debugger – self explanatory\n6. There is always a performance metric component to the test. These are based on the readings assigned during the semester. Know those very well, it’s low hanging fruit on the exam. \n7. Execution flows are a big part of this class. If you don't understand the math, I strongly recommend that you draw out the flow. The questions on the test are usually small enough that you can draw them out to achieve the answer. This is what I did for test 1 and 2 and it worked out well. \n8. At the end of the class, they added a lot of material and I felt like the amount of time required increased per week. Take this into account after the midterm and stay on-top of your lectures. \n9. \tSome of the last readings are unnecessary and very long. The RPC reading, for example, is unnecessary, dense, and 40 pages long. Since it was not present on the study guide, I skipped reading it altogether and it paid off. ",

The best approach to get full credit was to find a research paper related to the assignment and implement.

If you're _still_ determined to take this course without knowing C first (hey I get it, I was stubborn too), then do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy of [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/) (I found one pretty cheap at a local used books store) right now, because it'll be your lifesaver for the first few projects.\n\nThat said, even though I really struggled with the programming assignments, I still really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot from it.

As a result, I found this course to be very difficult. Many people in the class had significant programming experience, so probably didn't have as much difficulty. But even for these, there were challenges.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, you have a weekly jupyter notebook with roughly ten exercises to complete. These aren't too bad and one can often google their way through them. In fact, for all of the homeworks, I only missed one exercise. In the end, my homework score was 99.5%+. Homework counts for 50% of the grade.\n\nThe workbooks are released two weeks before they are due. So get yourself a bit ahead in the beginning and make a habit of turning them in early. Much less stress that way, for me at least. It was common to see people on Slack, Sunday night before homework is due, asking questions about the first exercise. Not sure what they were thinking.\n\nThe exams, though, were a different animal. For those, you'd get about twice as many exercises (usually 20-25) and could be significantly harder than the homework. AND, you had 24 hours (for the midterms) and 36 hours for the final to complete them. This resulted in marathon work sessions for most of us. In fact, in a poll we created in Slack, the average time spent on midterm 2 was about 17 hours. In my case, I did absolutely terribly on them, but, with the homework counting for so much of the grade, I was able to at least pass the class with a mediocre grade. \n\nIf you have significant coding background (or a strong natural aptitude) you'll be fine. But if you're like me, get ready for a lot of work and stress. \n\nIndeed, my biggest criticism is that I've never been in a class where there was such a disconnect between homework and exams in terms of performance. Usually, if one is doing well with homework, one should likewise expect to succeed on the tests. That is definitely not the case here. \n\nGood luck",

(I am a new member of a data science team).  Dr. Sokol structures the lectures well to be informative and efficient.  Bonus: dad jokes.\n\nHomework:  Challenging at first without R experience, but you quickly learn how to handle the language and to debug problems that pop up - plus, the TA hours and ability to work with peers helps tremendously.  I am a strong believer in Dr. Sokol's statement that we will continually need to learn new programming languages and packages in our career, and so being thrown into things without being hand-held is vaulable and realistic.\n\nProject - Fairly simple, though peer grading makes it a bit scary!  NOT a group project, which I appreciated.\n\nExams - While I received decent grades, I will say the exams were tricky (mostly #2 and #3).  Dr. Sokol knows how to write an exam to make sure you REALLY know the information more than surface-level.  Some questions are easy to interpret incorrectly, and that is my only gripe with the class.\n\nPrereqs - While there are technically prereqs for probability, linear algebra, calculus, and programming experience, the primary one that you need is some programming experience.  Coming in completely blind to programming would have been a significant handicap. Probability, linear algebra, and calculus are fairly minor (though not COMPLETELY invisible - eigenvectors and the calculation of linear, convex quadratic, general convex, and non-convex equations all do come up).\n\nOverall - definitely recommend this class, even as a standalone for non-degree students.

The instructor (Prof Vuduc) was great, but only showed up for a couple of the office hour sessions.

For the projects/labs, many times implementing algorithms as presented in class would not get you 100% on the lab (but you could still get an A or B fairly easily).  You need to be creative or research some methods to speed up your code (grades are based on run times).  After the grades were returned, there wasn't really much discussion on ways that people were able to get full credit, so I felt there was an opportunity for more learning that was missed.\n\nSome of the later projects had a few issues with cluster being temperamental - no fault of the teaching staff, but definitely frustrating for the students.  Our grades were based solely on run times, but we couldn't actually get accurate timings on some of the labs.\n\nFinally, the exams are notoriously difficult.

I was very close to withdrawing from the class and if it weren’t for the group project and the fear of letting my teammates down, I probably would have dropped it.\n\nFor each homework set I spent at least the first week (40+ hours) just trying to get my computer set-up with the software/environments necessary to even start programming. In several instances this has required making changes to the firmware, multiple uninstalls and re-installs all of which are incredibly time-consuming and I think not the point of this course. My only computer is my work computer and I have felt quite nervous about how these changes I have made might impact my machine and my ability to do my job if it were to crash. \n\nTo complete a homework assignment students were required to join Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which required entering personal credit card information. For each of these services there was the potential of running up thousands of dollars in charges if a mistake was made. This is an entirely unacceptable risk to ask students to take. Often learning takes place when mistakes are made and to put a financial burden on students who are already paying to learn is wrong.\n\n\nAt several points throughout the semester direct messages to the instructors went unanswered for days. At one point a very urgent message (labeled as such in the subject line) was ignored for 84 hours. At the point it was answered it was too late.\n\nThe difficulty I have had this semester has caused me to question my future in this program. If the 40+ hours per week of work needed for this course is indicative of any future courses, continuing to pursue this degree will be incompatible with maintaining my full-time job and family responsibilities.  I understand that Tech’s rigor is a part of its great reputation, and fully expected my classes to be very challenging. However, I did not expect to be subjected to unreasonable expectations and poor communication by professors in a professional graduate curriculum like the “weed-out” courses I had during undergrad.\n",

I had no previous business coursework and learned a lot. I was affirmed in my decision to pursue the business analytics track and found most of the concepts intuitive.  I also appreciated how little time I had to spend on the material each week.\nHowever, I can definitely see why so many students ripped on it from last semester, and If you are not accostomed to the more route memorization style of class then your may be frustrated in this course.\n\nHomeworks were challenging, but fun and I liked getting to see and get familiar with real-world financial statements. It is very possible to get 100% on all of the homeworks. \n\nThe tests on the other hand are super tricky. I got all of the computational, high point value questions corrrect, but the low-value multiple choice questions are killer and landed me with a 75% on the Midterm (yet to take the final). However, 75% was the average score and if I retained/recalled 75% of the insane amount of material we covered then I am happy.\n\nDr. Flurry though short and salty at times, but overall nice. He is SUPER responsive and over communicates so that there is no confusion about expectations, deadlines, etc. This was refreshing as none of my other course professors have been this involved and accessible. \n\n",

As many mentioned, you can only make a 90% for most assignments without doing Above and Beyond work.  This work isn't impossible, but even then you most likely won't get higher than a 95.  \n\nIf you aren't an amazing programmer, I would highly suggest you start on the projects well before they are due.  Don't procrastinate.  The TA's will not help on the projects in any way.  You will run into issues.  Start early on everything.  Before the midterm project, there is only one assignment that requires any coding at all, so the difficulty jump here is terrible. You need to brush up on your python and numpy skills well before you get to this point.\n\nThe notebook quizzes are terrible.  There is no other way to describe them.  They are only worth a tiny portion of your grade, though, so not too big of a problem.  \n\nThe assignments are pretty fun, but you don't code until about 1/3 of the way in as I mentioned before.  \n\nThe final project is student choice.  I didn't find this project as hard, but I had also gotten used to Numpy by this time.\n\nThe final exam is hard, but you get two chances.  Study and you will get a good grade.\n\nThe slack channel is your friend.  Seriously.  Bookmark this channel.  It is incredibly active and is probably the easiest way to get your questions answered.  One of the TA's is involved there and he is incredibly helpful.  You can also get great ideas for Above and Beyond in this channel.\n\nOverall, I liked this course a lot. I definitely recommend it and can easily be paired with a second course if you have the time.  Just make sure to get ahead on that midterm.   ",

Dr. Joyner is very active, both on the slack channel and the Piazza forums.  He is very helpful and I will take other courses by him.  There is very little TA involvement though.  \n\nAbout the course:\nThere are 10 assignments that are basically reports.  They require around 1600 words per paper.  These are fine and will help you understand the material well.  They can get a bit boring after awhile though.\n\nThere are two projects.  The individual project isn't difficult at all and I felt it was just like another assignment.  The group project was a repeat of 5 of the assignments you had already done, but now in a group.  If you can choose your own group.  My group was fine, but didn't communicate well.  I felt that I did a majority of the work.  \n\nThere are too many readings.  They start off interesting and get worse as you go.  I quit reading them after the midterm because I needed to spend more time in another class.  By doing so, my midterm grade went down 10 points.  This implies to me that they aren't that important.\n\nThe tests are open book.  I found them to be rough.  We got two hours to take them, but I think in the future they will only be 90 minutes.  Anyways, I didn't do the readings for them and still got a good grade, but I used all two hours and they were open book.  If the tests are not two hours in the future, you may want to make sure you do the readings as I always ran out of time when I searched through the readings for the answers to test.\n\nOverall, great class.  Loved it and Dr. Joyner is fantastic.  I highly recommend this class.  It would make a good pairing with a second course.",

There are 8 assignments that u can even start working on from the first day (of course not recommended). The videos are excellent - short, to the point and very close to the subject matter and the assignment. \n\n#### Assignments\nAll the assignments are evenly spaced and equivalently weighted. I would recommend referring to all the information \n at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Main_Page to learn more about this course itself.\n\nFew over achievers might grumble :), but the first part of the course (mini course for pandas) was extremely important for the final part of the assignments\n\n#### Exams\nThe exams are intended to test if your understood the videos and the concepts and does not try to trick you out of your grades. For the midterm, there are crowd sourced question banks whose intentions are to make sure you actually understood the various parts of the course. If you have gone through them all and figured out the basics behind them, the midterm should be simple enough though it is closed book and proctored.\n\nThe final does not have a question bank, but the same methodology of going through your videos and material should make it simple enough.\n\n#### Parting words\nThe last three assignments as noted as indeed challenging and equivalently given two weeks to complete. You can even start them on the first day though there might be tiny edits to the grading script at a later point.\n\nBut this is one of the best constructed courses and if you have some background in python, should be simple to pick up and any insights in finance would be an added booster.\n\n_Note: Though the course is constructed exceptionally well, it is not an easy A and you would still need to put in the hours required. Especially the two assignments marked as \"Very challenging\" easily took 20-25 hours over two weeks. _",

Be brutally honest about your skillsets to be matched correctly. There were few teams who had lot of trouble leading to disparaging discussions in Piazza.\n\nIf you have Junits and/or Java development experience, the assignments itself should be a breeze. The only problem would be a black-box testing assignment with no clue about what bugs you are looking for. I would recommend living with whatever is possible as at the end of the day, it accounts only for a small part of your final grade.\n\nIn the group project, attempt to identify an integration lead, ideally with Android experience. It would make all team mates lives simpler with each building one or more components and the lead integrating them together.\n\nI was the lead and all my other team mates either had paired this with other courses or were either getting a baby or moving, so getting the right team and responsibilities is crucial. There are 3 deliverables as a group and getting the dynamics is important to get them delivered.\n\n### Exams/Tests\nThere are no exams and all grading is done via Assignments\n\n### Office hours\nThis is the only 1 course out of the 3 that i have taken where the professor actually does a live office hours.\n\n### Parting words\nIf you have Java experience, this is a simple no-brainer class which can be clubbed together with another course. If you have no Java experience or haven't worked in a group, i would tread a bit light and look for an alternative if possible. The learnings are not that really extraordinary nor the effort worth the merit.",

            "text": "If you are coming to this course with very little experience in databases, as I did, expect to learn a LOT but be prepared to put in the effort. Compared to my previous OMSCS course (6300), I would say I averaged twice as many hours reading through the (often dense) textbook and studying for exams. The real gem was the project, where we learned everything from designing databases with diagrams and understanding DB concepts (EER, IFD, relations), to implementing them using languages and tools I'd never programmed in before (MySQL, Php, HTML, MAMP). It provided me with not only a working prototype of a database in action, but also with a great experience working with teammates who I plan to keep in contact with. By comparison, the four exams only nominally helped to prepare us for each phase of the project, and seemed much more difficult than initial self-study and sample exams would indicate. I think that pacing in the course could be improved; the beginning felt very rushed to complete everything, whereas by the end it felt like there wasn't enough to keep us busy. It was up to us to plan our learning material consumption, but the deadlines with exams and project phases did not always give ideal time lengths to prepare. Professor Mark and the TAs are knowledgeable and approachable, though if you really want questions answered be prepared to ask during office hours. Overall, it was a challenging course and I liked certain parts more than others, but I definitely learned a lot.",

Even though some of them are shallow, you do get deeper knowledge on the topics used for assignments, e.g. shortest path, A* search, decision trees/random forests, unsupervised learning (clustering), hidden markov model, etc. Some of them are must-knows for tech interviews. Also some very interesting topics like constraint satisfaction and logic planning, which could help you solve a lot of brain teasers:)\n\nI would say AI is about 2-3 times harder than DVA in terms of time spent, depending on your background. If you were like me, a professional developer in the industry for years, you will find it's easy to pick up python/numpy as part of your 1st assignment. But bayes networks, linear algebra and some other math really gave me hard time, so be prepared. \n\nThere're 6 programming assignments about each every 2 weeks, plus two exams each takes one week to finish. This made the schedule really tight and I didn't have too much down time during the semester even just taking this 1 course. So be prepared for a few busy weekends and stay-up-late nights if you work fulltime or/and have kids to take care of. \n\nOveral I loved this course and I think it was a great first course to AI before taking more ML related courses, as long as you're ready for the challenge.",

But overall, the lectures combined with supplementary googling usually had me in a comfortable place with the material. \n\nBad: \n- Midterm 2: The drama surrounding this is well known. We had a 24-hour time limit, and many (if not most) required the enitrety of that time. I took 18 hours straight including coding from sunset to sun up to finish with an 84%.

It was a useful course to me because I got to learn big data technologies like spark, hadoop, scala etc., - but you could have learned more if you just read a book on each of those subjects as this course does not go deep into each technology.\n\nThere were a lot of difficulties setting up env in the beginning. TAs were kinda responsive, but not very helpful. The homeworks were not structured well at all! I did have plenty of time to complete each homework, but I had no idea whether my code was right or wrong! There was no feedback or guidance on this part. So, for many assignments - students who check their code on few test cases after submission learned that they had missed a minor edge case which was only in the TA's test set and lost marks due to that. IMHO, if you actually want to learn big data technologies, grab a few books with big data tech. names on them and just do the programs in the book. You'll learn a lot more that way.\n\nThe only interesting part of the course was the project (which fortunately was a huge chunk of your final grade). You are allowed to choose from a wide range of pre-selected topics. The project can be done in a group of 3 or solo. You can also get access to datasets which are normally not available for free access online. I would say this was the only useful thing I got out of this course.\n\nI would assume this course is going to be restructured or rebuilt soon because of the complaints that were made during my semester. Overall, if you are not comfortable learning and implementing with 3-4 technologies in a short period of time, you are going to have a hard time. If you want to take this course, pair it with some lighter course and read additional big data material on your own to get the most out of this course.",

The assignments do a good job of covering all the important and interesting concepts of the course. Some assignments are difficult in the sense that - you can get it \"working\" relatively well, but to get the output they expect you'd have spend A LOT (extra emphasis on lot) of time parameter tuning.

Discussions on slack with other students was what helped me through the assignments.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting course.

            "text": "Background:\nThis is my first course in the OMSCS program and I intentionally took this course for two reasons.  First, I was interested in learning more about computer networks.  Next, from reviews on OMSCentral, this seemed to be on average one of the easier courses, so it provided a good stepping stone into the program.  I have an aerospace degree and have worked in the world of defense software for about 4 years now.\n\nPros:\n- The head TA (Stacia Stokes) is very attentive and present on Piazza.  Two thumbs up here.\n- Each project has enough time to complete.\n- The lectures, articles/readings, and projects do tie together for the most part.\n- You do learn a lot about both the historical and modern concepts of network programming.  They don't go too deep, but that's mainly because there is a lot of ground to cover.\n- Two instances of extra credit were offered (one for weekly discussions, another for an extra portion of the last project)\n\nCons:\n- The articles were difficult to read through.  Interesting topics, but the important points were buried in the article (typical techincal paper...).\n- The lecture videos can be a bit jumpy in its explanations, though it still holds to the overall lecture topic.\n- I had hoped to do a little more with software-defined networks (SDN's)\n- Projects 2 and 3 were intense (but if you get past those, you'll be fine.)\n- Test questions could sometimes be vague, and thus difficult to answer.\n- ProctorTrack may be more of a pain than it's worth.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this course.  I recommend it as a first course for anyone starting the program without a network background.  This course uses Python, so you'd benefit from already knowing it, but that's not a necessity.  Time spent each week really varied and depended on the project.  I probably spent time more than I needed to, so take that into account for the \"weekly workload\" stat.",

The material wasn't particularly difficult, but there is room to go as deep as you like with the above and beyond portion of the assignments.  I would recommend getting practice with Numpy if you are not familiar with it.  A cheap tripod was very useful for some of the assignments and I borrowed a DSLR for the camera obscura, which would have been much more difficult with a smartphone camera.  It was well organized and the assignments were fun.  I would recommend taking this course if you have any interest in photography or working with images.",

The projects also aren't finalized until pretty late, but the changes were almost always nothing. But the class is interesting enough. Its a light introduction to machine learning, and a medium introduction to finance. You aren't going to leave this class and be Warren Buffet, or know everything you need to know to make a high frequency trader, but you'll have a decent grasp, and give you enough of a teaser to let you know if you want explore ML or finance further.\n\nClass itself was pretty easy. Projects could be easy, or hard depending on you. I spent a lot of time messing around, but if I had focused I probably could have finished things a lot faster and easier. \n\nId recommend it to someone who wants a light introduction to machine learning.\n\n",

I took so much time to understand the lectures and readings. I look forward to seeing how much I know by taking exams in classes, but the exams made me feel like I was wasting my time. Almost every question requires the instructor to post a clarification on Piazza. Some of them even required a Wikipedia link in order to solve since it wasn't in the lectures or textbook. There is so much material to cover in this class, there should be no reason for adding material never taught.\n\nSecond: The assignments take a LONG time to complete. There are 6 of them every 2 weeks. You cannot catch your breath. As soon as you submit the previous assignment, the next one is released and back to work you go for hours upon hours. I do want to add that the assignments helped me learn the material the most.\n\nThird: The TAs take an extremely long time to respond to questions. This is horrible when you have less than two weeks to work on the assignments and you need a clarification.\n\nFourth: The lecture videos by professor Starner are awful and uninformative. The professor has two guest lecturers, Peter N and Sebastian T, and their lectures are way more informative and really good at explaining concepts. Professor Starner just reads from a script and is hard to listen to.\n\nI definitely would not take this class as my first AI class. I would take ML or other AI concepts first so that you know the material going in because when it comes to exams, you will not have been taught the material.",

It is easy to get an A in this class as long as you spend the time. Generally you will be able to keep working/debugging code until you are certain that it is 100% correct. You have 3 weeks per HW assignment, which is reasonable as long as you start working immediately and don't procrastinate on the group project.\n\nMy only gripe about this class is that it should be worth 6 credit hours instead of 3.

            "text": "Was already familiar with many of the algorithms that were covered in lecture. Later strategies were interesting. The projects are a whole other beast as they test much more than what is covered in lecture. Compared to other courses such as Computational Photography or Computer Vision I would say the projects are 'easier' conceptually but 'significantly less straightforward' to implement.\n\nEg a project which was basically 'implement particle filters' which I've implemented at least 3 times before took 10x as much time to finish as in other classes. This is due to a lack of scaffolding provided compared to other courses (you have to integrate your code and write almost everything that's not related to the core algorithm). I will say they did cover how to implement particle filters quite well. Just that the bulk of your time in the projects is not spent on the core algorithms the lectures cover.\n\nThe projects build on one another so if you didn't manage to get earlier projects be ready to devote significant time on later projects catching up. Lastly the grades are all or nothing (very much like real life) unlike other courses which test each part of the project separately.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the concepts taught in this class you will struggle with having enough time to implement them. That being said the lectures do cover the material quite well. It's just due to the all or nothing nature it'll be hard for you to know whether it is a bug with the algorithms or an integration bug somewhere else.\n\nSemi extra credit in terms of additional projects/challenges was offered, but I don't consider them realistic given the time devoted to core projects.\n\nI would NOT recommend this to new students to the program. For the final project around 1/3 of the students got 0% on the grade on a piazza poll and less than 1/2 got >50% due to the all or nothing nature.\n_____\nTip for project 3: Ignore almost everything that is suggested for this project by lecture. The biggest challenge is not related to what the project seems to want to test you on at all. If you waste your time on the algorithm covered in lecture. You won't have time to work on the actual time consuming part of the project. You won't even need anything you implemented in Project 2 or Project 1B. Just use the strategy from Project 1A to deal with inputs and focus on the real challenge. Learned this the hard way when I ran out of time and discovered my optimized implementation wasn't even needed or used in the final solution. Also for the mini project before hand, there's a significantly simpler alternative that's much easier than the suggested algorithm. Save your time for Project 2/3 instead of the miniproject.",

The assignments were released early enough that we generally had 2-3 weeks to work on them. Lectures were longer than other OMSA classes, but the assignments weren't extremely time intensive if you paid attention to the data examples in the lectures.\n\nBy far the biggest challenge in this course was miscommunication and a lack of clarity around terms. The course videos frequently had mistakes, and the course staff did a bad job of communicating (both notifying about and correcting the errors and also about other course logistics). The true/false questions on the assignments and midterms were extremely frustrating because the language often was not clear.\n\nAll that said, I really enjoyed the course material and felt the class was a very reasonable workload.

            "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and it really changed my perspective on how to design interfaces.  Dr. Joyner is a fantastic instructor, and this course was one of the best I've taken in the OMSCS program.  \n\nBefore I took this course, I had a vague sense of what made a poor user interface, and this course teaches you the underlying principles of usability and user-centered design.  After the course, I can now analyze and articulate how an interface could be improved based on user-centered design principles.\n\nThe course has two main lesson tracks that were taught in parallel: **Methods** and **Principles**. \n\n **Methods** focuses on the process of conducting HCI research such as understanding regulations about testing with human subjects, performing needfinding (understanding needs of the user), brainstorming approaches, prototyping, and evaluating designs.  All of this is comprises the design lifecycle.  \n\n**Principles** focuses on the design principles in HCI, such as the *Gulf of Execution* (how the user figures out what they want to do and how to do it) and the *Gulf of Evaluation* (did the interface respond how the user expected?).  You also will learn about concepts that improve usability and the limitations of users (human abilities).  This was my favorite portion of the course.\n\n**Assignments:** Weekly assignments were due that usually required 1200-1500 words of writing based on that week's lecture content.  I found these assignments to be easy but useful.  I usually spent 3-4 hours writing each assignment, but the **Methods** assignments required outside work that took a few hours to perform (conducting needfinding with others, developing prototypes, etc). \n\n**Tests:** There are two tests that cover the first half of the course and the second half of the course.  The two tests are open-book and open-note (including Udacity and papers) extremely straightforward (not necessarily easy), but there's no trickery involved or gotcha questions.  Dr. Joyner provided a terrific analysis after the exams to identify problematic questions and other potential test issues.  \n\n**Projects:**\nThere is an individual project and a group project where you go through a round of the design lifecycle by yourself (individual project) and then as a group (group project).  These projects primarily reinforce the material in the **Methods** lectures as you practice what you've learned in them.\n\n**tl;dr:** Excellent course.  Not super difficult.  Very enjoyable.  Great if you want to learn more about designing good UI/UX.",

            "text": "**Overall: **  It's a hard course even with a strong math background.  I did not find the assignments to be very helpful (they sapped my enthusiasm), and the tests are hard.  TAs were not very responsive in Piazza this semester (Spring 2018).  This class is too laissez-faire (in my opinion) and fails to provide effective feedback on assignments.\n\nI had a fair amount of ML experience from previous learning (I had watched the Supervised Learning lectures a year earlier, and taken other AI classes in the past) coming into this course, but this course was still challenging.  \n\nThe lecture quality is pretty good; the professors Isbell and Littman are very knowledgable and their humorous banter in the videos is funny.  I liked the conversational style they used in the videos - it's a dialogue between the teacher (alternates between Charles and Michael) and the other plays an inquisitive student who asks questions.\n\nThe assignments were super open-ended and I felt graded quite harshly given the lack of concrete direction.  There seemed to be a hidden rubric used to grade submissions that was not shared with students in the assignment descriptions.  I felt frustrated with the assignments because I felt like I wasn't really learning much but simply twiddling hyperparameter knobs in order to generate plots for the report.  Further, the feedback that I received from the TAs was usually  weak and non-specific after they'd take off 30 points.  I spent probably 30ish hours on average for the problem sets.\n\nI wish the course offered more structure (\"Students have successfully used this GitHub repo <some_url> for Assignment #1.  Train the model, plot learning curves (accuracy vs. time and accuracy vs. iterations), do tasks X, Y, Z\") rather than giving vague instructions (\"pick some interesting problems and fiddle with the hyperparameters for algorithms A, B, and C.  Plot some stuff and tell us your observations\").  I'd also have appreciated a more specific rubric for what's expected on the assignments - I'd love to go on the intellectual journey, but please tell me the waypoints!\n\nThe exams were hard but fair.\n\nI'm happy to have this course behind me.  There were high points (lecture content is good), but the assignments were simply not helpful for my learning.",

            "text": "For context, this was my second class after ML4T, so I had not taken ML.\n\nThe instruction format is Udacity lectures plus many many research papers to read. The lecturers (Isbell and Littman) are very engaging but the material itself can be quite dense. And the research papers are tough to get through if you are not used to reading academic CS papers. There are also weekly office hours with the TAs which were very helpful. The TAs were very accessible, hosting office hours and appearing in the Slack group.\n\nThe structure of the class is 2 homework assignments with a week to complete, then a project with 2 weeks to complete, for a total of 6 HW and 3 projects. There was an opportunity for an extra 10 points on one HW assignment. The assignments are released in 3 batches, so you can work ahead to some degree but couldn't finish the semester all at once.\n\nThe homework was challenging conceptually at times but usually did not require much code. I thought all of the homeworks did a good job of reinforcing concepts from the lectures. All 6 assignments were submitted through a web app that gave immediate feedback on your results. Each question on the assignments had a 10 submission limit to prevent brute-forcing solutions.\n\nTwo projects involved reproducing results from research papers, and one involved training an agent for an OpenAI Gym environment, using an algorithm from a research paper(s) of your choice. The deliverable was the code on Github and a 5-page report on your results. \n\nI did not enjoy the projects based on reproducing papers and didn't find the topics very interesting. The OpenAI project was quite interesting but very time-consuming. Training time for the agent could take many hours so iterating on a concept was difficult.\n\nOverall I thought the course was very well done even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was more theory and less practice than I would have liked, but that's a matter of personal preference.",

            "text": "I took this course with Dr. Chau (OMSA). The OMSA course consists of 4 very large assignments and a semester-long group project. I believe this may be the most time-intensive course in the OMSA program, and I recommend either taking it early or as a \"capstone\" class to finish up the program.\n\nThe most challenging part of this course was the amount of time that needed to be put into the assignments and projects. The concepts were arguably quite simple, each assignment required learning one or more new programming languages and/or technologies. Setup of the environments required often took a lot of time too. Dr. Chau was receptive to feedback, and modified the last assignment to have one of the questions be for bonus credit, which helped it be more manageable. It's possible the online course will change dramatically based on the course feedback. That said, it is an incredibly time intensive course and you should plan accordingly.\n\nThe project was... frustrating (to me). The assignments were so time intensive that our team struggled to work on the project early on and ended up pulling things together at the last minute. Another challenge was the difficulty in making group decisions when a group leader wasn't established and the whole team couldn't find time to meet virtually.\n\nI will address the concern about using Azure and AWS with a personal credit card as stated in another review. While, yes, it was annoying and uncomfortable to provide that information, for both services we got much, much more free credit than was needed to complete the assignment, and students who did go over the free limit were able to get the charges waived by calling customer support and explaining the situation. The Azure part of the assignment could be completed on a personal computer and then uploaded to the server, eliminating any chance of error/using up the credit.\n\nI learned so much in this class and was exposed to a large number of data technologies. I know there are some people who struggled greatly with this class, but I found it comparable to (if not easier than) my undergrad engineering courses at a top-ranked engineering school, so the quality was what I expected. I think the class does have room for improvement, and could use more TA support to improve communication and responses to Piazza. All said, I wish I had used this as a capstone class toward the end of my degree and had taken it on its own, so I could have gotten more out of the project.",

I completed a computer engineering degree in 2014 as my only previous computer science exposure before this program for comparison to your circumstances.\n\nThis course is lighter compared to the harder courses in terms of pace and difficulty. The projects are less frequent at about one a month and are easier to figure out, especially when you have no background in the topic. I fell in this category for all of the projects so I averaged about 20 hours total a project between coding and writing the report. If you have significant experience in C with buffer overflows, or HTML/Javascript, then all of these projects can be completed in one night for you. The quizzes are straight from the lectures and book, so the book has great value for these. The tests focus on details and terminology from large amounts of chapters and lectures so memorizing that much information is the hardest part. The TAs and professor run the course very well and all our issues with Canvas will be figured out by the time later students take this course.\n\nI recommend this course as a great first course if you are coming from a technical background that is not computer science or engineering. This can also be paired with the harder courses like AI, ML, and GA. ",

The projects could be a breeze if your mental model matched that of the TA that wrote the grader.  But if your implementation runs afoul of the grader (even if it works locally and passes tests), get ready for many hours of hair-pulling trying to figure-out the inner workings of the black box that is the grader.  The tests also bugged me.  They were \"fun\" in the sense that there was some humor to them, but they're basically word problems that include a small amount of AI concepts and a lot of high-stakes arithmetic.  You're literally building spreadsheets and/or writing code to solve problems and if your answer isn't accurate to within the sixth decimal, you get zero points.  Quite tedious if you ask me.",

I had learned the basics of Python in CN but I had not used numpy at all before this course. Additionally, I completed a computer engineering undergraduate degree in 2014 as my only other exposure to computer science before this program. This information is all to compare to your own circumstances.\n\nOverall, this course was by far my favorite while also being the most difficult and most work thus far. Some projects took 10 hours while others took up to 50 hours due to my background. The projects are very diverse so if you've never seen some of these topics until this course, then your learning curve will be longer for each project like mine. The majority of the projects had extra credit that rewards those who know their coding and material. I highly recommend scoring as many points as possible on the projects as the midterm and finals are intense.\n\nBoth exams are take-home exams that are 35-45 pages each with a full week to complete. I spent 40-50 hours on them to achieve a level above the median to make up for my lackluster performance on a project. These exams will thoroughly test your knowledge of each part of the course, which I prefer as you can't fake your knowledge. You are only allowed the class resources and book for these exams. No INTERNET, collaboration and so forth is allowed. The book is a must due to the complexity of the concepts and use for projects and exams.\n\nI highly recommend this course if you have never taken an AI course before as you will learn a ton. However, honestly gauge your knowledge and skills beforehand to see how much of your life you will have to give to be able to succeed. After taking two courses as a full-time student, I do not recommend another course at the same time if you work full-time unless you have expertise in python, numpy, and AI concepts.",

All data scientist should learn a bit R)\n\n2- Data Visualization (This is part I love for this course, you will learn a lot of different visualization of data)\n\n3- Preprocessing Data (Also very good, it is very important to learn how to clean dirty data)\n\n4- Logistic Regression (Not good, they use too complicated terms to describe, even I have previous ML experience, I still couldn't understand these lectures)\n\n5- Linear Regression (Same as logistic regression)\n\n6- Regularization (Not bad, but it can be better) \n\nAgain, this course did excellent job in R and data visualization/preprocess, but I completely dislike the second half of this course. If you are going to be in ML specialization, take CV instead. ",

Even on Sundays sometimes!\n\nI did not like how heavy the grading favors the tests - I spent 100+ hours on the projects and probably less than 10 studying for the exams, but the exams are weighted as 60% of grade.

Thumb up to Head of TA and Erin, who are most responsible TAs I've encountered so far in my education.\n\nAssignment &  Project:\n7 Assignment\n1 Group Project and 1 Individual Project\nFirst 3 Assignments teach you to write simple Java program in IDE.\nGroup Project is to step-by-step design and to build an Android App. I think it is a good intro for software development process, including documentation, UML, test plan and even some database skill to prepare the overall structure of the app. But don't worry about you have to do it all by yourself. Highly suggest you get a better computer in order to run the android studio smoothly. It saves your testing time for quite a bit.\nI think the Individual project is a little bit easy and less practical in term software design. Though it covered the course content of black-box testing and refactoring, we didn't get to practice that on a complete software program.(It is a small command line utility)\n\nIf you think you don't have any CS background, you could take this course as the only one and first course. If you have any background in Java or familiar with another programming language, I would suggest you to take this class with another medium or easy class in your first semester or take it in the summer.\n\nEnjoy this class with good discussion and helps from classmates!\n\n\n",

For the second half of the assignment, it can be done more easily by working 2 weeks straight without the smart part.\n\nYour fellow classmates will reach a 100 in the assignments and drive the median up, so that means you have to as well.

            "text": "I am struggling to write this review. I was genuinely excited to take this class, having heard that a lot of people loved it. Now that it is over I have mixed feelings. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1) This course really should be split into 2 courses. There is just so much material that the semester feels way too rushed. I didn't get to fully process each assignment because it was due within two weeks, and then another (really big) assignment was assigned right away. The midterm and final were used to 'teach' us concepts that the assignments and lectures didn't go into any depth on. Having more time would allow for interesting programming assignments on topics such as neural nets, constraint satisfaction problems, etc. It would also allow for the midterm and final to focus on topics that have been fully taught. I have no idea the mechanics of splitting a course up, but I hope the idea is considered for the sake of future students. \n\n2) The midterm and final were rough. They were long (each took me 15-20 hours and I could have spent longer) and each one had some topics that were literally just a mention in the lectures. The student had to research and learn on their own how to solve problems and use certain equations. In addition, the questions themselves were not well vetted. Most questions required multiple clarifications during exam week, which required that you go back and redo questions you thought were done (to make sure your interpretation matched the clarification). The exam questions were excellent for homework problems, but on a high-stakes exam it was not a good experience. \n\n3) The curve is generous, so if your grade is low you still have hope of at least a B. Don't be intimidated by the 100% median on assignments.\n\n4) You get to drop one of the six assignments. This is critical considering how fast the class moves.\n\n5) Do NOT take as a first course. I recommend it be the middle or end of your course progression. I took it halfway through after ML4T, which was great because the Python/numpy came in very handy.\n\n6) Carve out time for this class. I do not recommend pairing it with another course, and find ways to set aside at least 20 hours a week. \n\n7) As far as prep, reviewing Bayes/basic probability and having solid Python skills will help.\n\nOverall I learned SO much from this class. The material was super interesting. I just wish the exams were done differently and the material could be more spread out. ",

            "text": "##### Overview\n\nLet me preface my review by saying that I went into this course really excited to learn about Machine Learning (with a mild interest in trading), having chosen to specialize in it through OMS CS. Unfortunately, this is a Finance class under the guise of a \"Machine Learning\" class. I put Machine Learning in quotes, because even Andrew Ng's outdated, free Coursera class provides a better introduction to ML compared to this one. By the way, there is zero mathematical background required for what is taught in this course, which is disappointing. If you compare the curriculum to Stanford/UC Berkeley/MIT, you will see that they are miles apart.\n\n##### What You'll Learn\nYou will implement: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Bagging/Boosting, and Q-learning. The rest of the course is about finance, with some Python syntax thrown into the mix. In addition, this course doesn't feel like a master's level class due to the amount of hand-holding it does (step by step instructions on what to do, you just need to convert it into Python syntax).\n\n##### Positives\nThe videos for this course are well-done, are interesting and are directly tied to the projects, unlike other classes. Also, because there's no curve, the classroom environment becomes very positive (not competitive) and people genuinely try to help everyone else.",

I've never worked with R but by the end of the class, I felt pretty confident using that language to analyze and visualize data. This class has an excellent ratio of Theory and Practice.\n\nAlso, because of the practical side of this class, I was able to get a job as a Junior Data Scientist!! \nSo, in short, you'll learn R, Data Analysis and Visualization, Intro to ML (Logistic and Linear Regression) and hands-on experience in case you want to look for jobs in Data Science. \n\n That's a 10 in my book, hehe.",

            "text": "I found this course to be very enjoyable in general. The lectures were a bit hit or miss, but the assignments were usually good about guiding you through the problems. I came into the course with some programming experience but only very little exposure to Python, and I thought it was a great introduction to Python including Pandas, NumPy and SciPy. The later assignments focused more on mathematical theory and concepts useful to data analytics such as optimization problems and algorithms, which were very math-y but also very helpful to reinforce my understanding of the workings behind these methods. It helped that there was a refresher on the linear algebra and calculus included as part of the instructional materials.\n\nThe fact that the assignments are autograded with unlimited submissions means you have as much time as you need to test your solutions and get as much credit as you can. The assignments are released well ahead of time so if you need to get a head start and give yourself some time off between assignments that's totally feasible. Some assignments were much easier than others, so I'd say the avg workload was about 4-8 hours per week.\n\nThe exams worked much the same way homework did, open note/internet with no proctoring, but were much longer than the typical homework assignment and with a time limit (both midterms were 24 hrs, the final was 36 hrs). I spent about 5-8 hours with each of the three exams, but I know other students struggled with the amount of time they needed to complete the tests. The professor and TAs were responsive and made some changes to the exam format to help accommodate the students who had issues though, which I appreciated even though it didn't impact me much.\n\nOverall, highly recommended course. As someone who had a programming background, I think it's still worthwhile to take unless you're already very comfortable using Python, Pandas, NumPy and SciPy.",

If you don't understand regression and don't know R, I would actually suggest this course as your first course in the program instead of ISYE 6501.  Prof Serban does a nice job taking you through examples in R line by line to help you understand what you are doing.  The biggest weakness of this course is the general organizational stuff.  There were tons of typos in the homeworks and due dates seemed to shift.  The course could also do with a pass through the video transcription to better match the video.  Prof Serban, in the couple of instances I interacted with her, was generally flexible and accommodating of issues and feedback from students.  My only other complaint is that I would have liked to spend more time working with the models talked about in unit six (non linear regression, non parametric regression, etc)  The class focuses on Linear Regresssion, ANOVA, Logistic Regression, Poisson Regression and Variable Selection.

            "text": "I absolutely loved this course, and I'm very glad I chose it for my first semester. Dr. Sokol's lectures were engaging, informative, and clearly understandable. I don't know if there's much he could have done better with the lectures, they were that good. Even when he was working through formulae and variables, I was still able to follow along most of the time, and if I wasn't, just a couple repeat viewings and I was on the same page. The course surveys countless topics at a rapid speed, but I never felt like it was moving too fast. I'm amazed at how much I know now compared to the start of the semester.\n\nHomeworks mostly use R for building and evaluating models. I'd had no experience with R before starting the course, so the early going was a bit rough, but once I got up to speed I was much more comfortable. The assignments are designed to set you on your own path of discovery and learning, and I found that I benefited the most from them when I approached them that way. On the weeks where I was more time-constrained or felt a bit lost in R, I found the TA office hours sessions to be very helpful. I never attended one live, I only ever watched video recordings. I did my best not to carbon copy everything the TAs had done, because they basically provided you with the answers most of the time - even something as simple as changing the names of variables helped me internalize the solution better than copying everything to the letter. \n\nPeer reviewing has pros and cons, the biggest pro is that I saw a few really impressive submissions that actually taught me a thing or two (especially when people took the time to create Jupyter notebooks out of their submissions) but the worst con was reviewing some of the poorer submissions or the ones that just lifted the answers from the TA office hours with no elaboration. So depending on the luck of the draw you could find the peer review process to be educational or not. Also, feedback from other students was very inconsistent, sometimes you'd get great suggestions about how you could have done things differently, but most of the time it seems I got no feedback at all or something brief like \"good job\" with no detail. \n\nExams were very fair, and I didn't mind the proctoring as much as I thought I would (but I'm also not a parent so a quiet, private session was easy for me to manage). Exam questions usually required you to think through every answer and choose carefully, and I thought they did a good job testing my understanding of the material.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this course highly enough, and I strongly suggest taking it in your first semester as an OMSA student if you can.

The video are well done but many of them are just walkthroughs of your homework assignment that week.  The exams are insane.  For the two mid terms you are given 24 hours to complete the exam.  However, unless you are a very experienced programmer, you can expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours of work to complete each mid term (based on the results of slack polls).    Again, if you are python pro, you'll finish the exams in like 6 hours, but if you're not, plan on clearing your schedule for 24 hours because you will most likely need the time.  The mid term was also like this although we were given 36 hours to complete the exam instead of 24.  An improvement to be sure but still a very stressful and intense 36 hours.  To give some perspective, someone pointed out in Slack, 18 hours is the length of the California Bar Exam administered over 3 days.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that you'll spend that much time on each exams over one 24 hours period.     ",

            "text": "My background: Mechanical engineer with minimal programming experience. I did take GTs introduction to Computing which utilizes Python. However, this class uses R so take that for what it's worth.\n\nLectures: Lectures are well organized, sufficient material to have a clear understanding of the topic but not so much that you begin to zone out and lose interest. When studying for the final, I was able to review and watch all lectures within a few hours (2x speed).\n\nHomework: Like many reviews, I will agree that the homework assignments can be disproportionate in terms of overall grade weight and time input, especially if you're like me with very little R programming experience coming into the class. Still, good practice utilizing the concepts learned in lectures. Peer grading can be very inconsistent, but generally forgiving overall.\n\nProject: No coding, open ended. The opposite of HW. Equal to over half of HW grade weight but equal to the amount of work for a single HW. Some adjustments could be made between the two.\n\nQuizzes (midterms): These can be pretty tricky so you really have to have a solid understanding of the material. An item that was only mentioned for a few seconds on a single slide could be a question on any quiz. A \"cheat sheet\" is allowed for all quizzes but I rarely used them. I believe they were a teaching mechanism to re-enforce learning more than they were as a reference on a quiz.\n\nProfessor/TAs: Solid. Dr. Sokol's personality really shows in the lectures and he clearly enjoys the material which also gets the student naturally engaged in learning. The TAs were very responsive in Piazza/office hours and also the slack group for the class so you never felt like you were on an island.\n\nTip: Join the slack group\n\nOverall, excellent course.",

TA's weekly office hour was very very helpful to clarify confusions in a homework. Few troll in peers can give you a low grade without any comment, which is frustrating. But, most of reviews I got was reasonable and helped me to improve. If they don't change the system in the next semester, your assignments will be reviewed by three different randomly chosen peers and assigned grade will be a median of the three grades.\n\nExams were fair. There were few tricky questions that require some thinking. What I liked the most for the exams was that it was designed to test your understanding on the models, not memorization. \n\nOverall it is very good class and I've learned a lot through this class.

            "text": "While there is room for improvement, this class definitely isn't quite the hot mess that it was in some previous semesters. Like the Fall 2017 semester, Professor Joyner once again joined the instructor team to help ensure things ran more or less smoothly. And by \"help\", I mean he appeared to be \"the\" instructor for the course (despite what the course sign-up states, Professor Chakraborty was not involved in anything student-facing). Dr. Joyner and the TAs did a nice job keeping us up-to-date and on-track, though it's a continued pet peeve of mine when an instructor literally ignores their students for the entire semester.\n\nContent-wise, the first half of the course's lectures were pretty good. Dr Lebanon's explanations and manner-of-speaking tend to make things needlessly complicated, especially when getting into the more math-heavy topics, but nothing was too overwhelming. The second half of the course was a lot harder to follow, again mainly due to the way the content was presented. Several students posted alternate sources of information on Piazza that made the concepts much easier to understand. It's like too much focus was placed on the theory and exact formulas rather than what it actually means in practice.\n\nThe projects and homeworks were all pretty fair, in my opinion, even though I came in with no R experience whatsoever. Some assignments were intimidating to start, but became more manageable after spending some time playing with them. The TAs also posted helpful hints for some assignments. The exams were both a bit crude, handled via ProctorTrack. The midterm had a lot of disagreement with wording and ambiguity. The instructor team did eventually address a few of the questions about a month later and gave some points back, but other questions were never clarified.\n\nGrade-wise, it still seems fairly easy to get an A as long as you're not waiting until the last minute to do an assignment (and almost everything is available from the first week of class, so there's no need to wait). Four homeworks worth 10% each, two projects worth 20% each, two exams worth 10% each, and 5 activities worth 1% each. Since that's 105%, you've got 15% of leeway to stay in \"A\" range. There didn't seem to be many issues with grading as long as you followed the requirements.\n\nCommunication-wise is where things could have been better. The TAs were great for office hours on Slack and generally responsive on Piazza, but private posts would get ignored and it seemed like there were some topics the TAs didn't want to get involved with.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good class if you're interested in R, but the lectures were often awkward to watch and the algebra portions didn't really add much to the course in any meaningful way.",

The first 2-3 projects being the hardest of the bunch.\n\nEvery week you are expected to read chapters out of the book. If you don't, boy are you in for a fun time with the midterm and final.\n\nMidterm and Final are take home exams and are given a week to complete them. I spent at least 20 hours on each one. If you work full time, expect your entire night and most of the weekend that week to be spent working on the exam.\nWhile I loathed the exams, I learned a lot from them. They cover all of the topics you read through, unfortunately you have to learn as you go. They release challenge questions throughout the semester that were previous exam questions. These _somewhat_ help, but are not really the full cigar in terms of adequately preparing you for the exam. If you kept up on the readings, you'll at least know where to look to find the relevant topic.\n\nDr. Starner is not very present in this class outside of the lectures. He hosted office hours before each exam and that was it. He rarely posted on Piazza. Some TAs were better than others, but they were overall okay.\n\nI don't recommend taking this class as your first course. Come in understanding python and numpy. A good understanding of probability will also help and will make Bayes Nets much easier. I spent a long time figuring it out but am still weak on Probability Theory. \n\nI also recommend _not_ pairing this course with any others. Each week is pretty demanding and you'll really want to spend time understanding the topics and not feeling rushed with the projects.\n\n\nAll in all I am walking away from this class with a much better, and deeper understanding of AI topics.

            "text": "This was my first class in the program, and I really enjoyed it. I came into this course with plenty of C knowledge, and I thought I understood Operating Systems concepts well (turns out I did not). I would say with my background, this course is more like a medium difficulty because of the amount of content, but for those new to C or OS concepts, I suspect it would be quite hard. That said, it is an achievable course, and with the generous curving policy it does not aim to make your life difficult. If you complete the work and give the class a fair shot, you will probably earn a B. Earning an A takes a bit more work.\n\nProjects are described in better detail on other reviews. With my C background, Pr1 took about 10-12 hours, Pr2 took about 4-6, Pr3 took about 8, and Pr4 took about 5. I would say they are difficult, but at no point did I feel like I was lost without any clue what to do next. If you reference the readme, make use of search functionality in Google, Piazza, and Slack, and when that fails, ask relevant questions, the projects are quite achievable without any existing C knowledge. But I will admit they would be quite difficult if you haven't been exposed to much C. I would say you could double or triple my times if you're trying to learn C along the way. It would be a good way to learn C, for what it's worth.\n\nExams are difficult. I thought I understood OS material already, but the course went much deeper into how things work under the hood. It does a good job of exposing you to important academic research in the field, and gives you some of the early building blocks of how things came to be. The exams are multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank for calculations, but they are far from easy. You will not do well if you haven't absorbed the lecture material and given the paper readings a fair shake. The exams are both quite fair, though. The practice questions provided give you a very good view of what will be on the test, but again, they are not easy.\n\nThe course makes it very easy to participate. A TA has opened up a private paid slack instance which to me was invaluable this semester. It allowed many people a place to get more instantaneous help with projects and material, as well as get to know each other and create decent relationships, for an online program. If Piazza isn't your thing, this is a great resource to have. Either Slack and Piazza participation counts for a small portion of the final grade, but there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.\n\nMy advice on this course would be to brush up on basic C concepts, and hit the ground running. Use the first week to get ahead on lectures and readings, so that when the first project comes out you can start work immediately. The only people I observed struggling with it to the point of not completing it were those who started it halfway through the deadline. There is generous time given to complete the projects, which makes it ripe for procrastination, but do not. I would also advise you to get ahead on the second half of the course - the material on the final is about 2 times the content of the material on the midterm, so work quickly through that material to allow plenty of time to review for the final.\n\nIf you come in with some interest in the subject, it is a very rewarding course. I like that it doesn't hold a grade over your head, which helps with enjoyability... but you do have to do the work to obtain it. In my opinion it makes an excellent first course, as it is well-run, the TAs are available and helpful, the professor actively participates despite the large class sizes, and the projects are well put together and help expand on the material you learn.",

This was the only course I took this semester and I struggled to keep up with the amount of practice and preparation that was required. \n\nIf you are reading this review and hoping to prepare for the class, study DP, NP Reductions and Max-Flow as well as Min-Cut. These are the main topics you will be tested on. There are graph algorithms as well, but you will never be asked to find a shortest path or anything like that, you will need to know how the algorithm works and based on the problem presented you will need to identify whether or not the algorithm can be used to solve the problem.\n\nThe lectures in my opinion are only good if you read the book first, then watch them once as you take notes and then watch them again just for content. So in other words they are not as good as other OMSCS courses. If you plan on grasping the material just by looking at the lectures, you probably won't because the lectures go quite fast and they only explain the basics of how to do the problems. A lot of times I also found myself going on YouTube to try to look at different explanations because I thought the explanations given were either not clear or just not good enough. \n\nI suggest taking this course on its own and if you have a few classes left, perhaps a semester before you graduate so you can re-take it if you do not get a B. \n\nI would also suggest to become a regular on Piazza and do all the homeworks even though they are not worth many points. Basically, if you know how to do the homework, you will have the needed knowledge to pass the test. ",

I liked DVA, but I thought this course was much better - I loved it. \n\n**Positives**:\n\nDr Thrun's lectures are fascinating, and he has boundless enthusiasm for the subject. That enthusiasm didn't just come through in the lectures, but in the three office hours he gave throughout the semester. These office hours were interesting too, and he took questions from students ranging from project implementation details to research and industry topics. Pretty cool.\n\nDr Summet's office hours were very useful, and he held them every week. He was also very involved on Piazza and personally answered many student questions. \n\nThe projects are fun. The course doesn't cover *that* many topics, but you will become an expert in A*/DP path planning, Kalman/Particle filters, and PID control. When/if you finish the projects, you'll feel proud. And if you're like me,  you'll replay the Python scripts over and over once you're done just to watch what you made.\n\nIn my semester, the students on Piazza were valuable and supportive. \n\nThere were no tests, and the homework answers were given for free (they still counted towards your grade). No group projects. You'll have many weeks to prepare for most of the projects.\n\n**Negatives**\n\nThe projects really seem all-or-nothing. They use an automated grader to score your projects, and you'll probably have to spend double digit hours just to maybe get a tiny amount of points from the sample grader. The real test cases they will grade with are not given in advance, but sample cases are provided that closely match. Don't underestimate the time commitment you'll need for those projects. We had a week extension on the last project, and still many people reported that they could not get *any* points on their test runs before having to turn it in. \n\n**Tips**\n\nPython is heavily used, and it will be valuable if you're already familiar with it. Start the projects right when they become available. Try to do the projects in stages, like making sure you have basic functionality before meeting the full requirements. \n\nI wouldn't go so far to say that the lectures didn't cover what you need for the projects (like others have stated). The core of my logic for every project was solely stuff we learned in class. That being said, there are implementation details that will take a while to work out, and parameters that will need to be heavily tuned. You'll have to get creative.",

If you're a perfectionist and like finding out the \"right\" approaches to problems (eg, using the R vectorization instead of a for-loop, or tweaking your regression parameters to minimize RMSE as much as possible), the assignments can take a while. \n\nEach assignment was written in R, and you'll get a pretty decent grasp of the language. I would feel comfortable using it in a professional environment now.\n\nThere are five activities you can perform that each add 1 point of extra credit to your grade.\n\nThe TA's and students are very helpful on Piazza and Slack. I can't even count how many times I got stuck on a problem, only to find a relevant post somewhere on the community boards.\n\nDr. Joyner seems a lot about making a somewhat infamous class better and fairer to students. I don't agree at all with the below reviewer from my same semester who questions his ethics. It's clear that Joyner listened to student concerns and made fair adjustments. \n\n**Negatives**\n\nTo be honest, a few of the lectures were flat out boring to me. On the other hand, others were hilarious and bordered on the surreal - almost like I was watching a Tim and Eric episode. For example, Dr Lebanon has a penchant for using a cutout of his own head to illustrate topics, like when he mashed together angel and devil clip-art over his shoulder to represent Frequentists and Bayesians arguing... all the while talking about the topic in his droning monotone. Hilarious. I don't want to overstate it though - some of the lectures were great, and I'll likely watch some of them again.\n\nLots of the assignment instructions were pretty unclear, although I'm thankful to the TA's and other students for clearing most of them up. The midterm had some ambiguity in it too (not great for a multiple selection/multiple choice test), but to the instructors credit, they rectified the obvious ones and gave students' credit.  ",

The first two projects were 60+ hr  of work each for me.  I did well on the third because it was easier and also am more comfortable C.  I'm guessing a student with a C programming background could complete the projects in a quarter the time I spent.  It did take significant effort up front to understand the requirements of the projects.  You can do this class without C in you skillset, but you will spend 10+ hours a week the first half of the course catching up on it because the projects require it.  Working full time, tackling this course material, teaching myself C, and another class on top of that was not the best idea.  \n\nThe professor, TAs, and Piazza/slack community were great in getting assistance with the projects and answering questions. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are well presented and organized.  Due to my efforts catching up on C and taking another class, I did not get to dive into the material as much as I would have liked.  One thing that I wish the class provided was more assignments related to the readings.  Whether essay or simple quizzes, I think it would help students take more from this material to have it tested in more than just the two exams.  Only half the readings relate at all to the projects.  No textbook required, but you should have some OS programming reference material handy.\n\nOverall very worthwhile course but A LOT of work if you don't know C!\n\nsemi-pro tip: Set up and get comfortable with an IDE ( I used VS code, many used CLion) the first week or prior to taking the class.  You will need it!",

I spent an average of 15 hours per week over the 15 week period on this course (including time spent on the exams, which is significant). Grading is very straightforward, with a graded homework assignment almost every week (13 in total); these count for 3-4% each, or 50% in total. The homeworks are beginner friendly, because you have an unlimited number of submissions. Midterm 1 counts 10%, Midterm 2 15%, and 25% for the Final. This term MT2 was the most challenging of all. They gave us a 24h window for MT1 and MT2, and even 36 hours for the Final; if you are a slow coder, you will use most of these time windows. After some negative feedback for MT2, my impression was that the Final was slightly easier. \n\nSo this course was hard, but I had a tremendous learning curve, I am amazed by all the stuff I know how to do with Python now, and I feel well prepared for the coming CS classes in this programme.

Midterms are not cumulative, so you can dive deep and practice specific topics as much as you want.\n- This class is a marathon run. There a re no dull moments. Every week you’ll either be busy working on a HW or prepping for an exam. That’s why try not to burn yourself by prepping too much before the semester starts.\n\nBottom line. This is the best run class in OMSCS. And one of the most important to take. Can’t believe there’s a specialization (Interactive Intelligence) that doesn’t mandate this course.",

Additionally there are weekly quizzes (10), and a final exam.\n\n**PROS**\n\n* Topics are interesting and relevant to today's \"cloud\" environments.\n* Projects are engaging and provide opportunities to practice hands-on learning.\n* Piazza was very active and students were very engaged in discussing the presented topics.\n* Helps you appreciate the importance of network security.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* Professor is completely absent from the class.\n* Video lectures were often too shallow to really describe the topics.\n* Project descriptions and write-ups are confusing and often contain grammatical and spelling mistakes.\n* Only one TA is very actively engaged in the discussions, while the rest are often MIA.\n* Grading mistakes were made that required regrade requests.\n\nThe saving grace for the class is that the majority of students are smart and experienced technology professionals who are able to provide thoughtful discussions throughout the course.

In my case, CV provided the background to make CP only medium difficulty.\n\nTips to get an A: \n1. Always try for A&B: The above and beyond grading scheme on the assignments is a strange beast. On one hand, you have absolutely no clue how to get that final 10% of your grade. On the other hand, it encourages you to just try something -  just use your wild imagination and creativity - and you are rewarded by the fair and generous grading.\n\n2. The assignments, projects and exams get progressively harder and trickier towards the end of the course, so work hard at the beginning and don't procrastinate.\n3. You're generally graded on the quality of the report and not the code, so have fun coding and all, but to get full marks, make sure you answer all the questions and follow all the guidelines in the report. In fact, if your code fails or you run out of time, you can still get a good grade by describing what you did and didn't do.",

Overall, the course was very descriptive when it came to forcing the understanding of the few types of regression models discussed in the class. After taking this class, the takeaways should be the model code and the interpretation of the models both in a statistical way and in layman's terms. The course material itself is quite straightforward, plug-and-play in just about every way and requires more regurgitation skill rather than critical thinking (making the exam open book made the course disgustingly easy).\n\nThere are no surprises in this class - everything on the exam will have been discussed in enough detail in either the lecture videos or homework. If the question was ambiguous or flat-out wrong, the professor would personally review and clarify, even refunding lost points. \n\n5 homework assignments, each having a multiple choice section for a small portion of the grade and then a couple of self/peer reviewed sections having to do with the data analysis. Each one had a few weeks' worth of time to complete, so the timing was quite reasonable unless you procrastinated. 3 exams with the same format as the homework, just spanning additional subjects and 2.5 hours to complete. All reasonable, unless you had a bug in your code.\n\nOnly two drawbacks in this class - the material is incredibly dry and repetitive. There are 15 minute lectures for what could be explained at a high level in 3, but get drawn out and watched regardless (easily half of the week's workload would be taking notes). The key takeaways will be identified in the lecture through boxes (hard copies of the powerpoints screw with physical note-takers like myself, though).\n\nThe second drawback is the lack of statistical discipline by the professor at times. There has been some confusion when the professor uses terms that are not correct in a statistical sense (goodness-of-fit vs. predicting power) early in the course that screwed with lectures later in the course. During this semester, a couple of the videos could have been re-recorded due to some mistakes (I expect this to improve over the course of multiple iterations).\n\nAgain, overall a good course to learn a few powerful, easy-to-understand models and a fairly reasonable class in terms of workload to pair with a perhaps more workload intensive class.",

While its primary focus was more on the underlying mechanism of commonly-used packages in python, the course was nonetheless effective when getting students to think about what was required to succeed in the space.\n\nAs stated before, during the Spring 2018 semester there was a massive disconnect between the homework assignments and the exams. There were three exams, all of which were open-source barring collaboration with people (but open-google, short of posting your ask on stackoverflow). However, the exams consisted basically of 6 homework assignments for you to complete in as much detail as possible. Exam 1 (24 hour max) was quite reasonable as the first few homeworks were very easy and were more on the programming, but Exams 2 (24 hour max) and 3 (36 hour max) ended up being harder variants of the homework problems to be done in a shorter period of time. I still aced the class, but the exams were definitely marathons (Exam 1: 4-6 hours, Exam 2: 18 hours, Exam 3: 10 hours, but only did enough to get 80% since I'd already guaranteed my A). Future iterations of this course will probably see updated exam logistics.\n\nNonetheless, nobody said it would be easy, and all things considered it was a deep enough course to justify an intro to programming for data science at the graduate level. For this student at least, a lot was learned. \n\nBackground: Proficient in coding in other languages such as MATLAB, SQL, some other object oriented programming languages, took Regression/6501 prior to or during this course, strong calculus/linear algebra/diff eq background from engineering days.",

The course material is excellent and well-organized and the projects do a good job of reinforcing the material.  For example, we implemented MPI collectives using only send and receive operations in one lab, so that you really understood what they did before you started using them as black boxes.\n\nGetting a correct implementation of an algorithm (which isn't trivial) will get you 80 to 90 percent of the project points usually and then it takes some significant fine-tuning and experimentation to get the rest.  The test are very hard, but the problems are well-stated, unlike some other classes where the tests are hard because of ambiguity.  The TAs give generous partial credit and the Prof Vuduc gives a generous curve on top of that.  Note, however, that you're being curved against some very smart classmates due HPC's reputation as a difficult class, the fact it's not required for any specialization, and the substantial drop rate.  I would strongly recommend taking CCA or GA before this class and you need to be decent with C (taking GIOS would certainly be enough prep).",

Topics are split across different areas with technical names which I would summarize as local parallelization (OpenMP), remote parallelization (OpenMPI), and cache stuff.\n\nProjects are uniquely challenging in that correctly implementing code (IE successful sorting) will only get you partial credit - full credit requires performance goals (Either completion under a certain time or number of cache misses). I previously took IOS/AOS so I thought that would give me a leg up for projects but I still found myself scrambling to complete projects. I ended up getting full credit for all projects but it cost me - I spent ALL my free time writing code and reimplementing methods to try to get better scores.\n** MY MAJOR COMPLAINT - Though I scored full marks, other people got crazy performance gains as compared to my implementations. While the lectures and papers leading up to projects give hints as to methods to use, there aren't any official recaps to let you know what you should have done.\n\nExams are very difficult. I am not entirely sure the motivating philosophy behind them, but I suspect the goal is to \"elevate\" your understanding of course material. What I mean by this is that the questions ask you to provide algorithms/psuedocode for problems you have not seen before. When I took Advanced Operating Systems I shut myself in my room for two weeks to study material and came out with 90s - for this class I did the same and scored raw 40/50 on the exams. Curves bumped me up to passing grades but it does make me wonder what the exact point is of making things so difficult.\n\nStill, it was a fun class. The TAs are great, Professor Vuduk is great, and you will learn a lot if you put in the effort.",

Yes, we do agree diagrams will help illustrate the ideas, but it shouldn't play such a large part in grading\n- The Projects are about solving RPM problems by building an AI Agent, it sounds like a real AI project, however from my personal experience, it feels like a normal programming assignment, the `Intelligence` part is not that much...\n\nFinal Exam Drama:\n- So the prof posted final exam paper, which is a writing assignment. After three days when many people have finished the paper, they found out that the solution to one question (Q3) is available online. They took that question done and posted another version of final exam paper, many people's efforts in that question are now in void.\n- The worst part occurred in grading Q2, Q2 is a perfect example to be solved using version space as per discussed in lecture videos, it could be solved using Incremental learning concept as well, they are largely interchangeable and there is no absolutely right or wrong. Students who use version spaces concept didn't get much credit, when being questioned, the prof's response is like below\n\n```\nBriefly, the original final examination contained a specific question on version spaces using the same data as for Q1 and Q2 in the current final exam. Given that we had a question on version spaces in the original final exam, it was clear that Q2 referred to Winston's method of incremental concept learning (and not version spaces).\n```\n- So the grading principle is, because the original problem Q3 is using version spaces, thus Q2 cannot use version spaces concept. That is indeed ridiculous as Q2 and Q3 are not related, and students taking the exam shouldn't guess which concept to use based on a question that has been deleted from the paper! *Disappointed and cannot understand what they are thinking.*",

Plus two open-book, open-internet exams. It was very manageable. To do well, one just needs to stick to this simple schedule.\n\nThe course is R-based, but it assumes no knowledge of R, spending the first couple of weeks teaching it. There is no need to learn it beforehand.\n\nThe first half of the course could be called \"Intro to working with data using R\", while the latter half could be called \"Intro to Machine Learning\". It's not clear to me why it spends so much time on machine learning topics, but it does, covering subjects such as linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization.\n\nInteracting with professor Joyner is a great pleasure - he's a fantastic teacher.

First, the material is difficult to learn and takes some time to fully understand. The book and lectures do a terrible job of explaining the material (the book is vague and the lectures focus primarily on mathematically proving the theorems behind the material rather than the testable material itself).    \n\nThe second part of the challenge in this course is the way the exams and homework are graded. The rubric calls on strict adherence to very specific terminology, formatting, and nitpicks minor details. This can be frustrating because even with a mastery of the material and after solving difficult questions, you may receive a substantial markdown for trivial \"omissions\" in your solution.\n\nAs you go through this course, I would encourage you to stick with it even if you're receiving poor grades. I did very poorly on the first two exams and still managed to pull through. The very first test is the trickiest... it gets a little bit easier after that. Grades are curved pretty significantly too. Worst case, at least you'll get to see all of the material before taking the class a second time, so you'll be better prepared the next round.\n\nKeys to success:    \n-Take this class by itself, it's really tough    \n-Practice problems from the text book and homework on a whiteboard or on paper over and over again.     \n-If you have time before the course starts, brush up on Dynamic Programming (DP)... it is the most heavily weighted topic that takes the most time to master.    \n-In regards to DP:  focus your efforts on variations of LIS, LCS, and Knapsack type problems... there's no need to get more complicated than that    \n-Pay very close attention to the details of the professor's solutions (such as HW solutions) and make your solutions follow his particular format and verbiage    \n-Don't blow off the project: it's free points... it only takes a couple days to tackle & it'll be in python most likely.    \n-Youtube videos with graphical depictions of the algorithms in action really help\n\nI wish you the very best of luck!!",

            "text": "I believe the difficulty of this class is very much related to your preparedness. I generally enjoy math and also took an algos class on Coursera a couple years ago, and I thought the course was highly enjoyable and not too difficult. If you are in a similar boat, you probably won't have much trouble with this course. On the other hand, if this is your first exposure to algorithms, I would highly recommend priming yourself for this course by taking a free algos class first, or you may find this course to be a lot of work.\n\nAnother key to this class is simply to practice a lot. A lot of the homeworks and exams come down to figuring out ways to apply the algos to a novel problem, sort of like puzzles where the algos are the tools you have to work with. Once you are in this mindset, though, it's pretty fun thinking of ways to solve the problems.\n\nOne last note about this course is that the instructional staff is excellent. Compared to other courses I've taken, Dr. Vigoda is much more active on Piazza. Probably the second-most instructor participation of any course after SDP. Dr. Vigoda was very occasionally a bit snippy here and there, but I'd rather have massive presence with occasional errors than a total lack of presence which seems to be the norm (or at least the median) for OMSCS courses. There were also several TAs that were also active and helpful, more than any other class I've taken. Grading for all homeworks and exams took less than one week (though the project took over a month) which is critically important from a pedagogical standpoint, yet virtually unheard of in this program, so major kudos to the staff in this regards.",

The lectures were very clear and well paced. The exams were very much in the spirit of the lectures and were not difficult, although you should study for about week in preparation.\n\nAdditionally, the main TA, Nolan, was incredible. He was very attentive, caring, quick to respond and knowledgable. I was surprised by the amount of collaboration and camaraderie among the class. The other TAs were almost inactive (as far as I could tell. May have done things behind the scenes), however, Nolan was so good it didn't matter.\n\nThe only thing that could be improved were the projects. Each project was essentially running a simulated processor with a test program, tweaking the inputs of the processor, and seeing how it performed differently. Then, there would be a code section were you alter the code of the processor and see how it performs.\n\nThe first section taught me a lot about processors, however, the code portion was more tedious than informative. This is because the simulator is a huge C++ code base that is somewhat poorly written. Most of the time involved in the projects is trying to understand what the code is currently doing. The feedback loop is also very long because running the simulation normally takes about 30 minutes real time.\n\nThe saving grace here is that the TAs allow you to compare results on _a simulation other than the one for the project_. So you can know for sure if you have the right answer.\n\nThis could all be mitigated if the instructions gave you more direct guidance. \"Edit function, foo, so that it does x instead of y.\"\n\nOverall, though, good class, great TA(s).",

Only complaint was that it was never clear what made the best/fastest approach. It would have been nice to see what others did to get better performance.\n\nThe exams were absolutely insane, and not in a good way.

Given an entire weekend you might be able to solve all problems given, but in two hours just try to maximize the points you can get. The only real saving grace to the exams are a significant curve.

YMMV on the TAs.\n* Final project is potentially HARD, depending on what you choose.  Over this period of time I spent around 120 hours on it over 2.5 weeks, on top of working full time, and still did not end up with a product I was very proud of.\n\n**Likes**\n* Concepts were really fun.  Useful for applications from robotics to search to AR, etc...\n* We did learn a lot.\n* Final project option included convolutional neural networks, which are close to the state of the art in the field.  Most grad classes start with \"historically important\" primitive concepts that are then built up into larger, better systems, and never get to the true state of the art in the field.  It was awesome to have the option to learn about these a bit.\n\n**Bottom Line**\nHard class, big time commitment, learned a lot, would still take again.",

            "text": "### tl;dr\nChallenging & fun course. Great material. Course management: not great but not terrible.\n\n### Overall\nThis was my first semester in OMSCS. And my first college course in 20 or so years. I found the lectures pretty engaging overall. I had no experience with CV, no linear algebra since HS, limited experience with Python, numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras, so I learned a lot in this course. The problem sets were challenging. The specifications could have been clearer. I really struggled with the second problem set and wondered if I was cut out for the class. Then I discovered the Slack channel. Saved my life. Seeing how others approached the problem sets (and how they interpreted the sometimes vague, sometimes incorrect assignments) helped me not get too far into the weeds.\n\n### Problem sets\nA lot of the problem sets, at the heart of it, were translating formulas (and occasional algorithm flowcharts) to Python. Sometimes I understood the fundamentals, sometimes it was straight up transcription.\n\n### Course Management & Piazza\nPiazza was pretty much a dumpster fire. Hard to believe anyone would choose it as a tool. TAs were occasionally helpful, often terse. Lots of questions went unanswered. Trying to navigate Piazza made it not worth trying to get help. Prof. Essa was in absentia until the very end when people got upset. He was also disingenuous by suggesting he told TAs not to reply so students would help each other out. I'd have believed that if it wasn't offered as a *post-hoc* excuse. \n\n### Final project\nThe final project (I chose the CNN one) was very challenging. I learned a crap ton, even though my results were pretty much worthless. I thought I might have tanked it but ended up getting 100%. Probably because I documented it well in the paper. And because I did a lot of research up front and tried to base my approach on current research.\n\n### Exam\nExam was challenging but not terrible. Open book. Which was helpful. I spent a good half-day reviewing the lecture transcripts (helpfully put together by a fellow Slacker) and the lecture slides. Lots of `ctrl-f` of course. Managed to eke out a B on the final and a high B for the course. That included slacking for a week of vacation and getting a 61% on one of the problem sets.\n\n### Advice\n1. Make sure your linear algebra and calculus fundamentals are strong. It will help you truly understand the material.\n1. Make sure you have a pretty solid basis for numpy, especially how slicing and reshaping and such works. Lean on numpy vs. for loops.\n1. Spend a few hours at the start of the course getting a high level view of the history and current topics in CV.\n\n*note: my workload is based on actual measurements. I spent 171 hours on this course total including administrative work like registration, watching lectures, reading research papers, problem sets, peer review, final project, exam, time on Slack*",

This class was very active on Piazza and most of my general questions were asked and answered by other students. I did however have a specific code question and sent a private post to my assigned TA but received no response. \n\nThe first half of the course teaches the basics of R and how to model data. This was really helpful because I had no experience with R coming into this course. The second half of the course teaches a few machine learning techniques. I think this is a great course to take before you take the harder machine learning courses. \n\nThe homeworks in the first half of the course were very easy and fun because you get to play with R to create all kinds of visuals for the data. The homeworks in the second half took longer but I felt they were valuable lessons to learn machine learning if you haven't learned it already. There were 2 projects, both of which are not hard if you dedicate the time to do them. Project 1 took much longer than project 2, but project 2 builds off of project 1 and is easy if you did well on project 1 and were able to reuse some of the code. The exams were very easy if you watched the Udacity lectures and read the course readings. Exams are open book, notes, internet (the only thing not allowed is help from another person, chat boxes, etc). The instructor tried to stick very closely to the materials provided and gave us points back for materials on the exam that were not covered or phrased misleadingly. \n\nI think the grading was very lenient on all homeworks, projects, and exams. It would be hard not to receive an A in this class.",

However, there were a few things that bothered me while I was taking the course, and I wanted to wait until it was 100% over to write them up to give others a fair warning about these aspects of the course:\n\nFirst, the open-note final exam did not feel like a good test of the things I had learned watching the lectures and doing the assignments throughout the semester. Another reviewer mentioned it felt like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", but I wanted to expand on this further. Some of the material on the exam did not come from any of the class material.   Most of the exam required finding keywords in PDFs, or a specific sentence mentioned in a lecture. Many of the questions relied on wordplay to attempt to fool the test taker (similar to the lab notebooks).\n\nSecond, the midterm, which I believe was indeed a fair assessment, should have included the grading rubric when it was released. A number of students wasted a lot of time on a portion of it that ultimately was worth much less than the other portions of the exam. Ultimately I believe this contributed to that assessment being the lowest grade overall for the class project-wise. \n\nThird, it appears reviews of the Above and Beyond portion of the assignments were mixed. You really need to attempt to do all of these if you want an 'A' in the course. Personally, I was not really a fan. I thought that while the Above and Beyond sections could produce very excellent work, grading of the sections was too subjective. These Above and Beyond sections count for about 4% of your overall grade, and getting more than half of these points seemed almost unfeasible sometimes. I understand the intention to make the course more fun and produce original pieces of work, but I think more guidelines need to be set for both the students and the graders about what qualifies as an appropriate Above and Beyond. \n\nI do not mean to dissuade others from taking this class. I really did enjoy it (doing the final project and seeing others' results was AMAZING, and all of the assignments were very well-made and fun to do). The TA's were extremely knowledgeable, active and helpful. And I've never felt so much pride in the work I've done for a class. Mostly, I just wanted to make the above writeup as a refresher to the reviews from previous semesters.\n\nP.S. Buy a tripod for your phone, and start the midterm early.",

            "text": "Similar to what a number of other posts have covered. But I would like to comment particularly on the use of Bonnie grading vs. unit tests. In numerous cases, the unit tests provided in the assignment passed only then to find that the same code failed on Bonnie. \n\nSo if you assumed you were good because supplied unit tests passed that would be a dangerous assumption, especially as you get toward the assignment submit date. What then makes matters worse is that when Bonnie fails a test the feedback is virtually useless in terms of knowing what is wrong. This is not to say that students should write additional unit tests - what I'm saying is that the unit tests provided in the assignment were dangerous in that they generated a false sense of confidence. \n\nSo overall a course that covers a lot of interesting content but as others have said there was too many topics covered in the course and it could be split into smaller courses. This would provide the ability for students to learn the material more thoroughly. \n\nThe TA support was mediocre. I realize that TA's have their own projects which take their time but when a student takes time to ask a well thought out question, replies from TA's like 'yes' and 'no' don't really cut it. That is if the overriding goal of OMSCS is to spread learning and knowledge about all these new topics.\n\n\n",

I wish there were a sequel because it left me wanting more.\n\nThere are 4 timed proctored exams and they are 85% of your grade. To prepare, get the \"Algorithms\" Dasgupta book and do all the exercises at the end of the chapters. The exams are problem solving questions similar to those. All chapters are covered by the course except the last 2.  I also found the CLR book useful at times as supplement.\n\nThe most important thing to do in advance in terms of preparation for the course is to become skilled at Dynamic Programming. The first exam comes fast, and many students get such a devastatingly low score due to inability to solve the DP problems that they can never recover.\n\nThe partial credit on exams is generous -- too generous maybe -- so whatever happens, make sure to write something.\n\nThis course ought to be required for every specialization.

Probably, in part, due to the fact the professor changed from the the time the video content was created.  I thought a disproportional emphasis was put into UML versus SW architecture and design topics. Group project towards the end of the semester is interesting, but if you find yourself in a bad team you may be in trouble as the team project accounts for 20% of your entire grade. Also on grading, it took the teaching body a long time to grade assignments, which can be a problem as, since some of the assignments sort of build on each other, if you make mistakes on an early assignment, you may get penalized for the same mistake on a later assignment. However, grading seemed very reasonable and methodical overall. It was my first course on the program, and one I thought to be a good intro to it after the fact. Probably worth taking it, but don't expect much learning if you work as a SW engineer on your day job; however, as others already alluded to, it is a Graduate course and you get what you put in. ",

Either you seem to hate it or love it. I personally hated it. It's my first OMSCS course, so I have little to compare it to. \n\n<b>Pros:</b>\n<ul><li>The class is extremely easy. The first quarter of the class is basically an introduction to R and an overview of the difference between scatter-plots and box-plots. If you can't pull an A, or at least a B, a master's program may not be right for you at this time. </li>\n<li>Dr. Joyner does seem to care about his students and this program. While he seemed overwhelmed at times, you could tell that he cared and wanted everyone to succeed. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Cons: </b>\n<ul><li> The homework/assignments/exams are poorly written. This is especially true for both the midterm and final exam, which had quite a few questions that could have multiple answers depending on the interpretation of what was actually being asked. A few students started a mini Piazza \"revolt\" where they threatened to escalate issues with the class/midterm if their grievances weren't answered (ironically, they then learned that the person to escalate these issues to for OMSCS is Dr. Joyner).    </li>\n<li> There are a lot of helpful TAs, but they never seemed to be on the same page. There were multiple instances where I would get two very different answers to the same question from different TAs. For example, multiple TAs said on Piazza and Slack that homework had to be done in LaTeX to receive credit. However, when they posted \"exemplary homeworks\" one student had literally hand written his homework, taken pictures with his phone, and cut/pasted the images into a word document.</li>\n<li> The lectures are hilariously bad. It's like they were made in some dystopian future where everyone must speak in a monotone voice and ideas can only be expressed through Word 2010 clip art. More importantly, some of the required readings have massive errors. I was pretty disappointed that this course has been going on for multiple years, and this hasn't been fixed. I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out Dr. Lebanon's logistic regression proof, only to realize (about two hours in) that it's just wrong. </li></ul>\n\nOverall, if you want an easy A or want to learn R, take this class.

            "text": "Very deceptive course. Most of the materials for the course is from academic papers. The lectures do no justice in explaining the papers or setting the students up for success. The poor jokes of the professors make it even worse. The 3 projects in this course are mostly based on academic papers, which you have to read and replicated without much help. The TAs were kind enough to help on few of the homeworks and projects. Extremely hard final. I did take this course after taking ML (scoring an A in it). Personally I learned more from ML4T than ML and RL combined. Though the content taught in this course is interesting, there is not much practical applications possible (not a popular field at the moment). It would be better to take BD4H instead of RL as it will give you some hands-on experience for working in the industry.",

            "text": "<b>OVERVIEW</b>\n\nEssentially, the course serves as an introduction to Machine Learning, Technical Analysis for Trading, and Python (including Pandas and Numpy). If you're new to ML, Technical Analysis, or Python, this is an excellent first course. While the material effectively covers material sufficient for an introduction, you are free to take your learning further. For example, when learning about Reinforcement Learning, you can simply watch the course videos, or you can supplement your learning by reading the relevant sections from Suttons' book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction and the videos from the OMSCS Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning courses. The approach you take, combined with the skills you begin with, will determine how much time you spend on the course.\n\n<b>PROJECTS AND EXAMS</b>\n\nThe projects build upon one another, so if you get something wrong it is critical that you go back and fix it. Also, beginning projects early is extremely useful, because some projects require experimentations and papers. I was surprised at how a few students would appear on Piazza or Slack a few days before the project was due proclaiming that they had not started the assignment and was asking how long it would take to complete. Again, the approach you take will determine how much you get from the class.\n\n<b>ENGAGEMENT</b>\n\nI found the unofficial Slack community the most active - 24/7, especially in the days leading up to a project's due date or an exam. In many cases, students would answer questions in minutes or hours. Piazza was also useful, where some TAs were very active. Although, unlike Slack, answers from TAs or the professor ranged from minutes to days. I found my TA quite good and he would pull in other TAs when he couldn't provide a definitive answer. The professor was active on Piazza for the first half of the course, but was sparsely present during the second. Fortunately, the course proceeded smoothly with the head TA (who has previously taught the course) and other TAs actively participating.\n\n<b>TIPS</b>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Begin projects early</li>\n<li>Read a few research papers so that you can write your reports in a similar style</li>\n<li>View the course as an introduction and feel free to go as deep as your interest takes you</li>\n</ol>",

            "text": "Personal background: This is my first semester and I paired with course with Computer Vision. I don't have formal CS educational background or software engineering working experience. I have been programming with Python for a year or so to prepare for the application of OMSCS. I have taken college maths classes (which I dont think is used in this course).\n\nAbout the class materials: The lectures are very interesting and well structured. Probably not wide/deep enough. But the research challenge arranged by the instructor provided good opportunities for self-exploration and learning from each other. It is a pity that I did not spend much time on it. The hardware challenge also seems very interesting. I am not a hardware person myself but the things classmates posts are really impressive. \n\nAbout the instructor: The instructor Jay is very nice and effective. He almost answered/hinted every question on piazza. In a few cases when I twisted my wording to hide my stupidity when asking questions, he seemed to understand my intention and hinted on my confusion directly. I really appreciate his efforts in running this class well.\n\nAbout the projects: Project 3 is challenging. There are too many details that can mess things up. I decided to give it up to get a B but the deadline was extended.  So I \"had to\" work on it for another week and eventually I scored 6 out of 10 test cases and managed to get a A. (I lost 4 points because my solution was not designed to deal with certain situations due to lack of energy).\n\nMy lesson from project 3 is\n\n1) you need to really understand what SLAM is doing exactly in each step (same for the other algorithms taught in the class) . Only after that you can correctly modify the implementation. It seems a lot of classmates claimed that there is bug in the SLAM code. But it did work, at least for some other classmates and me. \n\n2) read and participate in the discussions on piazza. I had to make numerous decisions for the project and I did not have the time/patient to try them out. For learning purposes I listed the pros and cons for my options but most of my decisions are based on the comments from the instructors and other classmates. Sometimes even 'typing' the question helped me figure out the answer immediately. I heard from the instructor that it is called \"Rubberduck debugging\".\n\nFirst class?\nIf you know python and know how to plan to \"solve a problem\" and execute your plan, I think you should be fine. For me, most of the difficulties of Project 3 in the first two weeks came from my messed up code and code structure, which made it very difficult to debug.",

            "text": "The course is a broad survey of ML & is a nice introduction to the topic. It covers to a decent depth all the 3 learning techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning). The video lectures are very informal & at times highly entertaining. But one needs to be very attentive (& make good notes) since a lot of the questions from midterm & finals are based on the conversations between Prof. Isbell & Prof. Littman. The TA's are engaged and hold regular office hours. Prof Isbell is very active on Piazza & show tremendous patience to the almost repetitive & very annoying questions (some of them seem to simply not use the search feature before posting questions - this can be really painful for a large class like ML). The 4 assignments are meant to let the students do a detailed analysis based on the application of learning techniques, tuning hyper parameters etc on different datasets (of our choosing) & provide right justifications for all our choices. The feedback can be at times very detailed & some times not so thorough(depends on individual grading TA). It can be subjective but most of the time based on well defined rubric. Your analysis can be as independent & informal but cover what's expected. I managed to score pretty high on these (overall above 90%) with a couple of centuries. And this saved me some grace from what was nothing but disaster of a midterm...\nProf. Isbell makes it very clear(repeatedly) that he cares the least when it comes to code for all the analysis & the only thing that matters is good analysis. You can re-use existing code (cite references).\nThe exams are closed book, without any pen/paper etc and expects short concise answers. The idea is to test the understanding of the concepts on many of the topics covered in lectures.\nOverall a fantastic class & personally didn't find it as hard as advertised in discussion forums. ",

            "text": "This course never claims to be similar to Stanford CS231n. It mostly teaches traditional (real) computer vision with machine learning element in some topics. (So I was a bit surprised that now it is a course of ML specialization). Personally I like this aspect more. There are a lot of smart ideas which inspire my ways of thinking. \n\nLinear algebra (a rough idea about what's happening) and numpy skills (vectorized operation) will help you with this course. And Be patient.\n\nRegarding the comment below that \"He openly stated he told TAs not to help students with questions\", I think the professor means(and he did say) that he encourages discussions instead of feeding you answers directly. My observation is that if I ask \"will I be punished if I use this function in my assignment\", TA will answer it very fast. But if I ask \"is algorithm A/parameter A better than algorithm B/parameter B for this assignment/project\", usually I will not get an answer from the TAs directly (but usually this issue has been discussed somewhere else in the post). I understand it might be a pain if you are rushing to a deadline but I think it's fair for effective learning. I learnt a lot by discussing problems with other classmates. But of course it would be better if TA/professor can give some conclusion remarks on some of the discussions. \n\nOverall after taking the course I respect computer vision more as a science.  I am glad the course is not designed to be an opencv or tensorflow tutorial.",

            "text": "This was a great introduction to OS course.  I have no background in C and I have never taken an OS course before.  I tried to take this course over a year ago and ended up dropping it because I could not keep up.  This time around I prepared a couple months in advance by reading through Learn C the hard way and completing all of the C courses on Lynda.  \n\nUse the class Slack channel.  The TA's for this class are amazing and will always help you.  They don't give you answers but they can point you down the right path.  We had other students in the class with experience in some of the areas and they helped out in Piazza and in the Slack channel as well. Between the projects, TA's, and other students, there is a huge wealth of knowledge to gain in this class.  Then add on the papers and lectures and its almost too much.  \n\nThe TA's were very active on Piazza as well.  The instructor held weekly office hours to answer any questions about the projects, lectures, papers, or tests.\n\nProject 1 is really not that bad if you keep it simple, which is harder then it sounds when you're new to this subject.  Its easy to over think the problem and create a mess but the project is really pretty straight forward.  One of the main focuses of the project is multi threading.\n\nProject 2 was extra credit for us.  It had no programming but was a written assignment to design an experiment.\n\nProject 3 was the toughest.  It was a bit more free form in that you could design your program to work many different ways.  Its best to plan this project out before you start programming it.  I jumped right into programming and that was a mistake.  I still did very well on the project but I could have saved myself many hours if i would have designed before programming.  Shared memory and multi threading are some focuses here.\n\nProject 4 was the easiest.  Again its really straight forward but I can see it being another project that is easy to over think and make difficult for yourself.  This one dealt with RPC and multi threading.\n\nI found the mid term and final to be the most difficult part of the class.  You have to read all of the papers and watch all of the lectures and really understand the material in order to do well on the exams.  \n\nI stayed within the class average for the mid term and did very very bad on the final.  I got almost a 100 percent on the all the projects and did the extra credit.  Walked away with a B in the class.\n\nMy background is 1 year as system tech, 3 years of COBOL on a mainframe and almost 2 years now in Java doing full stack.",

You can also do all of the readings assigned and independent research and expand on the projects on your own and learn a lot more.  This class is the epitome of you get out of it what you put in.\n\nI really enjoyed the projects.  They are not heavy on the programming but more of puzzles.  Projects included C, Python, Javascript, and reading PHP.  You only need to do very basic tasks in these languages and you don't need a deep knowledge in any of them.\n\nI even enjoyed reading through the book and I can't really say that about any other class.  I must like the subject matter. :)  \n\nThe exams are not difficult if you watch the lectures and do the readings.  The exams are very similar to the quizzes you take weekly.  The quizzes are open book.",

You might ace all the homeworks like me but they mean little (only 30% of your grade). The projects are worth the most (45%) and they take a LOOONG time to get right. First, it takes a long time to understand how to implement them. Then you have to test them, which being machine learning, also takes a long time. Then once you know they work, you need to run them for long periods of time to get the results you need for the analysis. Please don't wait. The analysis isn't bad for each project (only 5 pages each) but obviously you want your code to work properly first. I hate the fact that they didn't release them all at once. I really would have liked working ahead. They only give you 2 weeks for each project and that's a shame. Overall, the course was incredibly interesting and well taught.

You'll get to learn about some low level, classical OS material and get into more modern ideas supporting concurrency, virtualization and distributed systems. Some of the lectures are pretty dense, so you'll probably want to watch them in pieces rather than all at once. There were 3 projects and an extra credit project this semester, and they were all in C. If you don't know C already, this is where the bulk of your difficulty in the class will come from. Some of the code templates given used syntax and operators I'd never seen before, and this created a lot of difficulty for me. If you're well versed in C and navigating Linux man pages already, you're probably fine. Exams were tricky, but I didn't find them exceptionally hard despite their reputation. The course is curved, and the boundaries seemed pretty generous. If you mess up more than one project you can still walk away with a B if your exam scores are above average. \n\nTAs are pretty responsive on Piazza, but don't rely on them to help you at the last minute - ask early and you should be good. Project grades take a long time to return, but this semester had an unusually high number of students so I kind of expected this going in. Make sure to pass Bonnie tests - they seem highly correlated with the end grade of your projects. \n\nThere was also a very active course Slack this semester where you can get fast help if the TAs are online. Professor Gavrilovska holds office hours every week (not just the TAs), so you can get help there too. I'd recommend this course early if you're looking into the Computing Systems specialization and need to brush up on low level OS material, but be warned - it's a deceptive amount of work.

I had next to zero algorithms background, but the topic is everywhere in CS and I wanted to fill in a lot of knowledge gaps by taking a supposedly-more-practical-than-CCA algorithms class, and I got it here. There were 3 exams and a final, 1 project, and homework. Exams were about the same level of difficulty as the homework, so the best advice I could give is to practice doing problems a lot, especially with Dynamic Programming and NP-completeness reductions. If you want an A in this class, you will work for it - exams are regularly 4/5 problems worth 25/20% each, so if you mess one up, there goes your grade. \n\nTAs are really responsive, and the lectures are very well done. I found them exceptionally clear if you pay attention, and more straightforward than textbooks in terms of the explanations on average, but not always (compared to Dasgupta and CLRS). The class was exceptionally well run, and this was probably the biggest factor in my passing at all - homework and exam solutions (though not the final exam) were released the day after the submission window was closed, so you can figure out where the differences were, and learn from your mistakes immediately. There were office hours all the time, though I didn't attend them regularly. \n\nIf you're wondering whether or not to take this, I'm going to recommend it highly. It's hard and time consuming, but it'll enhance your experience in other courses. For example: my section of Reinforcement Learning used Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming throughout the semester, and my (admittedly old) Computer Networks section had a Bellman-Ford project. All of these topics are covered in depth in GA, and will probably be significantly easier with prior exposure to them. It's hard to get in because all but one degree specializations currently require it, but keep at it and you'll be glad you did.",

            "text": "Wow! This class is rough. It is written up as a survey class in AI but I'd say some of the work is probably harder than alot of specialized classes in specific subjects similar. I went in knowing little about AI and came out knowing a bunch of algorithms but not to much on how to put it all together.\n\nThe videos: well done and think it was smart to use others lectures when appropriate to explain concepts. Sometimes someone else explained it quite good, why reinvent the wheel and like this design in the lectures. However, especially when Thad was teaching, there were somewhat of a very light explanation of really complicated subject matter not well explained. Thad is clearly very intelligent and sometimes takes for granted the intelligence or former knowledge of his audience.\n\nThe book: You are expected to read this whole gargantuan book. It is dense and really really hard to follow. The algorithms given in book are in most cases better explained elsewhere, for example in the authors own videos. I learned multiple concepts better by watching videos elsewhere then I ever did this book. My eyes glazed over when I looked at it many times and found watching youtube videos on concepts way more productive.\n\nThe projects: Time consuming and difficult. All the projects came with unit test which many times did a horrible job of actually testing your code. This also led you in a false sense of security especially when Bonnie submissions were limited. Bonnie submissions on some projects were unlimited but limited on others. Also, the feedback from Bonnie was usually unhelpful. Many times you were being forced to write a complicated algorithm from scratch even though the algorithm existed elsewhere. You would write it and it would seem to work with the crappy unit test you had. However, Bonnie wouldn't like it and you would be stuck with WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG HERE? You would spin your wheels for hours and hours trying to find a bug with no idea what was wrong. Again, you are implementing an algorithm you didn't write and purely in math form that was really complicated. If your are unfamiliar with the math symbols, etc, it could get you. And so you would have 8 lines of code where there was a bug but sometimes you just couldn't figure it out. Now here is the other problem. For some reason there were a number of people who did really well on the projects. So, he grades based on median being an A and 1 stddev being a B. However, the median would most times end up being a 100%. So, good luck with that. Note, the median is done at the end of class so the test bring down the medians to a nicer range, but it can be quite frustrating to learn that your 95% or 90% on a project is a B. Dropping the last one is also done in the median calculation so it actually makes the standard deviation get smaller.\n\nThe test: Ridiculous. You are given a week and are take home. They are so much calculation and so easy to make a simple calculation error. The midterm took me around 40 hours and the final around 60 hours. I took three days off work for the final otherwise I wouldn't have been able to complete. It is really dumb too, cause it doesn't test ones ability to understand the concept but rather one's ability to do the math by hand. I ended up purchasing a scientific calculator as you have to have it to do the math. The other dumb thing is the test is open book but the internet is off limits. This means you can't use easier to follow explanations of an algorithm on spots like Wikipedia you had to use the confusing books explanations. This is another reason you had to use a calculator alot to do things like log10(x**(y/t)). And you would lose half credit for rounding incorrectly to the 6 decimal point. Test became about doing complicated calculations rather than understanding concepts and I found to be the most useless part of this class. Note, I got B's on the midterm and final median was 78.65% and 67.8%. \n\nThe TAs: Overall pretty helpful but many times refused to help on certain things I believe as ordered by the Prof. Also, no help during test and had a now work on weekend policy which was super annoying since everything was due on Sunday. Never seen that rule before.\n\nOverall, the class is educational but don't think I could carry it into a good understanding of how to use AI in the world. I wish there was less focus on the math and more on the ideas which is what I thought a survey class would do. Maybe I should have taken ML which is I think more about the ideas and what they mean. I spend way more hours on this class then in any other I have taken previously yet my grade doesn't reflect that. So, take the class but know what you are in for. Be prepared to make sure your job isn't going to have any overnight emergencies or anything. There were many who didn't struggle as much as I did so ymmv but and I did go in very green. However, I have gone into other classes green and didn't struggle like I did in this one.\n\n",

            "text": "I took this course along with Intro to Operating systems and ML and eventually dropped ML after mid-term. My comments are mixed. First of all this is a graduate course, some topics on computer science are vague and does not have formal algorithms or proofs to learn from, this is one such course. You will apply your computer science skills on this course, so like others mentioned here lecture videos are shallow, skimmed through and covered lot of topics.  If you are research oriented, curious to dig through then this course is for you.  Its overwhelming to do 10 quizzes, 1 final and 5 projects. If you are new to security you will spend lot of time like me but in the end you will feel that you learned something from projects.  Initially i had to juggle 3 courses, so i ended up blowing up on 1 assignment which had a big impact on my grades. TAs were very comfortable on regrade requests and did their best. It appears that materials have changed from past semesters, so if you are new to computer security and expect to learn from course videos and apply it to projects, you are not going to like this course. Its true that professor did not show up but i doubt that it would have made any difference due to the nature of the course. If you have hacking mindset and willing to dig through and learn on your own then you will enjoy this course. Don't assume this course is going to be easy, be prepared to put in solid effort if you care for good grade. In terms of programming language, this course needs some understanding on C, javascript, html, python and firewall rules",

For learning R, the course provides sufficient time to learn the language and I also heavily used the DataCamp “Data Analyst with R” track and it made the homework’s and projects a breeze. To tackle algebra and calculus, I referred to Khan Academy. Both these resources are more than sufficient to prepare for the course. \n\n The homework’s, projects and activates are announced up front so that we can plan about them. Make sure you do all the activities since they are extra credits and help if one of the homework or project does not go well. The grading is lenient and it is not difficult to score an A. I think this is a great course to take first up in the program.",

There were some outstanding TAs in this course, who were generally available to guide students on projects and the concepts underlying them. However, when it came to matters of policy and offering a cohesive message on things that came up, particularly in terms of graded content, there was no unified voice, and sometimes questions would go unanswered. \nThere were some minor snags endured because the course switched from TSquare to Canvas but those were teeny and inconsequential. However, a few times, things that should not have mattered turned into frustrating issues because no one would address them.  This was my fifth course in the program, and I'm not convinced that this frustration is rooted in an unreasonable expectation of course organization and leadership.

It's very easy to spend 20-30 hours on each project assignment. Study hard for each exam, and definitely reach Mitchell's textbook in addition to the supplemental material (you can skim papers, but make sure you understand them). If you have pre-canned code to run, this can greatly reduce your assignment time. I found myself writing a lot of my own code, so perhaps I could have saved countless hours if I knew which experiment to run beforehand.\n\nML is a very fair course, and they grade harshly per assignment and exam but do curve up. If you do better than the mean, you'll probably get an A. I screwed up the first assignment because I underestimated the time it took and sent it half complete (no extensions). I did at mean or better afterwards on everything, and it all worked out. They will be reasonable if you do poorly on the first assignment, but demonstrate an upward trajectory afterward.\n\nI took ML and ML4T at the same time, which had some overlap, but I found myself spending every weekend alternating between the two classes. I'd recommend taking ML alone if you're also working full time on a demanding job. I did get A's in both, but I also lost nearly every weekend for 3+ months.",

To compare it against even the 2nd most challenging class is a huge difference and to be honest this is probably the difficulty level all classes should be for this program.\n\nIf you are taking this class you really need to mentally prepare yourself for the time consuming workload that lays ahead of you.   The class gives you no time to breathe.  Even from day one you need to watch all of the lectures and get started on the first assignment which is due in 3 weeks.  After that you have 3 weeks until the next one is due, then you have 2 weeks until the midterm.  This pattern repeats all the way to the end.  You will never have a week off.\n\nThe assignments are not difficult to code, but very time consuming.  This is because the lectures go over the theory and math behind the algorithms and its up to you to figure out how to actually code them (using libraries.)  One positive is that you can actually steal code.  Yes, you heard that right.  You can Google someone else's code and use it if you want.  I know many people just used the code some previous students created for the class and this is perfectly fine.  I actually coded all 4 assignments myself and learned a lot.\n\nThe biggest problem with this class as others on here have mentioned is you have no idea how well you are doing or if you are even going to pass the class.  Until final grades came out I thought I was going to get a C and was prepared to take the class over again.  I did well on all four assignments (82, 79, 92, 90) which were all above the class mean, but completely bombed the midterm and final (34, 49) and somehow managed to get an A with the huge curve.\n\nIf you are going to take this class, get as much knowledge about ML as you can by pre-watching the class lectures on Udacity, or take one of the many ML courses such as the Andrew NG ML class from Stanford.\n\nOverall this class was great.  It was a ton of work but I learned a lot and will be continuing to study ML and will possibly be thinking about a career change to go into this field.",

The homework assignments and projects were fairly time consuming for me because I didn't know R at all, but they were interesting and I learned a lot. Some weeks I spent 10-15 hours, other weeks I spent 0 because there was only a small extra credit assignment due. I found it fairly easy to get an A.\n\nI watched the lectures religiously early on, but later on I found the class discussions and google to be much more helpful. The TAs were helpful, but honestly I found the other students to be the most helpful. The professor was more of a manager of the TAs than a professor, but that's fine.\n\nI was intimated by the requirements of linear algebra and calculus since I am many years removed from college, but it didn't turn out to be that bad.

So you may end up paying more attention to the lectures related to the project and skim the rest. The project implementation goes hand in hand with the lectures. Everything you need are in those wonderful Bobick lectures. Aaron Bobick's lectures are great. He keeps the topics engaging and breaks it down into understandable segments.

One topic that was genuinely missing was deep learning methods like CNN, R-CNN (supervised learning SVM is part of the course). \n\nYou have 5 choices for your final project.

For my class, our 2 midterms each took an average of upwards of 15 hours (we got 24 hours, but it was still quite absurd). Surprisingly, the final only took me 6, even though we got 36 hours to complete it. The exams and homeworks were open book/note with no online proctoring. The only restriction was that we couldn't ask our classmates for help, so I must say that despite my complaint, I can't really say anything was unfair. \n\nI took the course together with ISYE 6501 (Introduction to analytics modeling) and it was kind of neat because we would code up a lot of the algorithms discussed in the modeling course. \n\nThis course is comprised of lectures and Jupyter notebooks. Lectures are well designed as well as homeworks (You get 1 per week and each one took me a few hours to complete with the tv running in the background, nothing crazy). As far as autograders go, I've had much worse experiences than the one in this course. Learning to debug is extremely important, and you will certainly gain some experience in this course. \n\nIn terms of course content, this is what I imagine is taught at the Python 101 level,  with a sprinkle of harder topics. Many of the weeks went something like: \"Here is an analytics technique/algorithm. Code it in Python. Python already has a built-in function for it, this is how that call goes...\" This is actually a pretty good way to learn, because you essentially teach yourself the way that some of Python's functions work by coding them manually thus giving yourself a good introduction to Python, programming in general and the analytics models.",

It was not too difficult, but it did require me to put in about 10 hours per week on average. Dr. Moss and the a couple TAs were very involved in the course and I feel like they communicated very well compared to what I've heard about in other courses. The course was organized and well-run.\n\nThere were no tests, just assignments, which included a group project in the final 3-4 weeks. The main assignments were 2 design documents using UML, an approx. 6-7 page (double-spaced) research paper, and and the final group project. There were of course the Udacity videos and some required readings, but the readings did not count as part of a grade. The content was fairly interesting, but I felt like a little too much emphasis was put on UML and not enough on architectural styles. You can't really work ahead on the assignments as they are released at specified times.",

The course material is interesting and the professor understands it well, but the lectures often were a little convoluted and hard to follow.

I believe this is the first time this class has been offered online. After another semester or two, once the kinks are worked out, I could see this being a very good class.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this class was definitely with the first (group) project. It felt like my group spent as much time trying to parse the project description and figure out the project requirements as actually complete the project. On the last weekend before it was due, we probably spent a combined 45-50 man-hours (on a 3-person team) trying to complete it and still didn't finish. I think the instructors realized that the project was more difficult than they anticipated, because they ended up grading it very generously (I received full credit even though the project was incomplete). The second project was also much more reasonable.",

The class was pretty basic, with the exception of homework #3 which was very calculus heavy (which I have no experience with) and there wasn't much explanation for the math needed. For the rest of the class it was very easy, mostly just homework assignments where you had to shuffle data into different formats and then use libraries to display the data.\n\nOne frustrating aspect was that homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. They often took 3-6 weeks to be graded. Part of the problem was that several TAs had accidents or unplanned events happen and so other semesters of this class may not experience such a long delay.\n\nI also wish that there had been more helpful feedback on assignments, usually they just marked the number of points you missed with a short comment to what section was wrong, but the comments were usually very cryptic.\n\nDr. Joyner was very kind when you approached him with grading questions and there were several times when an assignment would be awarded points because there were several students that missed a single question or because something wasn't very clear.\n\nOn average I spent 7 hours and 48 minutes per week, but there were some weeks where I did a lot more than others and the range is from 1:20 to 16:41 (that was one of the project 2 weeks).\n\nI would recommend studying calculus (which is does mention on the course info page) before homework 3, but other than that this was a pretty easy class.",

            "text": "This is great introduction to ML (Logistic and Linear Regression). If you have any back ground in this topic then the class is very easy. Essentially the class teaches you how to use R in a very gentle manner. \n\nThere were 5% extra credit on offer. \n\nThe class has been significantly improved since Dr. Joyner took over. I had no complains as the class was run extremely well. This class can easily be done with another easy or medium difficulty class. \n\nThe projects and HWs were well thought out and lead from one to the other in a systematic manner. Finally the exams were easy multiple choice with open everything. So the class was essentially an Easy A class. \n\nI would recommend that all new starters thinking of doing ML specialization do this course as it has been significantly improved. You can ignore all the old bad reviews.  ",

I watched all the lectures, did all the assignments, and tried my hardest to gain some value from the course, but it was pretty futile. The professor is completely disengaged and unfortunately, the main TA this year was pretty rude and unforgiving to a lot of people who asked questions on Piazza. I would rate this course a Very Hard in terms of understanding what is actually expected of you, but Easy in terms of actual content.\n\nHonestly, the assignments were not challenging as long as you read every single Piazza post, even if there were dozens. Because I did not do that and just did the assignments as outlined on the assignment description (generally taking around 10 hours for each assignment), without fail, I would receive anywhere from 50-70% on every assignment, and then be forced to request a regrade and claw back points. Every regrade gave me 20+ points, so they are definitely worth it, but it is an absolutely ridiculous process if you think about the effort TAs have to put in to basically grade everything twice because they were not explicit in the assignment instructions the first time or their autograder was just wrong. \n\nYou would think since this class is so poorly managed, that you would be allowed to ask clarifying questions on Piazza, but after one TA repeatedly responded in a downright rude manner to anyone's innocent questions, I decided to forgo that strategy and just rely on the obnoxious regrading requests to get an accurate grade.\n\nAlso don't expect the final to be any less vague or subjective than the quizzes you do all semester. It had many typos, many ambiguous or contentious answers, and was hands-down the worst final I have taken at OMSCS (disclaimer: I have only taken 3 other finals). If you really want to learn network security, just buy the Hacker's Playbook and skip this course.",

I work full-time and took this course along with Network Security. I pulled one allnighter for this course because I am a champion at procrastinating, and even then, I could have just used one of the two 48-hour late day passes everyone is given. I even bombed one of the first assignments and ended up with a 97% in the class with all the extra credit they give out towards the end.\n\nI test much better than my actual understanding, so I found the tests fun and engaging and both the midterm and final had a generous curve (60%->90% and 76%->100% in my case). I would recommend going over the textbook somewhat thoroughly, or at least know where the relevant sections are, since on both tests, I managed to basically transfer pseudocode from the book onto the test for an entire question. Also have the solution manual to the book handy (there's a bunch of pdfs online). On the midterm, one of the questions was almost identical to the last year's midterm solutions. \n\nIf you're worried about taking this class, just take it and stay engaged on Slack and Piazza. Since it's usually a smaller class, all the students are very helpful and the professor and TAs were phenomenal. I started some projects 2-3 days before they were due (spending about 4-7 hours a day on it) and did fine by utilizing other people's questions and answers on Piazza and Slack. I don't recommend that because every single time, I would start an assignment and panic that I wouldn't crack the algorithm in time, but you should not panic if life gets ahead of you a bit and you neglect this class for a week or two.

            "text": "Machine Learning for trading is an excellent course. It's a great starter course, as it isn't too difficult, but beware that the difficulty does ramp up towards the end of the course (though it still doesn't get exceptionally difficult) so don't let the first half fool you into thinking the second half is just as easy. Lecture material is very interesting, essentially being split into half-financial and half-intro to machine learning.\n\nThe projects all build upon one another in some way, so it's advisable to spend a sufficient amount of time making sure each one is done properly. You can work ahead, as all project descriptions and legacy code are available on the class website, BUT, the projects may change slightly closer to release so keep that in mind when you work ahead. **DO NOT** wait until projects are finalized before you start working on them, despite the chance some slight tweaks may be made to projects up to the week before it is due, start them as soon as you can. This is especially true with all of the projects starting from and including *assess_learners*. \n\nI would suggest making sure your *marketsim* project works perfectly when you get there. The most time consuming projects are *assess_learners*, *manual_strategy* and *strategy_learner*, with the latter two using your *marketsim* code, so make sure to allocate enough time to work on these when you get there. Also, for *manual_strategy* you will have to do some research into stock price indicators, and this project is used as a comparison for *strategy_learner* so it's good to choose these indicators wisely based on this research.\n\nThere are two proctored exams,  one mid-term and one non-cumulative final exam. Questions aren't difficult as long as you review all of the material, watch all of the required additional videos (e.g., The Big Short), and go over the practice questions/previous term exams where possible.\n\nAll-in-all, the material is interesting, the projects are overall well-structured and utilize the material conveyed in lecture, and often even have instructional videos to help guide you through some of the more involved projects.  TAs were responsive and easy to reach on PIazza, though Dr. Balch is often very helpful he can be a bit curt.",

There are *3 assignments*, *a 3-stage class project*, and *peer-reviews* for all assignments and project stages.\n\n**Assignments**:The 3 assignments are essentially essays that ask you to leverage class material to either a specific topic or a topic of your choosing (depending on the assignment). You often have a choice between which material you wish to discuss, so as long as you illustrate you understood those topics and provide a reasonable answer to solve the posed problem it's not too difficult. I would recommend using lots of figures, since the word limit can sometimes be tight, so flowcharts, pseudocode and illustrations in general are very helpful. Make sure to answer all rubric questions provided for each assignment.\n\n**Projects**:The class project is broken into 3 stages. The main overall class project is to develop an AI agent that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices, a standardized test of intelligence. I say main project since they also allow you the option to complete an alternate project for projects 2 and 3, which involves developing an AI agent chatbot that can answer questions based on answers from an FAQ. At each stage, you deal with progressively harder requirements / problem sets, and you will need to also write a project reflection describing your approach, what you learned and how it connects to KBAI topics. Start projects early, so you don't feel overwhelmed trying to rush things last minute. Don't neglect the written reflection too, as it's normally 40-50% of each project, and make sure to again follow the project rubric to make sure you answer all questions on each rubric.\n\n**Exams**:There are 2 take-home examinations, which aren't too difficult. They are essay-based, much like the rest of the course aside from project implementations, and you  have a week to complete each exam.\n\n**Peer Review**:You will also need to complete peer review for all assignments, all 3 project reflections, and the mid-term and final exams. They don't want single sentence sort of peer reviews, so you will have to put a bit of effort into leaving some good feedback here.\n\n**TAs**: TAs and the prof were all very active on Piazza. There were a few grading hiccups towards the end of this semester, but they were rapid in addressing these issues and correcting mistakes where necessary. I believe the prof, Dr. Goel, is stepping down and there will be a new prof so I'm not so sure if the exact structure of the course will be as described above, so take these notes with a grain of salt.\n\n**Prep**: This is a good first class, but if you aren't comfortable with Python or Java then you should get brush up on one of these prior to starting the class. Most people use Python, and if you want to complete the alternate Chatbot project, it is **only Python**.  Prepare for a lot of writing, as in total I wrote about 11-13k words across all assignments, project reflections, and exams.",

They are actually around all the time and are still experimenting with and improving the course even though this is one of the oldest courses in the program. Professor Goel is going to stop teaching this course starting next semester, but it will still be taught by Professor Joyner (and Bobbie Eicher), so you can still expect a lot of instructor involvement. The course does open book exams without proctortrack, which is personally my favorite mode of doing exams since proctortrack is so constraining. Decent amount of freedom to explore and experiment in the assignments if that's what you want to do.\n\nMy main issue (and it is a big one) is that the material itself feels pretty dated: knowledge-based AI isn't really in fashion in our age of ML and deep learning, so I took this course to see if there was still interesting techniques in that domain, and frankly I don't think I've been convinced: there is *a lot* of material in this course, but much of it seems obvious, brittle, or excessively vague. Also there seems to be a lot of repetition in the material, where techniques that are extremely similar get presented separately due to what I think are very minor differences.\n\nIn summary: this is a well-taught course. It does require you to write a lot but you don't need to be a genius to get an A, just do your work consistently. However, don't expect your mind to be blown by the material, and be aware that you are learning about an area of AI that is now fairly outdated.",

In particular, one of the projects involves deep reinforcement learning! I actually went on to reproduce some of DeepMind's recent papers on deep learning for Atari games, something which I would never have guessed I could do before this class.\n\nThe video material is quite engaging, but I found that it left some things fairly vague (for instance, I don't think it presents Q-Learning in a very clear way, though you definitely get to understand it through the assignments). Still, it covers a lot of advanced RL which is very exciting.",

Technically for the assignments you can just edit the LaTeX but for the exams you do have to scan your filled out template while being filmed by ProctorTrack... Weird.\n\nAlso be aware that there are **a lot** of exams (3 \"midterms\" and 1 final) and that the assignments and projects count for very little (5% for the assignments, 15% for the project).\n\nOne criticism however: especially at the beginning of the class, I ended up needing to do a lot of regrade requests for my assignments and first exam which I felt were graded incorrectly harshly. Out of 4 regrade requests I did, 3 got accepted, which shows that there was indeed some excessively zealous grading going on. Things got better as the class went on, but if you take this class, do check your feedback carefully and don't hesitate to request regrades if something seems way wrong.",

I was eager to experience the US B-School education and hence, mistakenly, did not apply for a waiver. Getting into the course, I had lofty expecations. However the reality was very depressing. It seems the person who put together the syllabus decided that stitching together hundreds of 20 minutes rambling by a mix of uninterested professors from Accounting, Marketing, Finance and Strategy is enough to make OMSA students fork out a thousand dollars for this course. On top of that, they will make you buy study packs to line the pockets of the professors (do not buy them, you will not miss anything). There is no rhyme or reason on why certain topics were included or emphasized (quick example: Venture Capital investments, dilutions etc.). I pity the on-campus MBA students who have to endure such torture after paying 50 grands per year. \n\nThe grading system is designed to penalize the students. All the emphasis is on 2 big ones: mid-term and end-term. If you mess up any one, you are toast. There is no project, no case study to work on and no analytic assignment. At least they should try to be honorable and stop the blatant cheating: Pls. remove the term \"for Analytics\" from \"Business Fundamentals for Analytics\".\n\nIn short, try not to take this course and apply for waiver. If you cannot, avoid taking this at the start of your association with Gatech. Else you will lose respect for US education. I only retained my sanity since I was also pursuing an interesting course from ISYE. Godspeed!  ",

The course teaches on how to visualize data, pre-process data (handle missing data), feature engineering and finally Linear and Logistic Regressions. Knowing some R libraries can really help speed up coding for the homeworks and projects. The visualization part of this course is also pretty good. They teach us about ggplots and other visualization techniques through activities (like graph networks and plotting data on world/country map) which are very powerful in creating visual charts with single line of code. I combined ML4T with this course and overall managed A in both. The 2 are a good combination.

            "text": "This was my second OMSCS course and by far one of the best courses I've taken at a university level.  I say best in term of the rich amount of material that's covered in the lectures and projects which further reinforce (THREE projects + 1 extra credit project offered but optional) the theory.  The class will require you to work very hard to complete the projects.  They give you starter code and a description of what's expected.  You will find yourself googling how to do things like setting up TCP sockets or using Shared Memory IPC etc.  A good background in C will help in this course as all the projects require using C language.  Slack and Piazza are good places to look for answers / ask when you are stuck; 7/10 times someone else has already asked the question.\n\nTo prepare for C, read and practice some examples on Arrays, Pointers (understand pointer arithmetic also), Structures, Function Pointers (used to do Callbacks), Dynamic memory allocation and freeing using malloc() and free().\n\nUbuntu operating system is used for the projects.  I used Virtual Box to run Ubuntu but perhaps my computer is sluggish and the VM was annoyingly sluggish.  I would recommend running it natively off of a partition if you can.   I have two monitors but could only use 1 with VirtualBox, I could look into enabling the 2nd monitor but I didn't even try considering how sluggish it already was.\n\nThe exams were challenging but fair.  If you go through all the lectures and understand the content and do the quiz examples and sample exam, you will be prepared for the exam.  It is a lot of content so do keep pace with the schedule while working on the projects.  I got through the class without buying the recommended books.\n\nThe course will get challenging and you might lose hope at times but keep going.  Here are sample scores from a previous semester and what grades it translated to with the curve.  I wish I had this information earlier in the semester:\n\nExample 1: Project 1 - 80 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 70%, Project 4 - 75%, Midterm - 90%, Final - 85% --> 87%, Participation - 5% (max) = A\n\nExample 2: Project 1 - 60 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 45%, Project 4 - 50%, Midterm - 80%, Final - 75%, Participation - 2% --> 65% = B\n\nProfessor Ada is passionate about this course and going above and beyond to help students.  She holds a weekly session going over project and class questions.  This was very helpful.  I did not pay much attention to this till half way through the semester.  It really does help understand the project requirements.  The TA's are also helpful in answering question in Piazza and Slack.\n\nIt was a lot of work but I'm glad I took this class.  It really makes you appreciate what the Operating System does behind the scene.  Even if you don't do Systems level programming in your career, you will have a stronger foundation in computing.  Best of luck if you take this class!",

I put it in a lot of hours into this class, trying to learn C/C++ as well as trying to succeed on the projects. Because of the extra effort, I did really well on the projects.<br>\nMy favorite projects were Project 2 (C) and Project 4 (C++). For Project 2, we had to use the libvirt API to create a CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to manage virtual machines with varying resource usage. For Project 4, we had to create an implementation of the MapReduce using gRPC - this was the biggest project in the class and was also the final one. They gave us 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to finish it, and I think I spent 3 weeks total on the project.<br>\nI found the exams to be difficult because you basically had to memorize a lot of information. This class covered several different operating systems and algorithms that were developed decades ago. Old midterms and finals were already on T-Square, so if you had to time to go through all of the old tests and skim through the research papers, then you would do fine on the tests. I definitely preferred the projects over the exams though.<br>\nThe class is curved at the end though, so as long as you start on the projects early and score really high on them, and not completely bomb the tests, you can get an A in the class.",

            "text": "This is the stalwart of the Curly/Smoov two-fer in the ML specialization. Many people are initially turned off by the open-ended nature of the class, but that's really the genius of it - to encourage intellectual exploration that would otherwise not happen if a clear and concise rubric was given to be followed.\n\nI had completed ML4T and RL previously, and those really helped with the course - particularly in understanding the grading style of the projects and with the RL parts of the course. Though having done only ML4T would have been more than sufficient in a successful experience in ML.\n\nStart on the projects on the day that they are assigned, and attending office hours, are key to succeeding in the projects. The exams are difficult and require a depth and breadth of understanding the material - there's no getting cute around that.\n\nOverall, an excellent class that is well designed and the student definitely gets as much as he puts into the class.\n",

            "text": "First things first: This was a course with an attached \"easy\" label\"; I'd say this is a course with a reasonable difficulty, **but I wouldn't categorize it as easy**. You'll need to study quite a bit and do a lot of research if you want to succeed, and most of that you'll do alone (books and resources are not provided).\n\nThe course lessons consist in video lectures from Udacity, and a textbook. They may overlap, but not necessarility.\n\nGrading is based on four take-home projects - which are just slightly related to what you see in lectures, ten open-book quizzes, and two closed-everything, one-hour proctored exams.\n\nThe projects are nice, and they'll force you to learn quite a bit on various security topics, but be aware: **most of the time you'll be on your own**. TAs will provide very limited help, and the professor is nowhere to be seen.\n\nAlso, sometimes you'll encounter badly worded, contradictory or plain wrong questions or requirements, be it in projects, exams, or quizzes: **try asking for clarifications, but don't expect proper answers**. Most of the times you'll be ignored. This is not so bad as it seems, because such questions are not a lot; but it can be frustrating if your final score is around a threshold for a grade. My suggestion is: **ignore them and go on**, you may think that spending time in \"fighting\" those will let you recover some points, but that won't work. Just go on.\n\nGeneral recommendations:\n* try achieving a 100% score in open-book quizzes. Their total value is the same as the two exams, so spend a bit of time on those, and take your time to crawl the textbook and the lessons for the proper answers.\n* start working early on projects, so you can ask on Piazza and Slack if you've got problems. **I recommend using textbooks** about the various topics, sometimes online resources are vague and make you waste time.\n* For the exams, **you must study all the lessons and the relevant chapters in the textbook**. Try understanding the underlying concept, but be advised that, without a good amount of luck, you won't get perfect scores there; some questions in the exams are overwhelmingly specific and you won't be able to answer them - but if you do well in projects and quizzes, an A is totally feasible. I wouldn't waste too much time on \"great exams\".\n\n\n",

They are essentially Prof Serban standing in front of a camera reading slides for an entire semester. Many of the questions on the quizzes/midterms/etc seemed to be open for interpretation and were debated extensively on Piazza. Many of the multiple choice & T/F questions were also very focused on technical theory (i.e \"what is the sampling distribution of the prediction of future responses under the Poisson regression model\") , which is fine for Stats majors, but for OMSA, I will not be retaining this level of detail. The examples were great and the R code provided with the examples gave a great starting point for HWs/Exams. For me, the workload was pretty light. It was essentially 1 week watching videos, 1 week HW, 1 week peer review... repeat 5x & mix in midterms/final. I averaged maybe 4 hours a week and finished with B+. Also- office hours w/ Prof Serban were @ 4 ET- they were recorded, but with only 1-2 students showing up, they were not very useful. I did learn a great deal about regression, but just did not feel engaged by this format.",

The course project was the best part of the course, but (at least my team) spent way more time on the application development than the dB design. I enjoyed this course and working on the project, but be warned- there is very little hands on database design and practical examples.. and quite a bit entity design and diagramming. ",

The TAs were very responsive (usually my Piazza posts were responded to in less than an hour, and they were also almost always available on Slack for quick queries) and most of the time they were helpful without giving the lab away. Having said that, one of the labs was slightly problematic in that you either understood it or you didn't, and there was no help that could be given (other than \"don't overthink it\") without giving it away. However, this lab is being reworked for next semester, so that should no longer be an issue.\n\nIf you come into this class without knowing C++ (pointers and STL containers), C, Java and shell scripting to some degree, you are going to have a hard time. However, if you know these already, the class is not that hard. Some of the labs are head scratchers, but once you figure out what you need, you should have no difficulty completing them.\n\nIn summary, it's an interesting course, and, if you know how to program (and if you don't why are you doing a masters in CS?) then you should have no difficulty passing.\n\nOne other thing. Although I put down six hours per week, I actually did 11 hours some weeks and 1 hour on other weeks (watching a lecture) because the labs were due every two weeks. But that distribution has more to do with me putting off the labs until a few days before they were due rather than any issue with the course.",

The exams were take-home and open-book, which allows you to use the exam as a way to learn additional material you would not have otherwise. (You'll notice other reviewers think this is a bad thing, but I think it's actually a positive that we get to learn things during the exam.) The pace of the six projects and two exams allow for no breathing.\n\nI mostly did not read the textbook and instead relied on the lectures. Many students complained the lectures were high-level, but I appreciated this since they focused on conceptual understanding. There are many online links to get more detailed information for completing assignments.\n\nI found the TA answers to questions mostly unhelpful. Everything you need to complete assignments ultimately comes up on Slack or Piazza though.\n\nI would highly recommend taking this class though I am glad I didn't pair it with another.",

The material covered is good but 95% of the learning must be done outside the class to complete the assignments. The assignment/projects are long (~15 hours/week for elite programmers, ~40 for average programmers), cover key AI topics that are often hidden behind black box python packages, and are heavily structured. This is both good and bad as the assignments act more like cookie cutter puzzles cut off of a completed project that you must fill in with your own pieces. Nothing is worse than trying to decipher someone else's code and figure out their intent. This is somewhat solved by an offline testing suite but it is often limited to the most basic things. The class definitely has the feeling of being more interested in making money than teaching students. It's a better class if you prefer independent learning and showing off your superior knowledge and skills to the professor.\n\nGrade Received: B",

Prof. Vuduc has a good sense of humor!\n2. Some parts are interesting, How do you parallelize a seemingly serial algorithm. I liked Unit 1 especially.\n3. Initial labs were really interesting. (Basically lab1 & lab2, lab3 was okay).\n4. Generous marking.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. It's a time sink. The lectures only give you really basic intro - with hundreds of external references, which you may have to read to actually understand the material.\n2. Not much interaction with Prof. Vuduc. The course was mostly driven by TAs.\n3. More theory oriented than needs to be & heavily tilted towards MPI scheme of things (which is really niche).\n4. No mention of CUDA & related stuff. Not even basic NUMA which are becoming commonplace. So this course has limited practical utility.\n\nMisc:\n1. The last 2 labs were about Terasort & Funnelsort. Really ? I came to this course for learning parallel algorithms, not yet another sorting algorithm.\nAnd don't get me started on Deepthought :-(\n2. OpenMPI is really niche, and unless you work in an area that uses it, no point banging your head for it.\n3. Finally, I came to this course reading all the good reviews, but IMHO this course is highly overrated. \nYou should look up the actual course material on udacity to decide on whether you want to take this.",

            "text": "This was my first OMSCS course. I come from a mechanical engineering background, with only done 1 C project over a year ago during my senior year embedded computing class and capstone project. I've done some self-studying and programming at work, so not completely disconnected from the programming world. \n\nI knew that I would struggle a bit to understand and relearn C so I gave myself extra time to do the projects (START EARLY) and stay consistent with a strict schedule. With a full time job and no kids, this class was my life for these few months.\n\nOne key thing I struggled with in the beginning was to set up your environment. They say there are a bunch of ways to do it and you can do it however you would like, but from a beginner's perspective and not knowing anything about how to set up an environment, I would have appreciated it if they had ONE default suggestion. After a week or two of struggling to get a proper environment set up, I finally found a working environment. I used VM VirtualBox to install Ubuntu (which they should have instructions/find instructions on internet), then for IDE in Ubuntu I used VisualStudio Code. This IDE was great because I figured out how to do debugging (there is a youtube video on debugging with VSC in Ubuntu), and you can debug with multiple VSC windows, essentially stepping through multiple interacting programs (debugging client AND server at the same time).\n\nA tip is to be active on the Slack channel. It can be difficult to keep up with all the activity going on, but if you put in the time and effort, you can sometimes gain some really helpful pointers and tips. That is why it is recommended to really start early and find your problems/roadblocks early, and you can be on the lookout for a solution in the Slack channel. To get the most out of the Slack channel, I learned that you need to be very precise with the wording of your questions and try your best to communicate that through text. That will allow the TA's or students to better help  answer your questions. Don't be afraid to ask your questions, but be specific and think about how to phrase it in a way for other people to understand (explaining code and technical stuff through text can be very confusing and difficult).\n\nAnother tip is try to meet up with students locally. Having someone to talk to and discuss project ideas and course concepts is VERY helpful. Of course please beware of plagiarism and misconduct according to the course rules.\n\nProjects were absolutely great! Coming from someone with very little C programming experience, I had so much to gain. Of course they might change the project contents every semester, but our semester it was fair amount of work with the given time. The first project was the most daunting because everything was so foreign to me. The VM, which IDE to use, how to debug, socket programming (concepts I've never done nor was it taught in the videos); it was overwhelming at first... so START EARLY. Project 3 was by far the most fun (get a whiteboard) with the design aspect. Project 4 was the most difficult to wrap your head around, but once you figure it out, you will say: \"What that's it?...\"\n\nIf you finish the projects and pass all the automated tests with a decent readme, you should be able to get 100 on the projects. I did right at average for the midterm, and a little below average on the final (disappointed with my performance), but I surprisingly got an A in the course!\n\nAll in all, in my opinion this was a perfect first OMSCS course. It will definitely not be easy, but if you put the time and hard work in, you shall be rewarded!",

            "text": "*TLDR*: This is a graduate program, you are expected to work hard and work beyond what is provided to you. This course is an intro to ML/Data Science. Don't take it if you took ML already. \n\nThis was my first class at GT. I paired it along with KBAI. Although it's recommended to not take more than one class at a time, it wasn't my first time taking online classes, so I knew how to deal with the self-discipline of handling an online class. That being said:\n\nThe class wasn't difficult, but it was challenging. The first half of the course is a breeze (assuming you have programming experience and know basic statistics/visualizations). The second half of the course was more challenging, but it's where you learn. We implemented Logistic Regression from scratch, had to derive the cost function (partial derivative), and analyzed datasets, etc. The course serves more as an intro to Data Science as it covers visualizing data, cleaning data, modeling data, and deriving conclusions from data, overall making you think like a Data Scientist. I don't have a formal ML background (although I work in a Data Analytics team, so I'm exposed to it), so a lot of this material was not new for me. I do believe this is a good intro to ML/Data Science. \n\nOn another note, you will have to do independent studying to handle the 2nd half of the course. Prof Lebanon is quite dry and personally it was very difficult to pay attention to his lectures. Also, I didn't enjoy his teaching style. I made good use of Andrew Ng's ML course in order to understand some of the topics discussed in the second half.\n\nHaving completed only one of the extra credit tasks (called Activities), I ended up with an A. Professor Joyner taking over is probably the best thing that could've happened to this class. \n\nOne annoying part of this class however was how unprepared some students seemed to have been for a graduate program of this caliber (this is one of the easier courses of the program). Piazza was almost unbearable with the amount of simplistic questions that could have either been figured out independently or by a simple google search. I understand lots of people don't come from a CS/Software Engineering background, but the amount of hand holding some people needed/expected was almost ridiculous.",

            "text": "I took KBAI as my first course in OMSCS and was very impressed with the organization and quality of the course. The interaction with TAs, Professor and fellow students on Piazza was one of the highlights. Much of the course centers around 3 projects that implement an AI agent to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. This semester there was an alternate project offered for projects 2 and 3 for a select number of students that implemented a chatbot. In hindsight I wish I had taken the opportunity. I believe the chatbot project will be offered to more students in future semesters. My only gripe is that we didn't have more project based work that allowed us to implement techniques learned later in the course. The Raven's projects really only implemented techniques learned in the first few weeks. Be prepared for a lot of writing. Also, you can put as much time as you want into this course so it is a little dangerous. The homeworks and projects are very open ended.",

            "text": "Overall this was a decent course.  The lectures were pretty weak in my opinion, some weeks it was just a TA giving you the answers to the homework.  The homework assignments were pretty solid and the format of using Jupyter notebooks was really nice.  \n\nThe worst part of the course were the exams.  They were quite lengthy and exhausting.  It felt like the homework didn't prepare you at all for the exam so there was a lot of trying to research and learn stuff during the exam which adds to the amount of time needed to complete it.  That said, the final was relatively easy compared to the midterms so that was nice.  One thing that I didn't figure out until the final that might have been helpful for the midterms: instead of spending an entire work day (8 hours) on the exam, work 4 hours one night, then go to sleep, work 4 hours the next day.  The only down side to this is that if you need all 24 hours to complete the exam, you waste some up front (note, the longest I spent on an exam was only 13 hours or so). ",

A lot of the information about marketing and strategy is very helpful for understanding why the company I work for makes certain decisions.\n\nThe homework assignments seemed fairly easy and the most difficult exam questions would be very similar.

            "text": "**My background**  \nHave used C language for numerical analysis for years  \nDon't have any degree related to computer science  \nTook this class for the first course\n\n**Review**  \nThis class uses C to program server-client file transfer concepts. There are 3 projects, beginning from simple *echo*ing server to a server that does some sophisticated jobs like receives a file from a client, do requested work, and send back the result to the client where both server and client are multithreaded. If you are not familiar with these programming concepts, it will take time to understand and do the first project even if you have used C for different applications.\n\nAs this class declares itself as *intro*, the lecture covers pretty wide range of topics. Watching 1 Udacity lecture video took me about 3 to 4 hours. There are 4 to 6 lectures per part and there are total 4 parts, you can calculate how much time you have to pay for watching Udacity videos. I recommend you to keep notes for every video otherwise you will not find relevant materials when preparing for the exams. I kept notes with MS Word and I spent about 4 pages per lecture.\n\nThe workload I specified (==10hr/week) is the peak load when there is a project. I spent average 2 hours a day for a whole week to complete the project before the due date. If you are smart and can find an easy way to implement the problem, then it should be shorter. If you are going in the wrong direction, you will spend the whole week for debugging. When there is no project due, I recommend spending some time to follow the Udacity videos. It is quite long.\n\nThe instructor gracefully provides an expected question set for each exam. It is a shared google doc and students are encouraged to collaboratively fill the form. You can see other students' answers so you will find it very useful. There are two exams, midterm and final. And the final is **not** cumulative.\n\nThe instructor also encourages you to read provided literature. She actually covers what the provided literature is doing, and it will be also on the exams. But those technical papers are hard to read and also not very fun to read, honestly.",
