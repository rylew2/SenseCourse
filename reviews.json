    "CS-6035": " This was a much better course than I initially expected.  The 4 projects were challenging but educational and doable.  The video lectures and book readings were also good.  This course makes me want to take other OMSCS security courses now. Overall, this course was good, but not great. The 4 projects are where 90% of the learning occurs. The quizzes are easy but the 2 exams are nonsense. The questions were randomly pulled for the textbook and poorly worded. The TAs were very responsive and with some minor changes, the class could be great. This was my first dropped class. I found the content exceeding interesting, but the class is just poorly designed. I only went through two projects but the majority of my time spent was on set up and debugging the VMs provided. The second project literally wouldn't work as it was assigned, and required amendment via fellow students in T-Square to work. So that was a day+ lost. If something didn't work the recommendation was to rebuild the VM. Which even on my brand new MPB is a 20 minute process. \n\nI followed past my drop and apparently project 3 is even worse, with multiple amendments to non-functional aspects of the setup. I don't regret dropping it. \n\nEveryone involved is trying very hard but it's just not ready for prime time and doesn't really compare well to the rest of the OMSCS program. I want to spend the majority of my time learning, not fixing setup/instruction issues. I imagine that's true of most students in the program.  I took the summer version of this class so it didn't have the extra credit options. \n\nSKILLS NEEDED: some C and assembler required for first project. For last project, its important you understand HTML, HTML forms and some PHP. Not having that general understanding seemed to be a barrier for some taking the class. \n\nThis class gives you a good broad overview of Information Security. It doesn't go too deeply into things. But the assignments are very well designed. The first one was challenging for me (even though I have lots of C and some Assembly experience). \n\nThe lectures cover a LOT and there's a lot of reading as well. So it was a bit challenging to just keep up with it in a busy schedule (esp. after having taken several lecture-light courses). The quizzes do a good job of keeping you on track in the schedule and on getting a summary of what is learned. \n\nThe TAs and professor have plenty of office hours but its mostly drop in or by arrangement. So I didn't really take advantage of this. \n\nIn terms of teaching I give this class full marks. \n\nMy only complaint is having to deal with strange wording issues in the Quizzes and Exams (as others have pointed out here). Generally such things don't bother me, but in this case it was more trying to figure out how the grader will respond than what the correct answer was. That needs improvement. An entry-level class with interesting assignments. A very well balanced and informative course. I took it over a summer that made it a bit more time consuming and difficult, but overall the pedagogy was very good. Most of the readings are from one book and the assignments were interesting to solve rather than tedious This class had a lot of reading and covered a vast amount of material. Unfortunately for me, my reading comp is not what it used to be!!\n\nThe projects were great at demonstrating the subject material. However, from a non-CS background, they were INCREDIBLY (for me) time consuming, and occasionally frustrating. However, writing exploits (buffer overflows) and doing cross-site request forgeries, cross site scripting, sql injections - how cool! I havent written a line of C code in 25+ years, so learning some C and learning to use a C debugger would be helpful. I recommend starting early on the projects. Appreciated the optional extra-credit project. However, I didnt have time available during the semester (with the workload of 6300 and my job) to dedicate time to them. So, at the last minute I submitted half of the optional project 2. 5, and believe I got a few extra points to help the class average. \n\nDO follow the assignment instructions. I lost 10 points on the first assignment for placing an exploit file within my writeup, and the instructions said to attach it separately. My bad!\n\nI learned a tremendous amount in this course. Although there was minimal if any interaction with the instructor, the TAs were more than involved, had access to him (and in one instance interceded on my behalf), were highly knowledgeable and available daily. And, until the last project I didnt realize they had chat rooms during their office hours where we could get help when needed. \n\nI do have another security text I purchased a few years ago. I found the Stallings text to be an awesome asset to one's library. The book was great, and I feel was a key to the tests and quizzes. The second half of the class, given my overall daily workload, I was not able to keep up with the reading, and am cramming for the final. \n\n\nTo me, this should be a required course for anyone in CS. I look forward to taking the network security class. Seems like peoples concerns were heard. Spring 2016 syllabus has (20) 1% quizzes, (4) 15% projects, (2) 10% exams, and (1) optional 10% project for a grade boost. First project took a bit of time to learn about how to use gdb and machine code in general. Preparing for midterm now, which coveres 10 chapters. \nThe second project was a bit annoying to get the VM set up. I was sure I ran the malware analysis correctly, but don't think the results were coming out correctly. I got a new laptop after this project to ensure that I would not have any technical issues for the remainder of my OMSCS life. Project 4 and optional project 4. 5 were easy because I am familiar with JS and SQL. Project 3 was buggy, and the instructor recognized that stating that he will address that in future courses. \nI missed a bunch of quizzes because of poor time management, but still ended up with an A in the course. Overall the class touches upon many interesting topics and is a good second course to take with something more intense, such as ML.  I really enjoyed this course. Lectures were well designed and we were given enough guidance on the projects in order to complete them successfully. Exams were relatively straightforward. Given that I did well on the projects, I hardly needed to even complete the final exam which was nice. Given the option of prioritizing projects was really nice since I'm not the greatest test taker. The class was very interesting and covered most of the current security concerns that should be in any developers mind as they write code.  The front half of the class and project 1 had a higher time commitment (12 hours / week) for me compared to the second half (4-6 hours / week). The videos are good, but not the best ones I've seen in the OMS CS program.  The videos didn't always illustrate complex things such as DES, AES, RSA, and TLS hand-shake clearly, but supplementing with other sources and the book cleared that up.  I used the international edition of the book which is less expensive, but sacrifices the on-line material and some additional chapters which would have been helpful in a couple cases.  The first assignment in C was more challenging for me, but the other assignments were fairly easy and straight forward.  We used C, Python, and JavaScript, but you don't have to have a significant amount of programming experience in those; you can Google your way through most of it.  The hardest part of the class is retaining all of the facts about all the different aspects of Info Sec for the tests. Great class! The work load is somewhat light but the projects were extremely interesting and enlightening. It definitely opened my eyes to many security vulnerabilities I had not previously considered. I took it over the summer and thought it was a good fit for short summer term. I found the subject matter interesting even though I had no prior interest in security. Projects are not very challenging but rather tricky as most projects involve exploiting some security vulnerability. This is an intro course. Very intro. If you ever had any security experience in the past, this will be review. I was a bit surprised that is offered at this level for a graduate program. The lectures and textbook material is basically a vocabulary exercise. The projects are what make the class interesting. It was a bit more work than average this semester since it was the first time this class had been offered for the summer. Since the semester is shorter, there is a bit more work to be done per week. Very doable. Since this was the first summer semester for this course, the TAs and Professor did their best to try and make it better for the students. Although, sometimes the decisions seemed to be knee-jerk and ended up making things harder rather than easier.  Over all this was a interesting and worthwhile class. The projects are really interesting and I learned a lot from them. The quizzes are kind of a waste of time; they feel like busywork. The tests were not exactly hard, but the questions were oddly worded with a lot of distracting errors which made them very tricky.\n\nThe projects are the biggest part of your grade, which is a good thing. They cover a wide range of topics and require a lot of different skills. They were challenging but doable.\n\nThe class was hard because it's so wide ranging; you will almost definitely have to work with something you are totally unfamiliar with at some point. You will have to put in some time doing research outside of the class materials to learn the tool you are working with. The best part of this course is the projects. They are a lot of fun to do and gave a lot of details about concepts that I have heard about a lot for years. None of them were very time consuming- they were all easily accomplished on a Saturday (5-10 hours for each project). The lectures are also well done and informative. The assignments got a bit tedious- 20 assignments in the semester administered as quizzes on T-square, so more than 1 per week. They don't take very long to do, but I didn't feel like I learned much from any of them nor did they test my knowledge very well. They were simple true/false, multiple choice, and fill in the blank questions that basically just took a random sentence from the textbook or lecture and made it into a question. There were a few instances of the \"correct\" answer conflicting with other sources, or differences between the book and the lecture. The midterm was structured the same as these assignments, so it was just your ability to spit out random tidbits (mostly from the book). \n\nAll in all its a good course.  I had an overall positive experience with this course. \n\nThere are 4 projects, 2 optional projects, 10 quizzes, 2 exams, a book to read, and a bunnnnch of lectures (that also have quizzes). \n\nThe thing I disliked the most about this course is the busy work that comes with it. The projects were great and I watched all the lectures. But the quizzes, the exams, and the reading just did not help me learn at all. The hard part about the exams is that you really don't know where questions are coming from... quizzes? book? lectures? projects? all of the above? So that makes studying harder. \n\nWhat I liked about the course were the projects. They really helped me understand the material we were learning and I felt like I was able to really grasp some of the fundamental aspects of software security that I was missing from my undergrad. Since I had a computer science background these projects weren't too difficult. You'll need to know: C, Python, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. \n\nThe only other comment I have is that the TAs/Instructor didn't participate in Piazza as much as I would have liked. It made the whole semester feel disorganized. For example, the instructors didn't post anything about the first exam until 2-3 days before it opened. Makes studying pretty hard. They also didn't post anything about the final. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and learned a lot from it! <b>EDIT 2:</b> Project 4 grade received on May 4 in the late morning and apparently I was not suspected of cheating.  A simple update on Piazza could have saved me, and probably many others, a lot of stress.  I still stand by everything else I said below in the original review and edit 1.\n\n<b>EDIT 1:</b> As of May 4, I have to downgrade my review from \"liked\" to \"neutral\" due to some stressful communication issues.  We were told on May 1 that all project 4 grades were expected to be returned later that night.  Also on the night of May 1, we were told that the instruction team found out some students used past projects on GitHub to complete project 4.  After this, the instruction team basically fell silent with very little exception.  Like many others, I don't have my project 4 grade yet.  I didn't cheat on project 4 or at all in this course, so the fact that I have neither my grade nor even the smallest relevant update from the instruction team is getting very frustrating and making me anxious, especially since it's now been 2.5 days since we heard anything relevant.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this.  My mind is racing at the thought of all the ridiculous hoops I'll probably need to jump through to fight a wrongful cheating accusation, and it's causing a lot of unnecessary stress.  Take this course with caution.\n\n<b>Original review:</b><br/>\nThis was a great course and was not too demanding. There are 10 open-book quizzes, each worth 2% of the grade. Almost every question is verbatim from the textbook or lecture notes. There are two closed-book exams worth 10% each. They were on par with the quizzes in difficulty, maybe a little more so since notes weren't allowed and they covered more material. The final exam was not cumulative. There were four projects, each worth 15%. The projects were some of the most interesting and fun I've ever done in CS, as an undergrad or grad student. We had about a month to do each project, which is <b>way</b> more than necessary. For that reason, IIS is a fantastic course to pair with another course.\n\nProject 1 is all about buffer overflows. Knowing C helps a bit but is by no means a necessity. It's probably more important to know about internal memory architecture at a somewhat high level. This project was definitely the most time consuming for me, and I think I can objectively say it's the one with the most amount of work. (P4 might be more work if you have literally no web dev experience.)\n\nProject 2 is about malware analysis. I'm not that interested in malware but I still enjoyed working on this project. It was a massive decrease in difficulty and workload from project 1 also. No programming required for this project; it's all with a tool in a provided VM.\n\nProject 3 is about cryptography. This one was awesome. Some basic cryptographic algorithm programming in Python. Previous knowledge of Python will absolutely be helpful, and even if you don't there is plenty of time to learn it before the deadline. A ton of guidance is given and a lot of the code is already provided.\n\nProject 4 is about web security and exploiting XSRF and XSS vulnerabilities, and doing an SQL injection. This one was extremely easy if you have previous HTML and JavaScript experience. There is some PHP code in the files we're provided, so it helps to know that a bit. But if you have previous programming experience then understanding the PHP code will not be an issue. Also, the only code we actually had to write ourselves for this is HTML and JavaScript.\n\nReally cool stuff. The textbook is dry AF and probably the worst part of the course. The lectures were so-so but informative. Mostly absentee professor on Piazza, but seriously, who cares? We learn material from the professors' lecture videos, not from their Piazza posts.\n\nI definitely recommend taking this class. If you're lucky, your Piazza forum will be filled, like it was this semester, with highly entertaining posts from people constantly whining about the dumbest things, largely because they can't read/follow instructions or they need some serious hand-holding and spoon-feeding.\n Really enjoyed the course.  I liked the course material but the TA's were largely disorganized. The questions for the quizzes are usually directly lifted sentences in the textbook with missing words. Makes them overly easy with a digital copy of the textbook. The projects were fun but grades were very slow to return and some of the submital instructions often unclear and contradictory to best practices. I have little good to say about this class, other than that it isn't quite as pointless as Computer Networks. It's somewhat more difficult, but that's not saying much. \n\nGrading consists of two rote memorization exams (easy), a lot of open book quizzes (which themselves appear to be plagiarized from Quizlet, so you know.. google them), and some projects (moderate difficulty). \n\nThe lectures are okay, if boring. I really can't complain about them. \n\nThe projects are really only a challenge whenever the questions are ambiguous, nonsense, or rewritten by the TAs after release (formally or informally on Piazza via \"clarifications\"). \n\nTAs are not very responsive on the forums, from what I've seen. \n\nThis course does not meet my expectations for this program. It's certainly not on the same level as the CV, RLDM, ML, or CCA, etc. On the other hand, if you find yourself out of interesting courses to take and want to just finish the program, here's an easy A.  This course was much too easy. The projects were mildly interesting but each of them could be completed in a few hours. The exams were rote memorization based from the book. This is one of the easiest courses I've ever taken, not just in the OMSCS program. The TAs were involved but the professor didn't write/respond to a single piazza post. This is a good course to pair with a difficult one (or if you're thinking of taking 3 in a semester) and want an easy A. Course material is really interesting. Quizzes are straight from the book. Assignments are interesting too. The only drawback is the midterm and final exams. You need to read whole book to score good marks. However, Professor did mention they may remove the exams and have more assignments instead I really enjoyed this course. The projects are fun and are more challenging than the tests or quizzes. This should go without saying but start the projects early. Use an electronic version of the book, which will help you study and take quizzes more efficiently. You'll need some basic proficiency in one of (python, c/c++, java) and some basic web development experience. So if you have never built a webpage and used a bit of javascript, you should look into that some. Please don't ignore Piazza no matter how smart you are. The TAs will clarify inconsistencies between the required text and the Udacity lectures and will remove confusion about quiz questions and assignments. You'll probably kick yourself if you miss questions and parts of assignments just because you missed a good Piazza post.  Interesting concepts on security. Interchanging instructors between 1st 1/2 and the 2nd 1/2 of the course felt more of a detour, but none the less the projects were fun to work on. The only thing to add, start working on projects early as project 1 and 3 are very time consuming. Pretty great class! Projects are awesome great way to learn about security. I'd recommend leaving time to read the chapters, the lecture doesn't really cover a lot of the topics that will be on the exam. I'd recommend that you do one of the extra credits. As mentioned in some earlier comments, It's an intro course. That's why it says \"Intro\" in the name. But if you've got little to no info sec experience this is a fun way to get some. The readings were a bit long, but there was a lot of material surveyed and they were well worth it. The lectures were very approachable, but there wasn't much depth in most of them. They were typically a bit of a review of the readings rather than instruction of the material. But that may be an artifact of my habit of reading first, then watching the lectures. The projects though... These were the most fun of any projects I've had in the program so far and I learned a ton doing them. You will feel like a l33t H@x0r at least once in this class. You know. If you're into that kind of thing... Easy class with very interesting projects. Each project was very unique and needed different languages.  The course was a good overview of security. Learned a good bit about software security, buffer overflows, network security and encryption. I thought the tests were just memorization, and the questions could have been a little more clear. That being said, they weren't overly difficult. The projects were great and if you complete the projects, you'll have a good grasp of the topics. I have a tendency to overdo the work and projects in courses - i feel it's probably possible to spend less time.  Good intro to security for those who have interest. I thought I would be one of those but this class made it clear to me that I actually don't! Back to the actual meat of the class though, I believe the projects is a good attempt to apply the topics learnt. The book can get very dry and lengthy. Without the readings,the workload for the class would be much less. The TAs are great in this class but I didn't hear much from Prof. Wenke Lee at all. There were just a couple of posts from him throughout the entire semester. Great class. I would definitely recommend taking it with another class, especially if you have a hard class you need to take because the class is not difficult. \nThe first half of the semester is basically common sense stuff, really if you know little about security, you know enough for the first half. The second half of the class, which I consider to start with cryptography, is a little more challenging, but it is not difficult to grasp the concepts. \n\nMy favorite part was the projects - 4 projects + 4 optional, of the optional you only can do 1. \nProject 1 - Easy, work with C and gdb\nProject 2 - Easy, triggering malware\nProject 3 - Easy, basically doing a test for an app that one of the TA's built - Very bad project in my opinion because I didn't learn anything and really did not get anything out of it. \nProject 4 - Easy, you \"hack\" a fake website. \nNot as easy as the other 3, but if you know JS and HTML you will be fine. It took me a bit more time than the others simply because I was confused as to what I was doing. \n\nMidterm was not difficult, all true/false and multiple choice questions. You can only answer them one at a time, so that was annoying because you could not go back and double check. The questions were similar to the Quizzes, but some of the questions did get me. \n\nI should mention this is my first class in the program and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new and thinking about taking it.  This class covered some basic topics around Information Security. There was a lot of reading to do but it was worth it to go in-depth into some topics. the projects were really interesting and taught me a lot. \n\nThe TAs are active on Piazza and Slack and help out a lot. \n\nIt was a little hard to keep up in the shortened summer semester, but it was definitely manageable. This class was not too tough. The projects are fun (especially project 1). Project 2 was a bit dodgy, but the rest are alright. These are the projects that if you do it right, you know. The exam was multiple choice. The textbook is quite... boring. One wonders, this is the stuffs of Swordfish, Mr. Robot, and other hackers type movie. How did the text book writer managed to make it sound so boring? -. - The material: This course covers a LOT of ground. In the summer term, we read almost the entire book, and there were just under 18 hours of lectures. That being said, the material is broad and not very deep. This is definitely a survey course. \n\nGrading: For this term, 20% of the final grade comes from ten quizzes (open book/open note), 60% from four projects (equally weighted), and 20% from two exams (equally weighted). The exams are a midterm and final, and the final is not cumulative. \n\nThe projects: These took me from 6 to 12 hours each. The projects were:\n1. Execute a buffer overflow attack - make sure you're up on your C programming and have an intimate knowledge of how the OS lays programs out in memory. \n2. Malware analysis - we used a virtual machine to safely study malware. This project is basically following the instructions with no independent thought. \n3. Cryptography - implement cipher block chaining, and search a keyspace to try to crack ciphertext. Your choice of Python or Java for the assignment. \n4. Web security - launch a XSS, XSRF, and SQL injection attack against pre-supplied PHP code. \n\nAs you can see, these projects target different skillsets. You may have an easy time with one over the other. \n\nThe exams: There is very little required in the way of synthesis with the material, but there is a LOT of material to learn. The class average for the first exam was an 80. I'm writing this before getting the results of the final exam. \n\nBonus project: the professors graciously allowed us a 10% extra credit project. Do it - it's fire insurance against a bad exam performance and can almost guarantee you the A. \n\nFinal verdict: this class was fun, and I learned a lot. When you solve the projects, it feels like magic (OMG - I just launched a buffer overflow attack!). I'd recommend this course.  Poor TA support during the semester I took the class, including one encryption assignment where the reference data file was just plain wrong. Perhaps to be expected in an intro/survey course, but frequent changes of tech stack were a bit maddening. Almost every assignment required a different programming language.  My first class in OMSCS and I really enjoyed it. Reading reviews of other classes vs. this class I'm really happy it was my first. It's rather general but with no security knowledge coming in that was fine by mean. The lectures are easy to watch and you do get the general ideas you need from them. The book is SUPER dry but needed. Not necessarily to read all the way through but to skim for sure. Certain sections won't be touched in the videos. Lots of googling and piazza will help you through the projects. They're not hard you just don't always have the specifics you need to complete them. Shout out to TA Scott for helping me through two of them when there was a bug in the VM / wasn't given enough info to start with. Quizzes are crazy easy but the exam are definitely harder. Not sure hard but not as easy as everything else. You can't always anticipate the questions and they can be really vague. You should be able to fine in the class regardless of the exams, though. Glad I took - think every dev should have at least a basic knowledge of security.  Most of the projects were not as challenging as the other courses I've taken, but they were far more interesting and really helped us engage with the material. Overall, this class was the most fun of any I've taken so far and was the most rewarding. I feel like I took a lot away from this class, even though it was a fairly light time commitment.  There ere weekly quizzes, and a lot of lectures & text book to cover each week, but manageable. The 4 projects were challenging if you didn't know C, HTML, or whatever language, but were also fun. The TAs were great in helping sutdents, and also from students helping students on Piazza. I used to IT consider really dry (let's be honest, it can be) but after this class I have new appreciation for it. I have no regrets taking this class. The Instructors did a great job designing it. This class is little more than a GPA booster. The projects aren't too bad but cover the majority of your grades. If you read a few resources on the Internet (or wait until the last week so the project errata is ironed out and the relevant questions are answered in Piazza) you'll breeze through the projects. I spent 5-10 on each project. This is one of the easier courses in the program similar to CN. There is a lot of theory with most of them being common sense material. There is a book to read which is very dry but the quiz questions come from the book. Most of the time was spent on reading the book. I don't think the mid-term questions came from the book - they were mostly from the lectures. The projects are quite unique and interesting, but not too hard. You have the option of doing only 2 out of 4 projects. Workload is average but for the week leading up to the exams, you will have to set aside lot more time.  This course is easy for those who can read a lot, be focussed on long lectures. Assignments in form of quizzes appear every week. Projects have a gap of 3 weeks. Its doable but I did find Project 1 hard. Exams are based on whats covered in the book, lectures, slides. Feed that into your brain you can do really well. You need lots of time to read and go through the material. There is no brain-cracking stuff here. Its actually very simple. I enjoyed the content because it was really very interesting and worth knowing. I did enjoy the course, but as a first cohort student into this class, there were start-off glitches. But by now Prof. Lee and his awesome TAs have got the hang of it. Hopefully the future students will sail smooth.  NOTE - This was written a few weeks after the midterm. \n\nQuizzes are on average about 10 questions per section. The quiz questions are all either true/false, multiple guess, or fill-in-the-blank and mostly just test your ability to use Google and CTRL+F. The book material is a struggle to read through, the lectures are a bit more interesting, and the first half of the course gives you a lot of material to study for the midterm. The projects are great, but the first one can be frustrating if you're unfamiliar with C and assembly. The second project was cool - we used Cuckoo to analyze the behaviors of cryptolocker malware, keyloggers, and other trojans. \n\nThe midterm itself was kind of a let-down. The class average was in the mid-70's and the content was seemingly just testing your ability to regurgitate random phrases about concepts from the book and lectures, not how well you applied the content.  This course covers some very interesting topics, but the execution needs work. Multiple projects were plagued with technical difficulties which, in some cases, kept students from being able to complete them. Others go fairly far beyond the material covered in class. This would be fine for more open-ended project requirements (we should all expect to do some solo research and problem-solving in a masters degree program), but it seemed that many students relied heavily upon the expertise of a few industry professionals amongst the student body to guide them through. Exams are somewhat boring and quizzes are word-for-word copies of book sentences. Again, not a terrible class, but not as well done as others I've taken in OMSCS. Definitely a class you can pair with another, though set aside lots of extra time if you want to get more out of it than just a good grade.  The projects were challenging but we were required to complete 2 out of 4 of them. There was a good amount of material, both in textbook and in the lectures. I learned quite a bit in this course.  This is my 2nd class in the program and I really enjoyed it overall. Although I took it in a full semester, I think this would be better as a summer course because there were about 4 \"down\" weeks in the course where I didn't do anything. \n\nThe projects span a wide range of topics, but are very manageable. I thought the 1st project, Buffer Overflow was the hardest if you don't have background in C and memory architecture. The 2nd, Malware Analysis, was very straightforward. The Cryptography project was also fairly easy since you don't have to write your own mathematical algorithms unless you really want to. (So you can make it more challenging if you desire by not using libraries.) Finally, 4th Web Security project definitely seemed very hard for those who had never done any web development. If you have encountered JS/HTML/PHP, it is fine. \n\nThe Canvas quizzes are worth 20% of your grade and open book. So basically, 20% of your grade should be 100% right off the bat. The exams were a bit more random/tricky with some material included that is barely even covered in 2 sentences in the book. I read most of the book, but overall I probably won't retain much since the book is dry and topics are quickly covered. I somewhat regret spending time reading since I don't feel I walked away from the reading with a really deep understanding, but rather with a surface level acquaintance with terminology to pass an exam. I'm sure I will forget all the specialized terminology within a few weeks, hopefully the general concepts stick though. \n\nOverall, it was a fun course.   A very good core course and relevant. Plenty of decent reading for students and you are free to make it as difficult and thorough as you would like to. It can however be very challenging though for those new to the subject matter. Not too difficult. Projects were interesting for the most part - especially the RSA crypto one. The \"analyzing malware\" project was miserable, impossible to know if you were doing it right. I ended up mostly guessing on that one, and made up for it on the other assignments. The exams were very short and all multiple choice/true-false, easy to do well. \n\nReadings were pretty verbose and a bit dry. The easiest class. I spent a total of six afternoons in the entire semester to deal with 4 projects and 2 exams. And in the end, I overdid it because the curving is generous. Forget about the book, slides and Udacity. Wikipedia is good enough. Overall the course is great! The projects in this class were the highlight for me. The lectures weren't that great but they do cover the material well. Overall I enjoyed this class very much. This course covers a lot of topics and I love the projects. Work load is definitely not high, but those projects are not trivial.  Very easy class. You can get many points from online quiz (open book and you can try as many times as you want) and projects. Projects are mostly straight forward expect for the stack buffer overflow assignment on Project 1. Project 3 and 4 are also fun (I like programming assignments). Tests can be tricky and sentences in questions I felt bit ambiguous. But if you do well in quizes and projects, you should be fine as long as you can secure 60% or so in these exams.\n\nThe lectures and a book are super dry and even you can skip totally if you want to focus on grading. I have a neutral impression on this class. Cakewalk compared to many of the other courses in the program. The projects are the meat of the course but also where you learn the most, by far. Hit them immediately once they are released and you'll finish them in a couple of days for the most part, but you might get stuck on a few parts and need additional days to do extra research. Don't wait on the projects until the last few days.\n\nYou'll find some people in this class whining and complaining. Here's a rough piece of advice...if you can't handle this course, leave the program.  I'm enjoying this class. It's pretty interesting. The homeworks are basically a measure of whether you read the text or not as the answers can typically be found verbatim. The first project was a buffer overflow project which took a bit of time but wasn't bad. The second project was running and analysing some malware. It was simple. The midterm was what you would expect from an 'intro' class. Overall an ideal class for someone that is busy with work and family.  Review also done mid-semester. The projects are fun and not too difficult. First project required writing a ~10 line C program and reading a ~10 line C program and exploiting it. Dont worry if you dont have any C knowedge, the C code isnt doing anything complex. Second project is simply running a program and interpreting its results, easily finished in a weekend. I didnt start on the third project (cryptology) yet but you can choose between C++, Java or Python. There is required reading and the weekly quizes and the midterm/final is based on the textbook. I never did any of the readings and got an A on every quiz and the midterm. I found most of the material to be common sense. Lectures are informative. Decent class, not my favorite so far but worth taking if you are interested in security. Probably one of the easiest classes I have taken so far (this is my 6th one).  This review done mid-semester. The projects in this class are the high points. They're pretty great. The lectures are decent, and the book is fall asleep boring. The quizzes are based on the book. That said, the information is very useful, the professor and TAs are great. You'll want to be sure you can setup a VM. A light bit of C is required in the first project. Linux knowledge is, as usual, helpful. Haven't tackled the crypto section yet, so keep that in mind when reading this review.  Okay. If you have Security+ or similar backround, you have 90% of the material. A bit boring - a fair bit of reading, but not too hard. Easy class and interesting material. This is an interesting class with some pretty fun projects. \n\nYou are graded on 10 open note quizzes, 4 projects, 1 optional project, and 2 closed book exams. \n\nMost people I think get by with these quizzes pretty easily since you can find the answers on the internet or search for them through the textbook. Regardless of how you approach the quizzes, I would highly suggest reading the textbook for the exams. While the Udacity videos are very interesting, they do not provide enough of a background for you to be able to do well on the exams and it is likely the intention of the instructor that you really take the time to go over the material in the textbook. \n\nThe projects are pretty engaging and require a mixed bag of skills. Even if you're not familiar with the language (like C for the first project) the instructors give you ample time to complete each of the 4 projects. Additionally you have the option to do an extra project to boost your average if you did poorly on one of the other ones. I have an engineering (not CS) background and got an A in this class. That said, I was quite disappointed with the class. I was surprised how poorly and lazily administered the class was. Regularly the students had to remind the instructors to open the quizzes or post projects based on the schedule. The textbook is a must only because the quiz questions are verbatim from the book. The exams, which are a major part of the grade, had very little quality control and were very unbalanced (neglecting several topics but focusing too many questions on a single topic). The only redeeming part is the projects, which are pretty interesting. But for a CS newbie, it required more time than it should have. Also, be prepared to think about breaking things rather than building. That was the challenge for me. Previous classes (CN, DBS, GIOS) This has been an interesting course because I've had an interest in security. Hopefully in the future, they reduce the weighting of the midterm/final exams, emphasize the projects, and break the projects apart a little more. Unfortunately, the quizzes and exams are essentially rote memory tests. I watched the lectures, but found the book more informative and that's what the quizzes were largely based upon. The projects were the best part pedagogically.  This is a solid course in that it balances a lot of content (some of which will be unavoidably dry) with fun assignments that teach you the concepts (like hacking a VM to get root privileges).\n\nAll 4 projects were tricky in their own way and can be harder/easier depending on your knowledge.\n\nIn terms of languages, Project 1 requires some C, Project 3 required Python and Project 4 required some HTML/javascript.\n\nAll project are doable but you need to give them like 3 full days each unless they are squarely within your knowledge area. Luckily, you usually have about a month for each one, so you can spread these 3 days out. I was a big fan of this class even though the exams killed me (I did not prepare well enough for them, totally on me). Here's the breakdown of assignments:\n\n10 quizzes - these are all easy and straight from the book and some lectures. Mostly quizzing you on definitions and a few characteristics of certain ideas. Very few times will you find a \"gotcha\" type of question here. \n\n4 Projects - Project 1 was a stack overflow exploit in C. I was new to both C and this type of attack so there were some growing pains here (plenty of resources online). Project 2 I had a blast with, we analyzed malware running on VMs. Project 3 was about decrypting keys using Python. This was a lot of fun even though the grading came back less than I expected, probably my favorite project I've done in this program. Project 4 was all about using Javascript to exploit XSS attacks. The gotchas in this project were a bit rough for me but I got graded really well. \n\n2 Exams (not open book/notes) - It seems that most of these questions came from different places from the text and lectures. At times they could seem like really minute details for questions but it is what it is. If I were to have to do this class over I would go through all the lectures and take notes. This would have helped me a lot. Also the proctoring was a hassle for some students (I had no issues). \n\nExtra credit project - this is offered to give you an additional 10 points to your final grade. Unfortunately part of one of the extra credit projects is totally a \"get all the points or none\" kind of or deal. Seems like an odd format for students who need additional help. \n\nOverall you should get a decent-good grade in this course. I enjoyed it and at times wish I could have focused more on certain aspects of InfoSec. A whole course on network security, or malware, or decryption would be a ton of fun! I recommend this course to anyone, just do a better job of taking lecture notes than I did. I went into this class already knowing a fair amount about security. However, I really enjoyed the projects. They got me to do things that really cemented my knowledge, and that I wouldn't have done on my own. I'm glad they're making all 4 projects required. I felt like it was too easy with just the 2. The book is really boring. You will fall asleep over it. However, it is necessary and the lectures are pretty good to make up for that. To study for exams, use Quizlet. There are questions in there that someone created for another class based on the same book, which was helpful.  One of the most practical courses in the program. If you've been around the interwebs for a while, some of the topics will be very familiar, but this course may fill in some gaps in knowledge and give you more practice breaking/protecting systems. I really enjoyed the Assignments -- they're almost like puzzles that don't always seem clear at first, but there's a solution that's obvious after the fact. \n\nThe lectures are pretty unadorned, but cover the material. The one on RSA was a standout -- I finally understood something I've \"known\" for years. The tests and quizzes are multiple choice and pretty much straight from the book and lectures, but the questions are sometimes a bit ambiguous. \n\nThis is a good course to pair with if you're taking more than one. Great class and great structure. First things first: This was a course with an attached \"easy\" label\"; I'd say this is a course with a reasonable difficulty, **but I wouldn't categorize it as easy**. You'll need to study quite a bit and do a lot of research if you want to succeed, and most of that you'll do alone (books and resources are not provided).\n\nThe course lessons consist in video lectures from Udacity, and a textbook. They may overlap, but not necessarility.\n\nGrading is based on four take-home projects - which are just slightly related to what you see in lectures, ten open-book quizzes, and two closed-everything, one-hour proctored exams.\n\nThe projects are nice, and they'll force you to learn quite a bit on various security topics, but be aware: **most of the time you'll be on your own**. TAs will provide very limited help, and the professor is nowhere to be seen.\n\nAlso, sometimes you'll encounter badly worded, contradictory or plain wrong questions or requirements, be it in projects, exams, or quizzes: **try asking for clarifications, but don't expect proper answers**. Most of the times you'll be ignored. This is not so bad as it seems, because such questions are not a lot; but it can be frustrating if your final score is around a threshold for a grade. My suggestion is: **ignore them and go on**, you may think that spending time in \"fighting\" those will let you recover some points, but that won't work. Just go on.\n\nGeneral recommendations:\n* try achieving a 100% score in open-book quizzes. Their total value is the same as the two exams, so spend a bit of time on those, and take your time to crawl the textbook and the lessons for the proper answers.\n* start working early on projects, so you can ask on Piazza and Slack if you've got problems. **I recommend using textbooks** about the various topics, sometimes online resources are vague and make you waste time.\n* For the exams, **you must study all the lessons and the relevant chapters in the textbook**. Try understanding the underlying concept, but be advised that, without a good amount of luck, you won't get perfect scores there; some questions in the exams are overwhelmingly specific and you won't be able to answer them - but if you do well in projects and quizzes, an A is totally feasible. I wouldn't waste too much time on \"great exams\".\n\n\n Good: great topic and interesting materials. Challenging projects, with some hands on experience. \nBad: lack of clarification on some assignments, some ambiguous questions in weekly quizzes, and, most upsetting, absolutely horrible communication (meaning - absence of it!!) from TAs on Piazza private messages and emails. Unless staff will be changed, do not expect questions about your projects, grades and re-grading to be answered in those individual messages...  Course was good, it had a lot of work in Fall 2015 with weekly quiz and multiple projects and 2 exams. Between the lectures, reading and projects, it was about 10-12 hours per week. I got what I wanted out of this course which was a survey introduction to Info Sec. As others have said the projects are the reason to take this course. They are fun and interesting. \n\nThere is a lot of reading required for this course but I I think it can be avoided since the book is dry and strangely organized. You'll need to reference the text to complete the quizzes. For the exams, I found that skimming the text for information and then intense flashcard memorization before the test to be a successful strategy. \n\nI liked the structure and presentation of the video lectures. I thought they were organized well and did a great job of distilling relevant information from the text. \n\nFor me the weak point of the class was in terms of the leadership and administration of the course. There were some outstanding TAs in this course, who were generally available to guide students on projects and the concepts underlying them. However, when it came to matters of policy and offering a cohesive message on things that came up, particularly in terms of graded content, there was no unified voice, and sometimes questions would go unanswered. \nThere were some minor snags endured because the course switched from TSquare to Canvas but those were teeny and inconsequential. However, a few times, things that should not have mattered turned into frustrating issues because no one would address them.  This was my fifth course in the program, and I'm not convinced that this frustration is rooted in an unreasonable expectation of course organization and leadership. These courses can't entirely run themselves. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I took this course and would recommend it to anyone who is curious about the topic and has had no exposure to it otherwise.  A great introductory course to the world of information security as well as to the OMSCS program itself. There is a bit of a learning curve (and a larger workload) at the start of the semester, but the workload goes way down as you progress through the course. \nThe material is very interesting and the TAs are very active on piazza. The textbook readings weren't very helpful, but the projects more than made up for it. There were 4 projects, all of which were very immersive and very interesting. I would definitely recommend spending most of the time just working and understanding the projects in greater detail.  Like someone else said, this class was little more than a GPA booster. Don't expect to come out with a portfolio of projects that will get you into the security industry. Some of the projects in this course were almost exactly the same as an undergrad info security course I took from another institution. The support is terrible. They EMAIL quizes, I couldn't even find them at times. Really one of the worst supported classes I have taken (i had taken 7 already at the time. ) I would highly recommend not taking this class. If you have never programmed in python before, or not even a programmer, you could potentially struggle in some of the projects. If you have NOT done any sort of security work/study before, you have a TON of terms to memorize. If you have a basic understanding of security concepts and have programmed with python before, this will probably be the easiest class you can take in the program. \n\nIt is an OK overview of some security concepts, nothing revolutionary or exceptional. It will definitely be a \"filler\" course for most people and is best paired with other courses or utilized as an \"off\" semester to prep for some of the more interesting and difficult courses. Not much to say about this class. The topics were interesting, and the projects were easy but entertaining. This would be a great first course to take or to pair with another course, and I recommend it for anyone interested in computer security concepts. Just don't expect a ton of depth - rather, this course provides general information about many different aspects of information security. very interesting projects, get hands on real attacks. great course overall. I went in knowing nothing much about security. I found the information very informative and learned a ton. I feel I can discuss problems intelligently and discuss solutions. The information was interesting. Videos were well done, even though the first professor explained better than the second even though he was a bit repetitive. Overall, I'd rank it as one of my more enjoyable classes. Two things I'd recommend for improvement. One, the quiz questions seemed out of context and were many times pulled straight from book. The exam questions had alot of vagueness and felt were not written that well. The second complaint is that while the TA's were good about answering Piazza questions they were not so great at answering followups on Piazza. A followup question many times has as much meat as the original and kept seeing followups marked as satisfied when they clearly were not.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the class for the material and the projects were a blast and interestingly challenging. Only project I didn't enjoy as much was the virus analysis one. All the rest were really fun and cool. These was the best part of the class. I disagree that the class was super easy, I found certain parts hard and the projects always took some level of cleverness to solve. The exam were fairly hard and again the questions were not the best. I'd recommend the class and hope you enjoy. Sloppy, unclear presentation\nA lot of bad quizzes in the lectures (often all options are correct answers and similar things), not very helpful, ambiguous quiz answers\nVery strict weekly homework quizzes, often need to complete whole sentences from the book\nLast minute changes in due dates, confusing schedule, unclear pacing\nIncomplete project descriptions with a lot of fuzzy or under-specified requirements\nFun little projects, they do not require much effort\nDon't expect a deep dive, it's a very broad and somewhat shallow overview of mainstream, old security topics. \nDespite all the negative points I still liked the class, but mainly because it just gives me a solid foundation to further explore topics when they arise in my daily work.  A very simple class that provides a good overview of information security. Can be taken along with a time-consuming course as this course is an easy A. I liked this class a lot! The material was really interesting and most of the projects were exciting (yes I think that's the right word). Had a bit of difficulty studying for the test as the textbook covered many many terms, if you don't have experience in the industry it may be overwhelming. My tactic was to hit the projects early/hard and struggle to a B on the exams which makes an A very achievable in the course. This class had a lot of interesting material, but it was presented too quickly and shallowly. It really should be split into two courses. The assignments were somewhat challenging, but didn't do much to actually reinforce the material as it was taught. \n\nDue to the condensed summer schedule and size of the class, there were some issues that arose due to changing how assignments were going to be graded at the last minute, with basically no warning. \n\nThe Professor and TAs varied significantly in their Piazza presence and willingness to help. Generally, it was low all around.  I liked this course. Not having any real background in security, I felt it was good for my knowledge level. I can see where this could be mundane for those with security experience but thought the course was very well suited for my experience level with the subject matter. TAs were very good and responsive. I am familiar with information security but never had any actual projects or have done work with it before. The reading/lectures were a bit dry and I found myself dozing off most of the time :^)\n\nI was really interested in the cryptography section and this course was a great intro to the math and what goes behind the scenes. \n\nI found project 1 (buffer overflow) the most time consuming (10 - 15 hours) out of all 4 projects since it has been a while since touching C. I really enjoyed project 3 (cryptography cracking with Python) and project 4 (exploiting website vulnerabilities, should be familiar with PHP, javascript, HTML)\n\nFor exams, I reviewed the Udacity lectures and skimmed through the book. Mostly rote memorization. Overall, a pretty good course covering a lot of high-level topics.  The material in general is pretty easy and straight forward.  The only thing difficult about this course, speaking only from my perspective, is that a couple of the projects took me a substantial amount of time not because of the security related topic but because to complete the assignment it required knowledge of the project environment that I had absolutely no experience with; e.g., in the last project dealing with web vulnerabilities you have to work with Javascript, which was completely foreign to me, so I took more time learning about Javascript than figuring out the vulnerability.  Outside of the projects, I averaged 2 hours a week on this course to cover lectures, textbook, quizzes and exams.  But factoring in the time I took on the projects which soaked up a lot of time, it bumps my average way up.  They give you about 4 weeks for every project, so if you are not a procrastinator like me you should be good. This class has its moments, both good and bad. As others pointed out, there is a large breadth of topics covered (and a corresponding lack of depth), which similarly has pros and cons. \n\nThe good: A lot of the topics are quite interesting, and if you are not a security person already, you will probably leave this class more aware of some area(s) of security that can help you in your career. The technical meat of some of the projects can be both interesting, challenging, and fun. They make it easy to get an A if you put in the effort. \n\nThe bad: Sometimes, getting started on the projects is hard for the wrong reasons (environment setup, somewhat lacking documentation for specific things, etc). It is nothing that one can't get past, but if you have limited cycles, those problems can at times be frustrating. The really unfortunate result of that was that it was the crack in the foundation of the class opened up the floodgates of incessant whining on Piazza. I understand a bit of grumbling about the project setup problems, but people started complaining about every little thing, when the reality was that most people probably did fine in the class. I truly believe that if we hadn't had those project problems, people would not have complained so much about other things. Sorry fellow students, but please make sure you are making a constructive comment before you reach for that \"anonymous\" button!\n\nThe ugly: As with any security class, you will leave realizing how insecure everything is. Good luck sleeping!\n\nSecret key to success: Buckle down and do the readings (don't just skim!). It will makes the quizzes and exams easier, and there is sometimes a deeper dive of content, or even non-overlapping content in the texts. You will get more out of the class. \n\nFinal note: To the anyone that suggests Googling for quiz answers: are you sure you want to be in the program? If you just want a piece of paper, I there are some other lovely online degrees you can pursue.  I took this my first semester in the program and thought it was a great first course. \n\nThere are 4 projects. The first project required some understanding of GDB, the 2nd required no programming (analysis of malware), and the 3rd was implementing mathematical logic in a few lines of code. I am currently working on the 4th project, which appears to be the most challenging and open-ended design project. \n\n There are 10 open-book quizzes and 2 closed-book multiple choice exams. I found the first exam easy to study for by focusing on the assigned textbook readings and reviewing the quizzes. Definitely read the textbook as there is material covered on the exam that isn't presented in lectures, only the textbook.\n\nI took this course in combination with Intro to OS. I think Intro to Info Security is a good class to take in combination with others because you can easily catch up on it if you need to focus on a different class. I think the material is interesting and clearly presented. Course material is interesting. Learn a little bit about a lot of things. Not a lot of work though, in a lot of ways it feels like an undergrad class. Each project shouldn't take you more than an evening, exams are T/F and multiple choice. I was expecting this to be more challenging.  Really liked the class, but I liked more were the projects. You definitely must get the book for this class. This is a great intro class to information security. Low workload and easy & fun projects. Highly recommended. This class was very informative but since I don't have a great interest in security, it was kind of a drag. Although, some of the projects were enjoyable I don't think we were given enough to really know what we were doing for some. They expected us to search for answers or ask around which I find strange. This course involves lots of computer security concepts. Need to complete both video lectures and textbook chapters in order to do quizzes once a week. Some people liked the projects more than the others. You will use python, c, and JavaScript when working on projects. It is more about how you are interested in this lesson. Lectures to me have no interests at all. Each one is about 60min long on average and full of concepts.  I have learned a lot from doing the projects. Exam questions are sometimes not clear. People including me lost some points from T/F type of questions because of the grammar and ambiguity. For me, reading lecture notes created by other student helped me with exams. \n\nFor projects, make sure to use TA, piazza, and slack. Just try to prepare ahead of time since they give you like a month to do it after each project releases. I felt like I could have learned more if I started ahead of time because I probably would dived into the subject deeper. But I ended up working on projects too late so I worked just enough to get a good grade. Shame on me :( This course was a pretty good selection for my first semester in the program. The projects were by far the highlight of the course. All four of the projects are incredibly interesting and engaging and leave you with a much greater understanding of the topic of focus upon completion. Definitely touch up on your C and HTML/Javascript for the First and Fourth project before you take the course. The projects aren't extremely difficult but do require a fair amount of research and thinking. The course lectures/book reading is pretty dry, and, bar a few topics, I didn't really enjoy it. There's also quite a lot of reading. If you plan on taking notes the reading can be quite a time sink from week to week. The Exams do require you to spend some time understanding the material at a level greater than just simple memorization. Writing this review just after mid term. Course is pretty easy though you need to read thru whole book to excel good score in midterm and final. 20 quizzes with 1 point each, 2 out of 4 projects needs to be done. Each project is 10 points. mid term is 25 and final will be 30 points. 5 points for class participation. \n\nSyllabus is really good and interesting. The only point I can think of is you need to read whole book to score good points on mid term and final.  This review is written half way through the first semester, but so far I would consider this one of, if not the easiest class I have had so far. With that said, it is very interesting and I am learning a lot about IT security. \n\nClass grades are based of quizes, midterm/final, and completing 2 out of 4 projects. The first 2 projects were very easy. On the first, only writing a simple C program is required (ie. can you write a program to ask for a username and a password. ) The second required no programming and was even easier. Havent gotten to the 3rd and 4th yet, but as I stated you only need to complete 2 of the 4 projects. \n\nTo complete the quizes you do have to buy (or 'find' online) and read the book as the questions are word for word out of it. This is a very comprehensive course covering a lot of area of IT security. I am learning a lot and am looking forward to finishing.  TAs run amok, more time spent trying to trick students with wording than honest knowledge evaluation. Third project was basically \"use this really crappy app to gather research data for one of the TAs\". Seriously, I'm paying to run around surveying people.  This is a good class to pair with one that is demanding of time. You will learn stuff in this class (unless you already know all of the material) and the instructors have made it enjoyable and satisfying. Put in effort and you should do fine. Don't study and it will bite you! I'm writing this shortly after the mid term. So far the class has been easy and the material has been underwhelming. \n\nThe lectures for part one are very slow with lots of repitition. Definitely speed them up to 1. 5-2x as you watch. The text book is good but rather dry. Much of the first half of the course is just a formalization of things most of us already know. \n\nIt is still early but I am definitely liking the material in the 2nd half of the course better than the 1st. The lectures are faster and we are covering material with greater depth. \n\nThe projects are very nice. They are a bit challenging, require a good understanding of the concepts involved, and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time (~10-30 hours each). \n\nThe quizes and mid-term are basically regurgitations pulled verbatim out of the text at random. Quiz grades better reflect your ability to use the search function on the textbook PDF rather than an understanding of the concepts. The closed book mid-term had a median grade of 77. It is difficult not because of the material, but because the grader is looking for matches to random statements from the text book. TA's revise grades heavily and I'm confident the overall course will be graded on a curve but if you experience grade anxiety, this course may give you heartburn.  Assignments are the best part of this course. They are challenging and help learn the concepts better. The lectures could have been better. As the course title says, it is an intro course and hence material is spread thin across multiple topics. Gives you kind of a nudge in the direction of understanding information security broadly but you will need much more in case you plan to work in this area. NS/IIS form a good combination for people pursuing Computing Systems specialization. This class has a strong undergrad feel to me. Heavily text-book driven and essentialy T/F, multiple choice and short answer driven with the exception of the projects. The projects are pretty good and not that much work. All in all the class is okay but I wouldn't consider it a deep learning experience.  This was a great course.  Its not difficult and the instructor isn't around all the time but I don't think he really needs to be either.  The TA's did their best to answer questions and correct any errors and I thought they did a good job.  \n\nYou can put in little effort and pass the class. That's completely okay.  You can also do all of the readings assigned and independent research and expand on the projects on your own and learn a lot more.  This class is the epitome of you get out of it what you put in.\n\nI really enjoyed the projects.  They are not heavy on the programming but more of puzzles.  Projects included C, Python, Javascript, and reading PHP.  You only need to do very basic tasks in these languages and you don't need a deep knowledge in any of them.\n\nI even enjoyed reading through the book and I can't really say that about any other class.  I must like the subject matter. :)  \n\nThe exams are not difficult if you watch the lectures and do the readings.  The exams are very similar to the quizzes you take weekly.  The quizzes are open book. Overall, a good course. Provides a decent overview of computer security concepts, but doesn't dive into most of them very deeply. \n\nLectures:\nSome of the lectures are quite long. Most of them repeated or rephrased what was in the book. Not the best lectures I've had so far, but not terrible either. \n\nHomework:\nThere's a quiz portion to your grade. The quizzes are open everything and were taken verbatim from phrases in the textbook. To make the best use of them, it's best to read, watch lectures, and then attempt the quiz with everything put away. Afterwards, you can check your answers and submit. \n\nThe projects in this class were probably the best part. There are four projects that each focus on some aspect of computer security. Most required writing some code, while one consisted of analyzing malware. Each one took me 4 to 5 hours to complete, so not terribly hard. The project that dealt with finding vulnerabilities in a web application was the most fun. There were also some optional projects which could be used to bump up a low test or project grade. \n\nTests\nTests were multiple choice and proctored. They didn't take too long to complete, and if you actually were doing the reading, they were fairly straightforward. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThe TAs were fairly active on Piazza. Grading seemed fair to me, with most projects auto graded. There were a few projects that had hiccups, but the TAs seemed to fix them within a few days. \n\nAdditionally, it was nice that the class offered optional projects. \n\nBook:\nThe textbook for this class was interesting at its best, and extremely dry at its worst. You _might_ be able to get by without the textbook here, but it was extremely useful in studying for tests and quizzes. \n\nConclusion:\nWorth taking if you're looking for a summer class and don't have broad knowledge of information security concepts.  I took this course in my first semester as I could not get into any other courses. I did not like this course even though I got an A, may be its to do with the fact that I am planning to do ML specialization and therefore don't really care for many topics discussed in the course and only took this course to meet the \"Two foundation course\" requirements. \n\nAssignments are interesting but the nature of security industry is such that every vulnerability gets patched so fact so I felt like I was doing gimmicky assignments with not much practical use. I felt this was more like an undergraduate course. \n\nTAs are useless, they hardly ever reply on Piazza. The lectures are Dry. This was a self taught class and students were replying to each other. I was searching youtube and google for solution to assignment/assignment like problems and found quite a few. \n\nFor few weeks during the second half of the course I did not spend even an hr on the course.  \n\nTake this class if\na. You want a relatively easy A class. \nb. Security topic in general excites you. \nc. You want to take two courses in a semester and this one could be easier of the two. \n\nI would personally not take this class, I think it was useless from learning outcome perspective. But I guess an \"A\" on transcript helps.  Project 1 does include C programming, so be aware of that going in. With enough research, you can find some good sources to get you going in the right direction if you're strong suit is not at the system level of programming. Project 2 is decent and includes some malware analysis. Project 3 is possibly the best I've done in my few classes, heavy on the math behind cryptography (public key). It is very interesting and was created new for this semester. P3 is very interesting, I'm sure all will enjoy. P4 is also pretty neat as it revolves around internet security exploits. \n\nOverall workload for this class is pretty manageable. 5-10 hours a week. One major help is the bonus project, which can add 10% to your grade. This can cancel out a bad project or two if you need it (projects were 15% of our grade, tests 10%). \n\nThe downside during Fall 2016 semester was inattentive TAs. Our third project was released two weeks late due to all the TAs forgetting about it. It's likely that the professor will be more active due to this management gap in future semesters, so I wouldn't worry about it in the future. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this course. I learned a lot and found it very interesting. If there are any \"Security Now\" podcast listeners, this is the classroom version of the show; very interesting. There are now 4 required projects. Now takes more time than reported in Fall reviews. You could get by looking up the answers without reading the text, but if you want to get all you can out of the class, the reading can take a long time. The good: I've learned a lot. Interesting projects. Extra credit project available. The bad: poor or wrong instructions, mistakes in slides, and TAs who write wrong or confusing answers on piazza when they bother writing anything at all (which isn't often). When students can't figure out the mess they're given, they blame it on the students. It's hard to do project 2 without a good computer. You need 8G memory for the VM. 2 closed book exams, but not too difficult.  This is my second course in the program, and I would consider this a good beginner OMSCS course. The workload is very manageable. The content is not too difficult to understand. The projects don't require a very strong programming skillset. That being said, understanding some basic C and assembly will help with the first project which uses gdb to exploit a buffer overflow, so the ability to read/understand some assembly line by line is useful. The third project involves some Python but coding ability is again not the skill being tested. The final project involved HTML, PHP, Javascript. The exams are very conceptual and were significantly more challenging than the projects. Quizzes are easy and are the same final grade value as the two exams. The material starts off dry but gets very good by the first exam and the entire second half of the course covers some very interesting topics. Study hard for the exams, complete all the quizzes, and put some time into the projects, and it is a fairly easy A. I thought the class was extremely interesting. The lectures were a very high level overview of each topic. There were 10 quizzes (about one per week), 2 exams, and 4 projects. There was also an optional project for extra credit. Each of the projects probably only took 10-20 hours to do, but I enjoyed doing the work for them. I did not think it was too difficult or too easy. This is a class that you probably should have a background of C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and PHP, but if you don't, then you can probably pick up the skills required for this class pretty quickly. I was looking forward to this class but found it disappointing.\n\nThe textbook is not very engaging and I felt like there was too much assigned reading every week. There are weekly open-book quizzes, but they essentially pull questions from the textbook verbatim.\n\nThe projects are interesting and they are the best aspect of the class. Unfortunately, they can be a nightmare logistically. Almost every project was extended due to technical errors and issues. These are the same issues that are reported in previous reviews on here, so there is no reason for them to happen each semester. Often the instructions are unclear and questions on Piazza can go unanswered for a long time.\n\nThere are two exams and they often focus on minutia and trivia from the textbook and lectures. Like the quizzes, they are true/false and multiple choice, but they are not open-book.\n\nOverall, it feels like little effort was put into this class. There are two professors and only one briefly appeared on Piazza a few times during the semester. The tests focus on rote memorization rather than testing your understanding of the material and concepts. Despite all this, the class is still easy and can make a good choice to ease into the program with. I enjoyed this course immensely. The lectures were straightforward, the book is excellent, and the assignments are interesting and informative without being too time consuming. If you're going to take this course, it's good to know some basic number theory for the cryptography portion, but aside from that everything is covered well and is easy to pick up even for absolute beginners. This course was hot and cold for me.  I really liked 3 of the 4 projects.  The first, third, and fourth projects I thought did a great job of demonstrating the security issues for each topic, exposing me to the programming related to the topic, but not requiring advanced programming techniques in any of them.  This is a security course and they did well to teach that on these projects.  \n\nI didn't feel like I learned much from the second project other than I don't want to be a malware researcher.\n\nThe quizzes, book, lectures, and exams are all just ok.  Maybe because I'm not in the security field, but I found the material and how it was covered to be pretty dry.  Given that this course is highly relevant to our every day lives, I felt like the academic material could be more engaging.  \n\nOverall, I'd suggest this course for a student without a cyber-security background.  Take this as your first course to hopefully start out strong or pair up later on with another class that's not a time sink like cs-6200 was for me. easy couse Course mostly taught straight from textbook; as are the exams and quizzes. \n\nThe projects reflected material in the lessons generally; and were relevant and informative. The projects tended to require pre-knowledge of C and JavaScript to complete without a lot of extra effort. Also a newer machine than the course requirements indicate is required to install/run one of the projects.  - Lectures was okay. I felt like the material could have been presented in a more natural manner, even though there were many technical terms to explain. \n- Quizzes could definitely be improved. Many of the questions were taken straight from the textbook. If the instructors wrote their own quizzes, it could challenge the students to learn and understand the material better. \n- Lots of reading to do from the textbook if you want to get the most from the course. Although the instructor says all the quiz answers can be derived from the slides, I think some of that is a far stretch. I feel it is easier to personally fill in the gaps through reading the textbook. \n- Projects were enjoyable and challenging. There were four in total. The third was a new one in this semester that had a lot of technical issues and bugs. I don't think it was an appropriate project to ask students to test out a smartphone app. Fortunately, there was an alternative option for that project (which was a literature project and designing a smartphone app that uses pki). \n- Bonus extra credit was available if you complete additional problems related to a project. \n- Exams were fair. Multiple choice and T/F on proctortrack. \n- Professors and TAs were helpful. They even held office hours almost everyday in the week! That is amazing!!\n- Overall I enjoyed the content and recommend others to take this course too.  I took this in the summer, so there may not be as big of a workload in the fall or spring. There was also no extra credit offered. Overall the course is very informative, and I enjoyed taking it, but with the condensed semesters, I found it hard to keep up with everything, especially since I took the whole duration of time allotted to project 1 and was playing catch up for most of the semester. \n\nThe first project was in C, and was interesting, but took me a while to get. The second one did not involve any development, but was still interesting. The third was in Python, and the forth was in HTML / PHP / Javascript. I already took Networking and Network Security before taking this class, so the second half of the semester was pretty simple. \n\nThe quizzes aren't too bad, and were useful when studying for the exams. There is a good deal of reading, and the lectures are informative, but do not cover enough for the exams. I would recommend doing both the readings and the lectures. As with most summer courses, things moved along quickly due to a condensed schedule. This has led to some confusion around the extra credit assignment grading, but hopefully things will run more smoothly next Summer. \n\nAs per other reviews below, we are now required to complete all 4 assignments. They ranged from straightforward to tedious due to the wide range of skills needed. For example, the first assignment favored those who had a C-background while the last assignment favored those who were savvy with JavaScript. I would recommend doing a 'bonus' project, preferably one which is geared towards your own skill set. \n\nLectures were split between Mustaque Ahamad and Wenke Lee. Those given by Ahamad will literally put you to sleep. Lee keep a more brisk pace. I am not big into reading text books at all, but willed myself into reading this time due to many of the quiz (and therefore midterm and final) questions being pull from there. The quizzes are open book/notes and answers can easily be found online, but it is recommended to first attempt them without assistance since the midterm and final are closed book/notes. \n\nThe main reason that I took and would recommend this class is if you are going for the Computing Systems concentration. It fills that requirement nicely.  Projects were fun and challenging, and illustrated various real-world concepts in infosec. Took around 5-10 hours per project. Lecture/textbook content was painfully dry and tests and quizzes were often poorly-worded multiple-choice gotcha questions surrounding random bullet points in the lectures and textbooks. \n\nOverall, a good starter course for OMSCS. I really enjoyed this course. This is a cursory review of security, so no topic is dwelled on for too long in class (but you are of course welcome to spend more time on it, as there is plenty of supporting material provided). Although the lectures were often blah, the projects were the highlight of the course. \n\nI have very minimal programming experience, or experience with Linux, so I struggled with some of the projects, but they were very interesting and satisfying. I wish I was faster at figuring things out, as that would have given me time to do extra projects, which 1) counted for extra credit and 2) sounded very interesting. As it was, I learned a lot (mostly from projects but partly from lectures) and really enjoyed the semester. \n\nI would recommend this course to those who do not have much programming background, as it is doable and interesting; and for those who do, you'll spend way less time on the projects than I did, and that would enable you to dig into the subject matter even more.  The projects for this course are very fun. They seem simple at first, due to the fact that they are small, but they can be quite tricky to complete. You should brush up on C, pointers, Python, HTML and JavaScript prior to taking this course. The midterm and final are multiple choice questions using Proctortrack which come directly from the book. Ample time is provided to complete the exams, with time remaining to go over your answers. Make sure you complete one of the extra credit assignments, as it could make the difference between earning an A or a B in the course. Overall, you will learn a plethora of security concepts in this course, I highly recommend it. A good course if you need to wrap your head around security aspects .. its a very good beginners course .. I used a lot of concepts in my job. \nThe only thing is that instructors are not that active on piazza .. and the project descriptions can be a little vague, and would need clarifications on piazza ..  I really enjoyed this class, and especially the projects. I had prior backgrounds on some of the topics covered, and this class helped me to assemble the bits and pieces together. \n\nLectures: they cover really broad range of topics, from buffer overflow (low level application security) to web security. Each topic is not discussed in great details, but given that this course is an introductory course, this is quite expected. \n\nQuizzes: Most of the questions are taken straight from the book. If you watch the lectures and read the book, it is very easy to get 100% for the quizzes. \n\nProjects: The projects are fun, and help to understand and appreciate the topics better. Sometimes it takes a while to get what each project is about, but once you get a hang of it, the project can be done in a reasonable amount of time. (I spent about 7 - 10 hours per project) Furthermore the classmates are very helpful with the projects, even to the extent of almost giving away some of the answers. Most of the projects are auto-graded, so the answers are only either correct or wrong and no room for subjectivity. There were some hiccups with the auto-grading but the TAs quickly rectified them. \n\nExams: Similar level of difficulty with quizzes, not that challenging but good understanding of the concepts is needed to provide correct answers. \n\nOptional projects: Intended to be a grade boost, but it seems everybody did quite well so that the final grade curve was also boosted. Students are allowed to submit multiple optional projects but only one will go into the final grade. \n\nOverall it is a fun class, worth taking if you have little or no background in computer security. The workload is quite reasonable, and definitely will be lighter on normal spring / fall semesters.  I'll start with the good:\n\n1) The class has some fascinating topics. You'll learn the basics of how to do things like buffer overflows, malware analysis, encryption (cracking), and exploiting vulnerable websites. \n\n2)Some of the TAs were particularly good to work with. I'm looking at you Matt and Peter. \n\n3) Some of the projects were really fun. Project #1 (overflows) and Project #4 (web vulnerabilities). \n\n4) You get the opportunity for extra credit via an optional project that expands on one of the \"official\" projects. \n\nNow unfortunately the things I didn't like:\n\n1) I can't say this strongly enough, \"logistics\". I get this is a summer course so everything is condensed, but there were problems across the board regarding issues with projects and issues with autograders. The \"optional\" project grading policy was changed no less than 3 times within a week of the end of the semester. \n\n2) Get ready for some quizzes with \"subjective\" or \"ambiguous\" true/false questions. Good luck arguing them. They'll say not to read into them too much; but then come back at your challenge with some convoluted worded reasoning why you're wrong. \n\n3) The book is absolutely tedious to read. The authors need to understand the concept of \"run on\" sentences. \n\n4) Grades on practically EVERYTHING were held up because someone was suspected of cheating. \n\n5) Some of the projects seemed like straight busy work (cough Project #2). \n\n6) Some of the projects seemed like they added extraneous stuff just to make our life harder (cough Project #3). \n\n7) They'll crackdown on cheating, but let students ask questions on Piazza that practically go through step by step what to do. Seriously. Wait till a day or two before the projects are due and just read through Piazza and you won't need to do any work. This has got to be the biggest \"nope\" for me. I think it demeans the value of the program when people no longer have to try or even research on their own.  What I really appreciated about this class is the amount of prep work the professor and TAs did to give us semi-realistic systems to \"hack\", viruses to inspect, and examples of compromised code. I distinctly remember the fake bank account that we had to get into and the scavenger hunt assignment. The assignments/mini-projects tied the course together very well. The projects were interesting, challenging, and rewarding. I actually had fun doing a few of them. Several languages are required to understand or complete the projects: C++, Python, PHP, and SQL. Start and finish the projects early as possible and you'll be alright. The tests, on the other hand, were at easy to fair level. I over studied for them. \n\nMajority of my time was spent on reading practically the whole book to complete weekly quizzes, going through weekly lectures which didn't always intersect with book, preparing for tests, and coding/doing the projects.  This is a fairly easy course with very interesting assignments. My favourite would have to be the first one on C with return to libc attacks and the web one with XSS attacks. \n\nMy recommendation for studying midsem+finals is go through the quizzes and memorise definitions. It is quite a dry way of studying, but that strategy you should be easily able to beat the class average. As others have previously pointed out before, the quizzes and exams feel more like excepts and definitions pulled out of the text book so be prepared for that. This was one of my first courses in OMSCS. I had only surface level experience with information security, but after taking the course, feel quite knowledgeable. Most of it is directly applicable to my job, and is definitely a worthwhile course!\n\nThe best part of the course were the projects. Many of them were challenging (in a good way) and had a good coverage of a lot of different areas related to information security. The course definitely fulfilled my expectations of what Ga. Tech courses should be like. \n\nLooking forward to the sequel (Network Security) I took this class in my second semester along with AI. My first semester consisted of CS 6250 CN and CS 6340 SAT. I completed a computer engineering degree in 2014 as my only previous computer science exposure before this program for comparison to your circumstances.\n\nThis course is lighter compared to the harder courses in terms of pace and difficulty. The projects are less frequent at about one a month and are easier to figure out, especially when you have no background in the topic. I fell in this category for all of the projects so I averaged about 20 hours total a project between coding and writing the report. If you have significant experience in C with buffer overflows, or HTML/Javascript, then all of these projects can be completed in one night for you. The quizzes are straight from the lectures and book, so the book has great value for these. The tests focus on details and terminology from large amounts of chapters and lectures so memorizing that much information is the hardest part. The TAs and professor run the course very well and all our issues with Canvas will be figured out by the time later students take this course.\n\nI recommend this course as a great first course if you are coming from a technical background that is not computer science or engineering. This can also be paired with the harder courses like AI, ML, and GA.  Loved this class Light course to begin with. Gives a basic idea of how various malware attacks work and how they can be detected. \n The projects were the best part of this course. I found the first one to be pretty frustrating and a bit poorly executed (we had to use gdb and the only guidance provided was an inadequate ten minute YouTube video with no audio), but the other three projects were fun, interesting, and engaging, with manageable difficulty. There was also an optional project which meant even if you struggled on a project or exam you could still fare ok. Project 1 was C-based, and having some acquaintance with C was nice, though I think one could manage if familiar with another language. Project 2 was not especially language dependent. Project 3 required some basic python skills. Project 4 required you to be able to read or write HTML, JavaScript, and PHP, but having only minimal familiarity with those I was still able to figure it out, so I wouldn't over-stress about those. \n\nThere was a ton of lecture material for the course, which got tiresome. In particular, the videos for the first half of the course are extremely long-winded and even at 1. 5x or 2x were quite repetitive. \n\nMany of the quiz questions are lifted verbatim from the textbook. Because of this, many students found a searchable soft copy to be convenient. I had a hard copy of an old edition and it was definitely adequate. \n\nAlthough I was successful on the exams, they didn't feel like especially high quality assessments. The projects were certainly a superior source of learning. \n\nThe most disappointing part of the course was that there was virtually zero instructor presence on Piazza or office hours. Luckily a couple of the TAs were helpful via Piazza or available for consultation office hours and peers were helpful on Piazza. I got the feeling on Piazza that students who struggled on the projects would have appreciated a lot more guidance and instructor participation. Since it seemed the TAs were in charge of designing and managing the projects, it left me wondering what the instructors were actually contributing. I enjoyed this class, mostly because the projects were quite fun. They are like a series of puzzles to solve. They are very open ended, and the steps to complete them are left to the student to figure out, but generally speaking, you know when you've got it right thanks to well defined completion criteria or provided test data to compare against. The first project requires GDB, which I'd never used before. If you're comfortable with debugging in any language, this should be no problem. Knowing JavaScript, HTML, DOM, and some basics about how the event model works in a browser is very helpful for the last project. The weekly quizzes actually help learn the material because you can take them over and over. I took them at the beginning of the week, then looked for the answers while reading the text and watching the lectures. Then you can get a 100% by taking it again at the end of the week. There are two proctortrack exams that follow the same true/false and multiple choice format of the quizzes. They are not difficult, but some of the questions are poorly/awkwardly worded in a way that was frustrating. Getting the text book is required as many questions for the quizzes and exams come from the text and are not explicitly covered in the lectures. There was a ton of reading assigned, and as I got further into the semester I decided to forego the reading.\n\nOverall, the course was interesting and the projects were really fun. I would suggest leaving a lot of time for the first project (buffer overflow). Overall I liked the class and learned quite a few things on computer security - topics cover pretty much the entire course book. I found reading the book to help with understanding some of the lecture materials which were complicated. In some cases I skipped lectures and read the chapter instead. \n\nIn cryptography it was the first time I understood what cracking of prime numbers problem is really about - through theory of Modular arithmetic. \n\nOverall, you will learn as much as you put in - if you come in just for the grade that's what you will get. If you come in for the material you can read a lot in reference materails and on the web to supplement the course. It's totally up to you. \n\nProjects - many projects looked easy to start with, but by the time I was done with them I had spent a good 15 to 20 hours on each. In some cases even more time to setup and run the programs. \n\nOverall, I recommend this course to all who are in the systems computing specialization. ", 
    "CS-6200": " I have an undergrad CS degree so based on the topic outline in the course description, the class did not seem like anything new. I took this class thinking it would be an easy summer class. For me personally, it required a lot more work than I anticipated especially on the project side (programming side). Might be just me, but I felt like the test were trickier, basically not doing as well on the test as I thought I did when I took the test. Make sure you know C or have done some C programming before you take this class, there are MANY people who drop out during the first project just for this reason of thinking they will learn on the fly and are not able to keep up. From the perspective of someone with a undergrad CS degree (obviously this will vary based on your undergrad CS program rigor) everything up to about a little after mid term I already had familiarity with or forgot (Obviously the class went in greater depth of the topics I already covered in undergrad so I learn't new stuff here and there in the first half of the content). On the second part of the semester is where It covers virtualization and distributed systems, RPC and was where I really saw new content for me personally. If I took this during the longer semester I probably would have rated this class a medium difficultly based on my background. \n\nLike I said prior, unless you are pretty good in C, the projects will consume A LOT of your time and the test seemed tricky or maybe for the summer I was just a bad test taker.. Luckily I got the grade I needed and probably deserved. I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to build their OS fundamental and/or C or system programming knowledge. Background: No undergrad CS degree but have taken several non OMSCS courses for CS (DS and algorithms, obj. orient. design patterns). 1 year of industry experience. Basic knowledge of C. Received an A in the course. \n\nLectures are well done. However, the projects go over only several of the topics covered in lecture. Resist the temptation to save all of the lectures for later. \n\nProjects are done in C. Skeleton code is given, but a lot of thought needs to be put into how your implementation can play nice with the pre-written code. Also, a lot of time is spent wrangling with the autograder; sometimes the autograder doesn't provide any meaningful or consistent output. Projects are judged against several test cases; a difficult point for me was anticipating some of these test cases, but the project rubric and other people's questions and answers on Piazza gave helpful hints on what cases to anticipate. \n\nSpeaking of Piazza, questions are answered quickly, either by students, or the TA/the professor. Office hours are also consistent. \n\nNumber of hours spent: I had to work during lunches (every day during weeks when projects were due or an exam was being held), and an hour or two after work if I'm not already wiped out. Also had to devote several hours on weekends for projects and studying for exams. \n\nOverall, a very solid and straightforward class. There aren't any tricks or gotchas in my opinion, and results will accurately reflect the amount of work you put in. Be prepared to put in a lot of work though.  This was a fantastic first course for me. I am an experienced software engineer with a few years of experience without a CS undergrad degree. OS concepts was something I wanted to learn out of OMSCS. This course provided a nice introduction to these concepts, at least to a point where I know where to look for for more information. It is not as detailed as a standard OS course at a top-tier school, though. For example, in my undergrad school, I know that CS majors had to actually write an OS from scratch as the project for this course. This course only requires us to use some of the OS features to implement some applications. This course covers a breadth of information in an easily ingestible way. But it does not go deep into any of the concepts.\n\nBasic knowledge of programming is absolutely necessary. If pointer, references and SIGSEGVs scare you, this course is probably not for you. You don't need to be an expert in C, but you need to be comfortable developing small applications, and with basic debugging. Nothing you can't learn in ~1 week if you already know Java or another equivalent language.\n\nThe instructor, Ada, was fantastic. The lectures were very well made. Ada was available in Piazza to help out fellow students. The exams were great, the TAs were always prompt. All in al, a very well-organized course. I feel spoiled for future courses! :)\nHighly recommended! The 1st, 3rd, and 4th projects in this course are excellent. The 2nd project is an incomprehensible and poorly-designed quiz in T-Square that needs to be scrapped. \n\nThe lectures are taught at lightening speed, though they tend to be relatively sufficient for teaching the material. I'd suggest slowing down some of the more critical lectures or providing more examples. \n\nOverall this course was a pretty good one, and though I came in relatively knowledgeable about the material I still learned quite a bit. Lectures - great content. Ada communicates all the concepts clearly and at a sufficient level of detail. Lots of quizzes built into lectures that actually solidify your knowledge retention. I learned so much, and covered so much breadth as well. \nProjects - I really enjoyed these as well. It is all C programming and I've never done C, so there was some growing pains in the beginning. I recommend you at least take some intro to c course, and definitely review c strings (and what the str* functions do vs mem* functions), and pointer management, and the difference between c strings and buffers. Those were the gotchas that seemed to get majority of the Piazza posts. \nExams - These were pretty difficult. A lot of gotcha questions as well. You could know the concepts yet still do poorly on the exam. Also the midterm only covered a small portion of the material.... and that left the majority of the material for the final. And that was a lot to study!\n\nNow the best thing about this class was actually the unofficial slack channel. The TAs hung out on there and were so active, always responding to questions, carrying on discussion of concepts... I do wish I run into more classes with TAs like these. \n\nThe worst thing is the amount of people that thought they could get away with cheating in this class. The TAs here spend considerable effort at discovering and pursuing cheaters, on both projects and exams. They take this issue very seriously and managed to catch many. It's unfortunate that so much of their time and effort had to go into something that shouldn't happen, instead of on grading and improving projects. Be a considerate person, don't cheat. Great class.  As someone who did not know C before taking it, some of the projects were BRUTAL.  However I learned a ton, much of which is applicable to my work and any software development job.\n\nHighly recommended if you feel like you have a gap in knowledge in what is happening under the hood when the code is running, what is really happening with threads and memory, etc.  At the end they go into virtual machines, distributed computing and cloud computing which was really interesting too.\n\nThe class was extremely well run, the Professor and TA's were always available to assist and answer questions on Piazza.  Even on Sundays sometimes!\n\nI did not like how heavy the grading favors the tests - I spent 100+ hours on the projects and probably less than 10 studying for the exams, but the exams are weighted as 60% of grade.  However this may be necessary because projects do not go into a lot of the information presented in the course.  And apparently last semester the curve was such that a 55% gave you a B, so maybe it doesn't matter too much. Overall a great class. I learned a lot about the mechanisms and abstractions that go on under the hood in an operating system (specifically Linux) as well as how to put them to use in building applications. For me this was a perfect class for the earlier part of my degree program (2nd class). \n\nThat being said, this learning came at a fairly high cost to me. Going into the class I considered myself a 'novice' in C and 'intermediate' in a couple other languages (I didn't graduate as CS undergrad). The first project is estimated to take ~30 hours, and it took me 70 hours. The next two took me ~45 and ~25, respectively. I'd say if you are already proficient in programming in C or have the time to make yourself proficient, this class is definitely worth the effort. \n\nAlso, Prof Ada, the TAs, and my classmates were all very active and very helpful on Piazza. Prof Ada held office hours every week via Hangouts On Air, so they could be reviewed on YouTube at your convenience. Very engaged staff that really want to see you succeed, regardless of your familiarity with C / Linux stuff. First course in OMSCS. Highly recommended. \n\nWith only hobbyist-level experience in C, I could dive into the meat of the projects and found all of them challenging but fulfilling. Lectures kept my attention and sample exams proved useful in studying. Professor Gavrilovksa and TAs stayed very responsive in Piazza all semester. \n\nI would prepare for this course by establishing familiarity with (a) running VirtualBox VMs, (b) using source control in projects, (c) editing and understanding Makefiles, (d) debugging with valgrind or gdb, and (e) browsing system documentation such as manpages. \n\nOn Project 3 I got more pain than gain from Udacity autograder, but TAs allow you to tarball whatever you want and submit in lieu of Udacity. In my case they graded my tarball very fairly.  Before coming into the course, I had 10+ years of experience in developing C and C++ based distributed networking applications that used IPCs such as Sockets in a big way. Still I had to sweat a bit to complete all the assignments in IOS. C was not a problem, but the autograder warrants/enforces implementation in a certain (generic) manner which reflects constraints on real-world commercial applications such as web-servers. \n\nHaving said that, the assignments were fun, the video lectures even more so. The class is very organized. The instructor and TAs are very active in Piazza and go above and beyond in clarifying concepts. Office-hours are held every week. \n\nRecommendation to students: Stick to the schedule specified and start your assignments early. Even if you are GOD in C, you will end up spending sizable amount of time for all assignments.  This was my first course in OMSCS and it was absolutely brilliant. It set the bar incredibly high for what online classes should be. \n\nThis course should be required to graduate. The workload was very manageable and the lectures very interesting. I had been writing file systems for about 4 years when I took this class and I managed to learn a worthwhile amount. I found this course to be a good introduction to operating systems, especially having never taken an OS course before. Since this is now my 9th course in OMSCS I've certainly run the gamut in terms of quality of courses. That being said, I'd say IOS is one of the better ones (my favourite and best being KBAI) for the following reasons:\n- The video lectures are well organized, the concepts are explained clearly, and quizzes are thoughtful and helpful in reinforcing topics. \n- Instructor and TA involvement was exceptional in Piazza. They fostered a collaborative learning environment which helped bring learning above and beyond just the video lectures\n- The projects were helpful and fun to do. As rusty as I am in C, the projects were a nice refresher and departure from my usual day-to-day work in higher level languages. If you start early on the projects and get involved with class discussions, there's no reason you shouldn't succeed on the projects. There are also plenty of extra credit opportunities that weren't hard to complete and ended up saving my grade. \n\nMy concerns with this class:\n- Exams: although mostly straightforward, they were tricky and sometimes required remembering one small lecture detail. The midterm and final exam weren't evenly split over lecture material with the final covering significantly more lectures. In this regard, I highly suggest that you keep pace with the class syllabus. \n- Grades: We received our project 1 and midterm grades back fairly quickly, but didn't get project 3 grades (which was due in the middle of the semester) until nearly after the final. Not having a good pulse on your grade was mildly frustrating. \n- Bonnie: Project submissions are handled through Udacity's testing framework, Bonnie, which had a few hiccups throughout the semester which were eventually resolved. I did like the instant feedback it provided. \n\nHow to succeed and other advice:\n- Keep up to pace with lectures, projects, and reading material. With regards to the reading material especially towards the final, I found that just focusing on the papers that were discussed in lecture were most important. There were some lengthier papers that, although interesting, contained far more detail and concepts than the class exams or projects required. \n- I bought the Silberschatz Operating Systems Concepts textbook but only cracked it open once or twice because the lecture material was complete in itself and Piazza was an excellent supplement for answering questions. I regret buying the textbook, but YMMV. \n- Invest time in setting up and understanding your C development environment. It will save you time in the long run when you're trying to debug a segfault. Use an IDE like CLion (free for students). It helps highlight syntax errors that you could otherwise miss. Learn the basics of vagrant (virtual machine), valgrind (memory leak checker), and gdb (C debugger). \n\nOverall I'd rate this course an 9/10 and would highly recommend it. It wasn't part of my specialization, but I'm happy to have taken it because it rounded out my understanding of basic CS concepts.  Great class. I had taken an undergraduate course in Operating Systems years ago, and this blew it out of the water in terms of depth and breadth. You'll get to learn about some low level, classical OS material and get into more modern ideas supporting concurrency, virtualization and distributed systems. Some of the lectures are pretty dense, so you'll probably want to watch them in pieces rather than all at once. There were 3 projects and an extra credit project this semester, and they were all in C. If you don't know C already, this is where the bulk of your difficulty in the class will come from. Some of the code templates given used syntax and operators I'd never seen before, and this created a lot of difficulty for me. If you're well versed in C and navigating Linux man pages already, you're probably fine. Exams were tricky, but I didn't find them exceptionally hard despite their reputation. The course is curved, and the boundaries seemed pretty generous. If you mess up more than one project you can still walk away with a B if your exam scores are above average. \n\nTAs are pretty responsive on Piazza, but don't rely on them to help you at the last minute - ask early and you should be good. Project grades take a long time to return, but this semester had an unusually high number of students so I kind of expected this going in. Make sure to pass Bonnie tests - they seem highly correlated with the end grade of your projects. \n\nThere was also a very active course Slack this semester where you can get fast help if the TAs are online. Professor Gavrilovska holds office hours every week (not just the TAs), so you can get help there too. I'd recommend this course early if you're looking into the Computing Systems specialization and need to brush up on low level OS material, but be warned - it's a deceptive amount of work. Definitely worth taking. This was one of my first classes and I went in with 0 experience with C. The concepts were well explained and I picked up on them quickly but the projects were absolutely the most painful projects still to this day. At the end of each project I could look back and it wasn't an unreasonable amount of work but I struggled at every step. I think the first project was creating a socket messaging app and not even understanding how strings and pointers work in C it was a big jump. All in all I'm glad I took the course and I learned a lot but if I went back I definitely wouldn't have enrolled without an intermediate understanding of C. Ada and the TA's were awesome. Only complaint was Project 2 was a little more difficult due to confusing instructions than it needed to be. Material was useful and projects were at the appropriate challenging level. The use of an auto-grader that was exposed to the students meant students could learn from their mistakes and make correctly functioning code. You *WILL* have to program in the C language. GIOS was my first course in OMSCS and I found it to be a good place to start. This course does have quite a bit of material that you need to get through in addition to the projects, but I found everything accessible with my CS background.\n\nThe biggest advise I would give for students considering taking this course is to brush up on C ahead of time which will make your first project much easier. If you are taking this course, make sure that you start your projects as soon as possible. Waiting to the last minute just adds stress.\n\nOverall, great course, great instructor. Would definitely recommend. This was my first semester, and I took this class along with another course. I took this class in order to strengthen my understanding of OS's, as I wanted to improve my grasp on fundamental CS concepts. Professor Ada and the TA's were amazing and responsive. Since this was my first semester, this class has set a high bar for my courses as it was very well organized and lectures were quite clear. \n\nAssignments were very helpful in deeply understanding some of the OS concepts we covered. Two of them were time-consuming, and I learned very quickly that I needed to start early in order to succeed. That said, it really helps to be familiar with C before the class; I think a lot of people will agree that one of the reasons why the first assignment is so tough is that many people are learning C in the process of doing that assignment. \n\nThe exams (midterm and final) are tough and cover a wide range of concepts, some of which can get very dense. So again, it is best to start very early when studying for the tests -- do not cram!\n\nThis class was definitely challenging but certainly worthwhile. Grading was tough but fair, and you are set to succeed if you put in the effort, even if you make mistakes along the way. It was intense at times and sometimes stressful, but so worth it. Would highly recommend! This is a great subject which really helped develop my C skill - a language which I use on a daily basis. I got a exposure to different workflows and importantly now better understand operating systems. The projects are time consuming and there is a lot of depth and variety to the exam material. Regarding the projects I think there were a few misconceptions - firstly I don't think that C is a massive hurdle here that it is percevied to be. I think the real challenge is coming up with a suitable design to fulfill project objectives. I acknowledge that the autograder can be frustrating at times but it did make me think critically about what I was intending my code to do and what it was actually doing. When I reconciled my design and objectives the autograder would be happy. Secondly, I spent too much time on design and underestimated the amount of testing that was required. The projects are a little thin on specification so it is more or less up to you to devise suitable test cases that match what you think the project objectives are. The marks that I lost in assignments were in hindsight I think due to not thinking more about testing. The problem here is that you will clock a lot of hours. At some point I just had to say enough and move on.  Most comprehensive video material in any course that I have attended in OMSCS.  This was an amazing class. The lectures were exceptional, the TA's and professor were very helpful and active on piazza. The course has a mid-term and finals which will make you take a lot of notes. The prjojects where the major time-sink for me even though I had a fairly good understanding of C. I may have easily spent over 100 hours on project 3. It was a struggle to get your code pass Udacity as the feedback was extremely vague but it also meant that there was a bug in your code. I would proablby have spent half the time on the project if it was not for submission through Udacity and ended up losing points for bugs I woulndt have caught other wise. Other than the TA's, the other class mates were extremely helpful in ironing out many issues. The exams were well planned and didn't need you to really rote learn anything. As long as you understood the concepts, you would do well.  If you are VERY comfortable with high level C programming and Linux you might be okay. There is no quarter for the inexperienced though. Give it a pass - neither OS class is required to graduate anymore. I will most likely be dropping. This class would strain the unemployed.  I have mixed feelings about this class: Let me start by saying that the lectures are amazing and great for learning. They're the best thing about this course. However, the projects are extremely frustrating. A lot of people think that it's due to C programming. But I don't think so. They're frustrating because they're contrived to be difficult. The instructor has only one solution in mind. But they don't provide you any guidelines. And then you have to spend endless hours trying to figure out what they had in mind. Obviously there are so many other ways to solve the problem. But you're constrained to figure out what to do with the terse and convoluted code skeleton provided without much explanation. And then there's the whole mess of the autograder which only works with the solution they had in mind. Other working solutions might fail the autograder with mysterious messages. The TA's would never acknowledge the problems with the autograder and would always blame it back on the student. The only help they provide is very genericand doesn't help much. At the end of all of it, you're not given any solution guidelines. So you don't really learn what you did wrong and how you could improve. I have professional experience using C for a couple years. C is not the problem. I have a job that requires no more than 40 hours a week. But at the job I have to be intense and sharp. This course has definitely affected my job. All these hours of frustrating project work got to me and it was interfering with my work. I'm not sure I would recommend taking this course if you're full-time employed. I definitely learned a few things. But was it worth all the effort and frustration? I'm not sure This was a great class. I learned a lot about OS, and since I've never had a strong OS background, a lot of the information was new and fresh to me. The assignments are programming-intensive in C, so a good solid foundation in C is an absolute necessity. The assignments weren't that difficult, but they are time-consuming (in a fun way if you like to program!). I think two of the projects took about 10 hours each, and the other two less than 5 hours. The grading scale was extremely generous.  Professor Gavriloska is exceptional. She is dedicated to her students and making the course smooth and well organized. Really enjoyed this course. Had very little C experience going in, so I had to learn it on the fly. Not a huge deal, but someone with more C experience would find it easier. The autograder was a complete pain in the ass. But it was very rewarding when you finally got your code to pass. Some of the later stuff wasn't as interesting to me and we didn't have projects that covered it. Overall, I highly recommend this course for people that haven't taken an OS course or are looking for a refresher. This is my first course of the OMSCS program, overall great learning experience. The course covers many OS topics with focuses on design and implementation of concurrency system, i. e. , CPU, memory, IO and file systems. I would say the course is very well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are very engaged , and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you in the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. \nI am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with picking up C. I believe, this is the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (trust me, I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher myself in a European university before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\" :)\n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course.  Excellent class. You should be comfortable with C before taking this class. The projects really help solidify some of the material.  This was my first class in the program, and I really enjoyed it. I came into this course with plenty of C knowledge, and I thought I understood Operating Systems concepts well (turns out I did not). I would say with my background, this course is more like a medium difficulty because of the amount of content, but for those new to C or OS concepts, I suspect it would be quite hard. That said, it is an achievable course, and with the generous curving policy it does not aim to make your life difficult. If you complete the work and give the class a fair shot, you will probably earn a B. Earning an A takes a bit more work.\n\nProjects are described in better detail on other reviews. With my C background, Pr1 took about 10-12 hours, Pr2 took about 4-6, Pr3 took about 8, and Pr4 took about 5. I would say they are difficult, but at no point did I feel like I was lost without any clue what to do next. If you reference the readme, make use of search functionality in Google, Piazza, and Slack, and when that fails, ask relevant questions, the projects are quite achievable without any existing C knowledge. But I will admit they would be quite difficult if you haven't been exposed to much C. I would say you could double or triple my times if you're trying to learn C along the way. It would be a good way to learn C, for what it's worth.\n\nExams are difficult. I thought I understood OS material already, but the course went much deeper into how things work under the hood. It does a good job of exposing you to important academic research in the field, and gives you some of the early building blocks of how things came to be. The exams are multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank for calculations, but they are far from easy. You will not do well if you haven't absorbed the lecture material and given the paper readings a fair shake. The exams are both quite fair, though. The practice questions provided give you a very good view of what will be on the test, but again, they are not easy.\n\nThe course makes it very easy to participate. A TA has opened up a private paid slack instance which to me was invaluable this semester. It allowed many people a place to get more instantaneous help with projects and material, as well as get to know each other and create decent relationships, for an online program. If Piazza isn't your thing, this is a great resource to have. Either Slack and Piazza participation counts for a small portion of the final grade, but there are plenty of opportunities to contribute.\n\nMy advice on this course would be to brush up on basic C concepts, and hit the ground running. Use the first week to get ahead on lectures and readings, so that when the first project comes out you can start work immediately. The only people I observed struggling with it to the point of not completing it were those who started it halfway through the deadline. There is generous time given to complete the projects, which makes it ripe for procrastination, but do not. I would also advise you to get ahead on the second half of the course - the material on the final is about 2 times the content of the material on the midterm, so work quickly through that material to allow plenty of time to review for the final.\n\nIf you come in with some interest in the subject, it is a very rewarding course. I like that it doesn't hold a grade over your head, which helps with enjoyability... but you do have to do the work to obtain it. In my opinion it makes an excellent first course, as it is well-run, the TAs are available and helpful, the professor actively participates despite the large class sizes, and the projects are well put together and help expand on the material you learn. I took this course to satisfy my 2nd foundational course, and passed it with an A. This is an intensive and rewarding course if you're interested to learn about OS design. It will hammer you to learn Linux System Programming with C using POSIX API. \n\nThe projects are time-consuming, but they're fun to do. Most assignments and exams include optional questions to gain Extra Credit. In addition, grades are curved generously. The average final grade was A. \n\nIf you'd like to take this course during Summer, note that you will end up allocating your weekends to complete the C programming assignments.  If you don't know C well, especially concepts like pointers, pointer arithmetic, function pointers, sockets, string manipulation and memory management (malloc, free, and tools like valgrind), then it would be best to brush up on those in advance. Everything else is explained in the lectures. Projects 1 and 3 are large and complicated and will require a lot of time -- especially if you have to try to learn C at the same time. I would highly recommend starting the projects as soon as they are available to make sure you have enough time to finish them (and try to get it through the autograder). The code skeletons and Udacity autograder are new this semester, as I understand it. I personally enjoyed the projects the most from this class, and while the autograder can be frustrating at times (when the feedback is too vague, or you don't really get any at all), I was always able to find the issue by doing more testing of corner cases myself, which would uncover a crash or deadlock in certain circumstances. The benefit is that you once you've passed the autograder you can be confident that you've done things correctly. I also like the new phased approach to the first project, where you have a few 'build-up' assignments that you should complete before the main project. I personally didn't find the code skeletons a problem or too restrictive, although understanding how it all fits together can be overwhelming at first. By looking at what is given in the skeleton and how certain functions are defined you should be able to figure out how to make everything fit together. Although, I'm not a programmer, so perhaps having some 'embedded direction' is more helpful to me than someone who has a lot more experience.  Loved this course! The material is very valueable. Videos are very Informative. Projects are interesting. Professor and TAs are helpful. Midterm and Final are long and cover many areas. Programming in C is the most challenging part of this class. If you programmed in a similar language like Java, you should be good. If you haven't code in a while or are not used to a C-styled language, this is going to be hell for you. I strongly recommend going over the Lynda C programming course before taking this class. I wished I took this class in the Fall or Spring instead of the Summer session.  This class really required some quick development of C knowledge. It touches a lot of relatively basic concepts regarding threading, memory, hardware functions, scheduling, and more. The projects in the course were logically intensive and super time consuming for someone new at C. I spent tons of time trying to figure out problems that were just incredibly simple mistakes. It was very satisfying once projects were complete, but incredibly frustrating to get there. The course also has a huge breadth of information and the tests are more rote memory than logical deduction. The lectures were good, but the huge amount of information was often overwhelming and not as interesting as following a single line of logic. Overall it was a solid course and certainly filled a gap I had in OS knowledge.  I took this class after already having taken an undergrad OS course and with good familiarity with C. Having that background made the class a bit easy, but the tests will still require some studying. The midterm and final were fair but most of the questions could have been answered with only watching the videos, the papers take a long time to read and aren't heavily represented on the tests.\n\nThe projects aren't too difficult if you already are familiar with C but they will still take some time to complete. The projects taught concepts that were new to me, such as shared memory and inter process communication, so they were enjoyable. The TAs are active and answer questions quickly.  Lectures: Very well done, the professor was very knowledgeable in the subject matter and provided enough information for you to get started on the projects. \n\nProjects: All were written in C. If you are completely unfamiliar with C i recommend taking a quick refresher. The projects were very challenging but I feel I really learned a lot while completing them. Even though the project were challenging, the slides provided enough information most of the time for you to get started and use google to figure out the rest. \n\nExams: Standard proctored exams that cover a specific set of material. Not cumulative. As long as you study you will do fine. \n\nGrading: Grading was extremely fair i thought. A lot of the projects used a \"unit test\" method through Udacity and the results of those tests gave you a pretty good understanding of what grade to expect. Final grade was curved. \n\nOverall: Great class but very challenging. Do not take this with another class unless you have a lot of time on your hands.  The lectures are well organized but very theoretical to me, and I had to admit that I hardly understood the last four lectures at all... Even though I watched the Videos again and again. So I had to guest the answers of the final... So sad. If you took this class, please take advantage of the office hours, I hope I could have time... \n\nFor the projects, they were very frustrating for me, and I had to submit them just before the deadlines becourse I don't know how to do it... Until I got the hints from Pizza and I had to submitted an Imcompleted one. The good news is that there were lots of experts on Piazza and they really warmhearted and answered all my questions. Without their help, I can't complete this course. \n\nI really love Ada and the TAs of this course, I just hope I could understand the materials better, but I can't at this point... I just don't understand the lectures, they are too abstract and hard to me. I wish I could understand them better during my journey in OMSCS.  First class in OMSCS with no academic CS background (though I have an undergrad engineering degree), no C experience, and 2+ years in professional web development.\n\nThis class is extremely well run and I commend Professor Ada and all of the TAs for their efforts to make Piazza and Slack as helpful as possible. The lecture content is somewhat dense at times but Ada does a great job of explaining concepts and I found her lectures extremely useful. There are two exams that are certainly tough but you only need to study the lecture material to do well on them. I'd recommend reading the assigned papers but the main concepts from them are also covered in lecture and I didn't bother to re-read them while studying for exams. This approach netted me above average scores on both exams which largely contributed to my A in the class.\n\nThere are three projects whose difficulty will depend on your familiarity with C. I came into the class with no C experience and definitely had my struggles on the first project, but I managed to power through it and felt far more comfortable for the rest of the class. Despite this I'd caution against taking this class with little/no C experience unless you consider yourself a strong programmer, otherwise you may be in for a rough ride. The first two projects are both difficult and time consuming and I would start them as early as possible because you are going to run into issues with C/Bonnie/etc along the way. If you manage to get through those you'll find that the last project takes significantly less time. The good news is that you have access to the autograder (Bonnie) for all projects so you generally know what grade you're going to get when you turn the project in. I put significant effort into the projects and got full points on all three, though I know students got docked minor points for poor READMEs and other small things.\n\nYes this class is hard and you're going to get frustrated during the projects, but your efforts will be rewarded by a solid foundation in operating systems and you will no longer fear C. This is my first class in OMSCS so regarding difficulty I don't have enough info to determine, but it's not obviously \"easy\" especially if you don't know C in advance. But I could get A without knowing C before taking this class, so you don't need to be too scared unless you even haven't never done any coding.\n\nThe former half of lectures are really well tied to programming projects and I loved it. There are 3 projects and all required C programming. I expected this class is for OS internal and it is partly correct but it spends much time on concurrency problem (a process and a thread) while it is still very fun.\n\nI felt the latter half of lectures are bit dry, and because we don't have hands-on experience on them (memory management, file structure, spin-lock, hardware related subjects, and memory sharing) through projects, it was bit difficult for me to understand and absorb all of what I was taught.\n\n20 hrs / week is just average and I always tried to complete a project as soon as possible, so after a project is open, I spent 70-80 hrs / week and after I completed it, I go back to lectures and spent 10-15 hrs /week. I recommend the same way if you don't want to be upset at the last moment...\n\nExams were not so easy, you should expect they are more complicated than sample problems. However they kindly offer a check list you should review before each exam, so by checking all of them, going through all quiz on lectures and sample problems, I think you can be ready for tests.\n\nAnd if you want A, you should definitely try to get all extra credits. This class offers a lot of extra points. I'd recommend visit the Slack channel if you get stuck on projects. TAs are more responsive on Slack. This is a good course for those who wanted to know about kernel, thread, memory allocations. The first project is very frustrating because not only you need a solid knowledge in C programming (like pointer) but you also need to memorize and understand the syntax. (missing asterisk, mismatch variables). The project feels like a quest to debug rather than learning and building. I finished C programming from Lynda but still at lost. Ended up dropping the class. Probably worth mentioning that the professor is moving the pointers a lot in the videos which is very distracting when you're trying to see the content. The course itself wasn't too terribly hard. The instructor does a fantastic job of relating the concepts, is VERY active on the forums, and generally cares about you learning something - any one of these things are very admirable in a professor, as most professors usually have only one of them. She is also very generous with the curve, which is somewhat necessary as both midterm and final contain many GOTCHAS!\n\nThat said... the projects are an absolute bear - they are in C (not the friendliest of languages) and have 'extra' requirements that are time consuming to implement and have no relevance to the topics at hand. Project 1 is by far the most time consuming, so keep that in mind if you are struggling through the first one. We were basically given a blank C file to start - although I have heard this may have recently changed. \n\nIts a good course, but set aside a massive amount of time and take excellent notes. Also, learn at least the basics of C first - otherwise, you are toast! A very good introduction to Operating Systems concepts, most specifically Multi-threading, Synchronization, Inter process communication, and Distributed systems.  What an amazing course! I had a weak background in the topic and programming in C, so it was difficult for me. I spent quite a bit of time each week but I learned a ton.\n\nThe lectures are put together very well, and the professor and TA's are extremely engaging. Questions on Piazza are answered very quickly and there was a separate Slack group run by some of the TA's. When you get stuck, it feels like there is always help available.\n\nThe exams are difficult but fair. They mainly consist of thoughtful multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank calculations. The one downside is that the exams account for a very large portion of your final grade.\n\nThe projects were fun and they were run very well. The instructions are overall pretty clear and you are able to submit code to Bonnie for testing, so you have a good idea how well you did before it's even officially graded. There were extra credit opportunities for every project.\n\nThis course is thoughtfully designed and made for an excellent introduction to the program. I would recommend it to everyone. This is my first course of the OMSCS program, overall great learning experience. The course covers many OS topics with focuses on design and implementation of concurrency system, i. e. , CPU, memory, IO and file systems. I would say the course is well prepared and taught, the lecture is organized, the teachers and TAs are engaged, and the piazza discussion is very active and fun (well, it could also be discouraging, when you see your classmates are way far ahead of you into the project works). \n\nI am not sure if the project assignment is my favorite part of the course, but it is definitely where I learn the most. I am not a programmer but as a PhD in electrical engineering, I do have quite some experience in programming (not C unfortunately). However, I did have a hard time with C. This is mostlikely the reason that most of people dropped the course, ~ 40% according to the unofficial survey. On the other hand, I do see there are a lot of students who are professional software developers, these are usually the people who do the project much faster and lead the conversion on piazza. (I looked at the more than 15 LinkedIn profile of the students who are active on piazza). I was a teacher before, I know how challenging it is to design a project assignment given heterogeneous background and skill sets of students. I suggest to add more exercises or provide more code for the early projects to cut the steep curving curve. Most of people's feedback is \"I thought I know how to program in C until I started CS8803 Intro OS\". \n\nThe content of the course is really straightforward, i would rate the difficulty for the course content 3. However, the programming assignments are substantially more difficult for those who are not experienced with C. I rate it 4. 2. Given the fact that project assignment takes about 3 times more time than the course content, the weighted difficulty is 3. 9. \n\nThank you Ada and also the TA s for the fantastic course.  This was a really enjoyable class - don't let the 'introduction' fool you though, it's not easy. The course covers a good breadth and depth of operating systems - scheduling, memory management, concurrency, and then an overview of distributed memory and filesystems.  Very interesting topics. Very interesting programming assignments.  Great class. I learned a lot from the projects and the lectures were clear and well planned. \nDefinitely get started on the projects early and having some knowledge of C is a must. It's possible to learn C as you go, but your weekly workload will be substantially larger and honestly, you already have enough to learn in the class.\nI felt like the grading breakdown was fair, with ~50% projects and ~50% tests. There are extra credit opportunities.\nThe professor and TA's are all very active on piazza and slack; probably one of the most active in the courses I have taken so far. This is great because questions get answered very quickly.\nThere are 4 projects, with one of them being extra credit only. I would say all 3 projects require substantial time, with project 1 being the most work. Be prepared to spend at least 30-40 hours to do project 1 or project 2.  This course covers a vast set of topics in a short amount of time. The projects are narrow in focus however. Although the lectures are excellent, I felt that the course would have been more effective if the course creators focused more on depth rather than breadth. Perhaps assign more projects, get rid of the midterm, and replace about 40% of the lectures with more in depth information about the other 60%. Also grading of the projects is extremely slow. Grades for two of the 3 projects are unknown even after taking the final. This was my first OMSCS course. I come from a mechanical engineering background, with only done 1 C project over a year ago during my senior year embedded computing class and capstone project. I've done some self-studying and programming at work, so not completely disconnected from the programming world. \n\nI knew that I would struggle a bit to understand and relearn C so I gave myself extra time to do the projects (START EARLY) and stay consistent with a strict schedule. With a full time job and no kids, this class was my life for these few months.\n\nOne key thing I struggled with in the beginning was to set up your environment. They say there are a bunch of ways to do it and you can do it however you would like, but from a beginner's perspective and not knowing anything about how to set up an environment, I would have appreciated it if they had ONE default suggestion. After a week or two of struggling to get a proper environment set up, I finally found a working environment. I used VM VirtualBox to install Ubuntu (which they should have instructions/find instructions on internet), then for IDE in Ubuntu I used VisualStudio Code. This IDE was great because I figured out how to do debugging (there is a youtube video on debugging with VSC in Ubuntu), and you can debug with multiple VSC windows, essentially stepping through multiple interacting programs (debugging client AND server at the same time).\n\nA tip is to be active on the Slack channel. It can be difficult to keep up with all the activity going on, but if you put in the time and effort, you can sometimes gain some really helpful pointers and tips. That is why it is recommended to really start early and find your problems/roadblocks early, and you can be on the lookout for a solution in the Slack channel. To get the most out of the Slack channel, I learned that you need to be very precise with the wording of your questions and try your best to communicate that through text. That will allow the TA's or students to better help  answer your questions. Don't be afraid to ask your questions, but be specific and think about how to phrase it in a way for other people to understand (explaining code and technical stuff through text can be very confusing and difficult).\n\nAnother tip is try to meet up with students locally. Having someone to talk to and discuss project ideas and course concepts is VERY helpful. Of course please beware of plagiarism and misconduct according to the course rules.\n\nProjects were absolutely great! Coming from someone with very little C programming experience, I had so much to gain. Of course they might change the project contents every semester, but our semester it was fair amount of work with the given time. The first project was the most daunting because everything was so foreign to me. The VM, which IDE to use, how to debug, socket programming (concepts I've never done nor was it taught in the videos); it was overwhelming at first... so START EARLY. Project 3 was by far the most fun (get a whiteboard) with the design aspect. Project 4 was the most difficult to wrap your head around, but once you figure it out, you will say: \"What that's it?...\"\n\nIf you finish the projects and pass all the automated tests with a decent readme, you should be able to get 100 on the projects. I did right at average for the midterm, and a little below average on the final (disappointed with my performance), but I surprisingly got an A in the course!\n\nAll in all, in my opinion this was a perfect first OMSCS course. It will definitely not be easy, but if you put the time and hard work in, you shall be rewarded! Professor is great. TAs were responsive and helpful. The lectures are packed and engaging and you are tested mainly on the content of those and the research papers. The projects were rough for me and it took me a very long time to get through them. I think the reason for this is that I come from a scripting language background. I spent a lot of time floundering with C, but the TAs and other students are helpful. The projects themselves are well defined, interesting, and fun. I learned a whole lot form this class and I recommend to anyone who is at least somewhat familiar with the basics of computer architecture. If you, like me, are not practiced in C, start the first assignment as soon as possible to see if this class is doable. I read \"The C programming Language\" as preparation for this course. It was not enough. The better your understanding of C,  the fewer late nights you will have and the more you will enjoy this well organized, well communicated, interesting course.  Overall: I think this course should be mandatory for those of us without a CS bachelor's degree. I learned a ton about how computers actually work, and even though I am a front-end Javascript developer, a lot of the stuff I learned somehow kept coming up at work. Now that I've finally finished, I really want to go back over everything to solidify my knowledge. I would recommend this course to everyone, regardless of specialization. \n\nPrerequisites: I wish I had spent more time preparing for this course by learning C better, and doing the 'C for programmers' course on Udacity. I'd also recommend going through the free online book 'OS: Three Easy Steps' (it's pretty short, and there are exercises that go along with it). If you do this, I think you'll get a lot more out of the course. \n\nLectures: With a couple of exceptions, the videos are good but can be pretty abstract. The most enjoyable lectures were the ones that tied into the projects very obviously. You can get away with only watching the videos, but for a fuller understanding you will need to read the recommended textbooks and do a fair bit of googling. \n\nProjects (40% of your grade): I found the first project very difficult indeed, and I think this is one of the reasons why this class has such a high dropout percentage. However, if you can mash your way through project 1, then you should be able to get to the end of the course with a good grade, as projects 2 and 4 are much easier. Project 3 required a few late nights too, but at this point you should be better at C. Start early on P1 and P3, and do not underestimate them. \n\nExams (55% of your grade): The two exams (midterm and final) are short, and while I found the midterm relatively easy, the final exam covered a lot more material and was acknowledged by most of us to be pretty difficult. If you follow along with the recommended schedule (which I didn't), you should be fine. \n\nSlack/Piazza (5% of your grade): Very active/helpful TAs and professor. Took this course as my first course in the program, and it was a great choice. It is a very well organized and well run course, and I learned a lot. I came into the program with no CS background, minimal programming background, and zero experience with C, so the first few weeks of the class I was working probably 30-40 hours/week on the project, but it was manageable as I had few other commitments at the time. \n\nIf you can get past the first project you're definitely over the hump, the other projects were a bit easier. The course is also fairly generously curved, I ended up getting an A when I thought I was solidly in the B range. Overall, I would highly recommend this course as it is well run by both the professor and the TAs, and you learn a lot. This was my first class in the OMSCS program and by far this was the best class I have taken during my formal CS education. I did get an A in the course for some perspective. The course is made up of 4 projects, a midterm, final, and class participation on Piazza. The lectures are great and easy to follow. I highly recommend watching them on at least 1. 25x speed. I started doing this halfway through the semester (eventually bumped up to 1. 5x when re-watching) and realized I could retain a lot more info than having to keep rewinding because my mind was drifting. Only a handful of papers to read, most were pretty dated but helped drive some concepts home. If you are looking for an easy class though, this is not for you. I feel this has prepared me well for the workload/work ethic necessary to succeed in classes to come. You get out what you put in!\n\nAlso 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' is a free online book that I referenced A LOT to give me an intro into the topics discussed in the lectures. Chapters are short and easy to read/comprehend. Highly recommend it!\n\nFull Details:\nThe projects are, as mentioned everywhere else, difficult and clarification of parts are necessary. I would recommend being comfortable with at least the basics of C (pointers, func pointers, extern usage, getopts, string parsing, file manipulation, etc. ). For some that might be too basic but if you know how to read through the provided code then you should be okay to at least get through the simpler portions of the projects. You will want to start looking into the basics of socket communication, posix threading library, posix/sysv IPC mechanisms and synchronization. You will be provided enough material to get you going with each of the items listed in the last sentence. \n\nThe midterm and final are not easy and it is not enough to \"memorize\" formulas/concepts. You will need to understand the purpose and how each input to the problems/equations affect the output and then formulate what pieces are necessary to come to the correct answer. You will really have to understand the material. That said it is possible to do well. Participating in Piazza discussions, re-watching lectures, and doing the projects will prepare you well in understanding the concepts/problems on the exam. \n\nOne thing you might not expect is that you are provided an Ubuntu VM that is set up to test your projects in before trying the auto-grader in Udacity. Valgrind and GDB will be your best friend and help you find things that the auto-grader will detect and fail your submission even though things in the VM work fine. I would recommend some sort of version control too (I used git)! Excellent class, definitely one of my favorites so far! Projects were challenging and the exams were difficult, but I felt like I learned a ton. The TAs were great and very involved on Slack. Would definitely take again.\n\nIf you're thinking of taking this course:\n1. Be comfortable coding in C\n2. Start projects early -- they take a lot of time to complete!\n3. Watch and rewatch all of the lectures Professor and TA's were excellent. The lectures are very polished and intuitive. Programming projects can be very time consuming (especially the first project). Start projects early. Exams are medium difficulty. They follow the lectures pretty closely but require good understanding of the material. I watched every lecture again in the week or so leading up to the exam to refresh everything. Without doing that, I think the exams would have been much harder. There is a generous curve (80+ was an A in our class). \n\nThe programming projects are all in C, so if you are not familiar with C, it would be a good idea to take a refresher. If you are not a strong programmer, you will really struggle with the projects. I had very little C experience, but did my undergrad in CS and have been a software engineer for about 5 years and the first programming project probably took me about 50 hours to complete.  Great course overall. Videos are structured very well. TA's very responsive and helpful. First project was fairly hard. I think it was the learning curve for C and OS-style programming. Slack channel was very active!\n\n This is a great class. The target student is someone who has an OS course as an undergrad, but a while ago (or someone who wasn't CS undergrad). You will learn new things, even if you've developed low-level code before. The projects are moderately challenging. You need to be comfortable coding in C, the language of Operating Systems. People who don't know C find the projects incredibly hard. \nThe Professor and TA's are very active on Piazza, and go the extra mile to help out students who are stuck.  I would say its hard but grading seems to be a little tight.. Really need to count your marks from the very first assignment. Course until mid semester is programming oriented and after mid-semester is information oriented. It is really difficult to get the assignments/projects right, if you are not well versed in C. Definitely a worth-taking if one is not from computer science.  I will compare this class to Intro to HPC since it's the only other class I have taken. \n\nCompared to HPC this class was way easier. The gotcha here is that the testing style is not my favorite to be sure. It's multiple guess multiple select for the majority of the questions. I also thought it was trying to be tricky on some of the questions just for the sake of trying to increase the difficulty level. There was a ton of information to study for the final and I feel the test with only 15 question did not sufficiently test that material. Instead it was written too narrow and specific with too many gotchas. The programming assignments did take a while to accomplish but compared to HPC it was way easier (orders of magnitude easier). The bulk of the time I spent on the programming part was testing my code against a black-box auto grader.  Intro to OS is both a challenging and rewarding course \n\nThe assignments all require some research to complete, and they require a good understanding of how C works, most notably pointers, strings, and structs. Even though the assignments were all challenging, the TAs and other students were all very active and helpful on slack and piazza. You can submit the projects as many times as you would like before the deadline, and there are automated tests written for each project that give you immediate feedback on each submission. The projects deal with topics such as synchronization, multithreading, remote procedure calls, and different forms of interprocess communication. There are also often a few extra credit points you can get on most assignments, but usually you need to be to complete the main part of the project before attempting the extra credit. \n\nThere are only two exams: the midterm and the final, and they both cover a lot of material and are worth a pretty large percentage of your grade. Even if you remember all of the material, you have to be able to understand it and apply it in new ways on the exam. The questions are either multiple choice, check all that apply, or fill in the blank. I recommend taking thorough notes while watching the lectures to prepare and asking questions on slack or piazza when you need clarification. \n\nTo succeed in this course, I recommend not procrastinating, especially on projects 1 and 3, and once again taking good notes on the lecture material. Stay active on slack and piazza. Also, it is helpful to get some practice with C before starting. Though this course has a lot of assigments in C, the best part of this course is getting to read all the seminal papers, that pretty much introduced what is mainstream in most of the operating system. Exams and assignments were well managed. Great class and great introduction to the OMSCS program for me. I came in without much background in C and found the projects(especially the first one) to be hard. If you know C well then you won't have this problem. I spent a significant amount of time catching up on C. The class material was not that complicated. The instructor is very clear in her explanations and was present almost every week during office hours. One of the best things about this class was the slack channel and the TAs on there. They were very active as were the fellow students and it was fun discussing projects. The class is very well run and I highly recommend it to anyone. Ended up with an A. Overall this is a great class. Pros: * Interesting projects * Excellent Lectures * Impeccable pacing: the lessons, readings, and projects are timed perfectly. I routinely get everything done just in time. I don't feel like there's a time crunch or downtime * Given my background as a CS grad a little over 10 years ago, this class has a great balance of reviewing just enough undergrad information to prepare you for the challenges it introduces * Professor Ada is particularly responsive and helpful in the piazza forums. Cons (basically all of them are about organization, and indicative of a first-run of the class. they're sure to improve. ) * Grading is slow * The exams seem to need a little work in their wording and alignment with class material. There were many discussions of confusion in the piazza forums after the midterm and one of the midterm questions had to be regraded * If you've never done any C before, you're going to have a huge learning curve on the first project. A brief intro to C concepts optional lecture could go a long way here. * This class used ProctorU. Ugh.  Overall, this is a great class. The topics are interesting, the professor is very engaging in piazza and the lectures are well made. With that said, the projects are veeery time consuming if you dont have a deep understanding of C. The projects consist of a page or 2 of descriptions and the expected requirements and thats it. Its up to the student to figure out how to put everything together. If you are proficient in C, this class will be a breeze. If not, make sure you brush up on your skills and have alot of extra free time.  I really enjoyed this class and highly recommend it. Its probably my favorite class taken so far. Yes, there will be coding and yes, it is in C. But its totally doable and a lot of fun. There are four projects (three of them coding, one is an easy report that you can complete over a weekend). I had very limited experience in C (just from college many years ago) and I mainly use higher level languages like Java, C#, JavaScript and Python at work so diving back into C was a little bit of a challenge. But its very doable, do not get scared just because its C and it has pointers and manual memory allocations. You will be fine. Start your projects early and use the Piazza forums. The students are super helpful and there are always active discussions talking about common bugs or sharing online resources. Use the provided VM! Do not try to write and run programs in your own setup! Its not worth it and will only lead to headache. When you start the projects, break them down into bite size chunks. The projects themselves are fairly large (all of your time will be spent here) but if you set small milestones/goals you will complete the projects in no time.  Don't kid yourself - if you don't know C this class will make you work. You will struggle (enjoy lots of time with) with the projects, even more so if you come from a higher level background. Midterm & Final together are over half the grade, and 4 projects make up the rest. Though the course work has been difficult, grading has been fair. Content is interesting and presented well in the lectures. Overall class administration has been relatively poor, but that is probably a function of being a first time offering for the Professor.  First offering of this course. Prof and TAs quickly adjusted to feedback. All were very responsive. Projects require moderate C programming experience and time to learn new techniques (for me). Exams were challenging but unlike otjhers I ddid not feel that meorization was key - rather - picking out the fundamental principles and being able to reason about exam problems using those principles would be just as effective (if not more so) in doing weel on exams. The class member's feedback and help on Piazza made a huge difference in my success.  Great lectures, very hard assignments. Learn C if you don't know it before this course. Exams are relatively easy, come straight from the lectures.  Instructor and TAs have been outstanding. They are responsive on the forums, encouraging when students are in panic mode, and patiently responsive to criticism of content / organization. Really impressed with them. The relationship has felt surprisingly personal. Hopefully that persists beyond their first semester. \n\nThe projects can be very time consuming. I echo that you need to know C. Some specific C skills you'll need and are expected to have for Project 1 are the following:\n\n - string manipulation (i. e. , strcpy, strcat, strtok) and understanding/using null-terminated strings\n - use of pointers; nothing too complex like pointer arithmetic, but knowing how to initialize them, malloc space for them, derefence a pointer, and use the address of a variable as a pointer reference\n - general memory functions like malloc, free, memset -- this might be challenging if you've only used more abstract languages like Java and C#; took a while for me to wrap my head around it\n - file I/O: binary read/write, reading a file size (lseek) \n - using proper header files for prototyping (. h files) and (in later projects) incorporating provided. h files to implement APIs\n - creating a basic Makefile to build your application (though after Project 1 they started providing these)\n - creating a queue (linked list) structure and the functions needed to queue and dequeue items in an instance of that structure (again, after Project 1 they provided a library for this; not sure if future iterations of the class would go ahead and throw that in as a resource for the first project)\n\nYou're expected to be able to do the above with only the most basic and standard C libraries. We were allowed to ask if we could use a certain library to complete parts of our projects, but to my knowledge none of the small handful of requests were approved. But once C starts clicking and you get a handle on the basics, you don't really need any special libraries. \n\nThere's also a brief overview early on of how to create a basic web server and web client that communicate over a socket, which you'll have to implement and expand on (every project is a client/server combination). I found it to be a little too basic, but I was also struggling to get my C legs (get it?). I'd recommend that if you're a C noob, you also find a good introduction to connecting to, sending, and receiving over a socket. The first project requires that as part of its functionality, but while there's a lot more to it than that, I found it to be one of the most time-consuming portions. \n\nIf that seems overwhelming, I can say that I started the course with no previous C experience. I had primarily done C# and Java coding prior to taking this class, and I was able to get up to speed. If you have decent coding experience, you'll be fine. You'll just learn how much you take for granted. :) \n\nAs far as the material/exams go, I found that to be very easy to handle. The lectures aren't terribly long, they build on each other well, and (bonus!) they include a lot of fun graphics. I had no former exposure to most of the lesson topics, and I found the majority of the material very accessible. \n\nOh! A lot of people used valgrind and gdb for debugging, as well.  The professor is very involved in the class and you can learn a lot. Assignments do require knowledge of C and can be time consuming but you should do well if you have enough time to put into them. I found the exams to be the most difficult part of the class. The midterm and final are 55% of your grade. The material is not particularly difficult and questions come from the lectures but rely heavily on memorization of details that could be easily looked up (so you have to put a lot of time into memorization) and it can be difficult to understand the questions (with the question being open to interpretation). Grading is generous.  I took this course with very little C programming experience.  The first project had a significant learning curve for me in all aspects.  The first two projects were 60+ hr  of work each for me.  I did well on the third because it was easier and also am more comfortable C.  I'm guessing a student with a C programming background could complete the projects in a quarter the time I spent.  It did take significant effort up front to understand the requirements of the projects.  You can do this class without C in you skillset, but you will spend 10+ hours a week the first half of the course catching up on it because the projects require it.  Working full time, tackling this course material, teaching myself C, and another class on top of that was not the best idea.  \n\nThe professor, TAs, and Piazza/slack community were great in getting assistance with the projects and answering questions. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are well presented and organized.  Due to my efforts catching up on C and taking another class, I did not get to dive into the material as much as I would have liked.  One thing that I wish the class provided was more assignments related to the readings.  Whether essay or simple quizzes, I think it would help students take more from this material to have it tested in more than just the two exams.  Only half the readings relate at all to the projects.  No textbook required, but you should have some OS programming reference material handy.\n\nOverall very worthwhile course but A LOT of work if you don't know C!\n\nsemi-pro tip: Set up and get comfortable with an IDE ( I used VS code, many used CLion) the first week or prior to taking the class.  You will need it! A great course, with a great pro-active instructor and TAs who are very engaged with students (whether replying to Piazza posts or holding weekly office hours). \nThe grading is generous (everything graded out of 100 points and finally weighed in). You better know C cause 3 of the 4 course projects are mainly C programming projects. The projects will take significant time to complete.  Overall, this class was really well ran. Appreciated the active TA community and that Ada was present / hosted most of the office hours. The number one thing I would suggest (like many) is to start the projects early. I didn't do that for the second project and greatly regretted it.\n\nThe projects were my favorite part of class but also can be extremely time consuming, knowing C is very helpful and suggested on class pre-reqs. The tests weren't cumulative and were written fairly. But keep in mind the second half of class had considerably more content than the first.\n\nOverall, great class and glad it was my first in the program. Coming into the course I had about 4 years of professional development experience, mostly in C# and Python, but also some experience in C in undergrad and some professionally (programming micro-controllers). I don't have a CS degree so had never taken an OS course. This was also my first course in the program. \n\nThe class is extremely well run. The TAs are very active and helpful, and both Piazza and Slack are active and great resources. The lectures are thorough, well done, interesting, and generally translate well to the material needed for the exams. The projects (with the possible exception of project 2) are well done and very helpful to understanding concepts. \n\nThe style of the exams was multiple-guess and fill in the blank, timed, proctored (ProctorTrack), taken through T-Square. The questions needed some improvement, though. Some of the questions are a bit nit-picky, and some are written in such a way that I spent more time debating the intent of the question than figuring out the answer. \n\nAs for workload, the projects consumed most of the time I spent on the course. When I was working on a project I might spend 20+ hours a week on the class. Otherwise it was less than 10. To be successful on the projects I'd recommend starting early, being comfortable writing C in a \nLinux environment, using the command line, and debugging with GDB. \n\nLast, don't cheat. One of the TAs mentioned that they caught something like 10% of our class cheating on the projects. That's ridiculous. Start early, keep at it, and hit the Slack channel when you get stuck. You can survive a bad grade on a project but a course F due to cheating might end your time in the program. Don't be dumb. If you have a background in C, take it, take it, take it. Enough said. If you don't, you'll probably struggle. This is my first exposure to a OMSCS class. I would consider myself pretty well versed in C before the class and had some working knowledge of many operating systems mechanisms through using vendor OSs for embedded DSP chips which also lends itself to a decent understanding of computer architecture. \n\nOne of the best features of the class is the slack channel which one of the TAs has generously fronted the cost for. I  saved myself many hours just by doing some cursory scanning of the issues that others were running into on their projects. The TAs that were active in the slack channel were generally helpful as well.\n\nI feel overall the course was paced very well with ample time to do projects (assuming you don't procrastinate too much). Personally, I feel the exams aren't that great probably because they need to resort to a lot of multiple choice, true-false in order for the tests to be gradable. There was an extra credit project for up to 4% of your grade which was graded if you were near a grade border line. Overall, it seems that the curve is extremely generous (it's extremely easy to get a B). It would almost be more correct to call this \"Intro to Concurrent Programming in Linux\" or \"Programming at the User/Kernel Interface\" since the main focus of the course is on concurrency primitives (threads, mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, etc. ) and coding against Linux syscalls. You won't come out of this class writing a basic OS kernel or anything like that. \n\nWhat you *will* gain from this course is an appreciation for how userspace and the OS kernel interact, and a new appreciation for how much complexity is abstracted out by modern APIs that you don't have to deal with. \n\nIf you're already comfortable programming in C, you shouldn't have too much trouble with this class. If you're not, you probably will. The exams (midterm and final) are straightforward but can be a bit picky (i.e. a complicated multi-step calculation that Ada works through in the lecture videos in its entirety, but that you must reproduce on the exam without references), but the course is generous about grade cutoffs (>= 80 == A seems to be the standard) so even mediocre performance on them is not a blocker for earning a good grade in the course. Coming from a background in high-level web development (and, earlier, scientific computing), this course taught me a very different style of programming. It's taken a bit of effort to get used to the concepts in the course and I've really enjoyed the struggle. The projects are, for the most part, detailed, relevant, and instructive. \n\nThe lectures, on the other hand, are long, tedious, and often off-topic. The instructor spends excessive time and effort explaining simple (or easily-researched) topics and leaves large conceptual blocks unexplained. She does this in lectures that are often over three hours in length. The in-lecture exercises are completely unrelated to the course material. \n\nThe midterm exam was closed-book using ProctorTrack (which is terrible software based on a bad idea, but with excellent customer support) and largely memorization-based. The exam format stressed me out more than its difficulty. \n\ntl;dr The topics are neat, but the course is badly formatted.  This course was very challenging for me because I did not have any prior experience with C (despite all of the warnings). If you already know C, then you're probably fine and this might even be alright to take as a first course. I would definitely not recommend following the approach that I did though by thinking I could pick up C on the fly; as far as I can tell, I spent *way* more time on the projects than most of my peers, and most of that time I was way out in left field anyway. If you're _still_ determined to take this course without knowing C first (hey I get it, I was stubborn too), then do yourself a favor and go pick up a copy of [The Linux Programming Interface](http://man7.org/tlpi/) (I found one pretty cheap at a local used books store) right now, because it'll be your lifesaver for the first few projects.\n\nThat said, even though I really struggled with the programming assignments, I still really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot from it. The lectures are great: clear and easy to follow; the professor actually does office hours every week and goes over some great and useful stuff; the TAs are super helpful (and a pretty funny and entertaining bunch on Slack!); and all-in-all the course was very well organized. I am definitely going to miss this class! I'll start off with the fact I've been building enterprise-level server software for years, so the client-server programming assignments in C (where most people struggled) weren't too bad. Lectures were solid, based in the required papers or the optional recommended reading (OSTEP book as prep material is great if you're weak on OS concepts). Gavrilovska is a published OS researcher, so knows the material intimately. TAs were incredibly helpful on Piazza with quick replies and knowledgeable (Tony Mason completely rocked it). \n\nThe only complaint I would have is that the Udacity autograder was configured to execute code that was different from what we were provided to test in local VMs, so several times I found myself ripping my hair out trying to figure out why some client-server test was timing out on Udacity after 10s but completing in milliseconds on my local VM. It seems the TAs love to set up network partition errors for client-server tests. You know who you are... ;)\n\nOverall great course, got more in-depth OS knowledge than I came into it with, and feel like it was one of the best-organized courses I've taken so far (3rd in the program). It definitely makes me think twice about how I'm about to implement a multithreaded and/or multiprocessing solution.  this class requires a firm knowledge of C. If you haven't use or remember C this class is difficult. Only recommend if you know C. My second course in OMSCS. This was an extremely well run course. It's set my expectations very high for other classes. The professor was highly engaged on Piazza. The TAs were well organized and responsive. The projects overall were very good and well defined. I highly recommend this course.\n\nNow to the disclaimer! The projects are _hard_, like, if you don't know C at all, you are going to really struggle. So be prepared. I have experience in C, although rusty. The harder projects took me 20+ hours probably. Get started early on the projects and be prepared to spend a lot of time. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed them.\n\nThe exams were the usual closed book format - not my favorite thing in any class. Cram before taking, and you'll be okay. Project 2 was not included in fall 2017's syllabus. The other three projects had a steep time commitment and required knowledge in network programming and C. I probably spent 100+ hours on project 1, about 50+ hours on project 3, and about 20 hours on project 4. The two exams are proctored, tricky, and are worth more than half your grade. Most students did well on the projects but suffered severely on the exams due to the tricky questions. The class is curved, which makes up for the exams, but it would be better to reduce the trickiness of the exams and make the questions more straight forward so a curve wouldn't be so necessary. Generally a very good class. The material is presented well, and is very interesting. It definitely favors people that already are familiar with C and Unix. If you're not a strong programmer, you might be in for a surprise, as the assignments can be quite involved. \n\nThe TAs went far over and above the usual level of support, and did a great deal to make this class run smoothly. It wasn't perfect... they're using a somewhat new autograding system that had quite a few kinks. They worked out a lot of them, and it should be much better going forward.  This was a great course. The lecture material was extremely well made. The projects were hard, but rewarding. \n\nThe only major con I can come up with is the \"Udacity Autograder\" which was used to test the performance of the programming projects. It is designed to provide feedback when a test fails, but more often it would simply fail with no error message, leaving you scratching your head for hours about what went wrong. Fortunately, the Piazza class community was good at providing tips for how to \"debug in the autograder\". \n\nThis was the first course I have taken in OMSCS and frankly I was totally impressed. I would highly recommend this course. It's not easy, but you will learn a lot.  Great class, I didn't have much experience with C besides a Data Structures class in undergrad (15 years ago), but I still remembered how pointers worked. Projects didn't take much time to me, but I'm a somewhat experienced programmer.\n\nTop notch lectures, although I love the fact that there exists a transcription with screen captures for all of them. This was my second OMSCS course and by far one of the best courses I've taken at a university level.  I say best in term of the rich amount of material that's covered in the lectures and projects which further reinforce (THREE projects + 1 extra credit project offered but optional) the theory.  The class will require you to work very hard to complete the projects.  They give you starter code and a description of what's expected.  You will find yourself googling how to do things like setting up TCP sockets or using Shared Memory IPC etc.  A good background in C will help in this course as all the projects require using C language.  Slack and Piazza are good places to look for answers / ask when you are stuck; 7/10 times someone else has already asked the question.\n\nTo prepare for C, read and practice some examples on Arrays, Pointers (understand pointer arithmetic also), Structures, Function Pointers (used to do Callbacks), Dynamic memory allocation and freeing using malloc() and free().\n\nUbuntu operating system is used for the projects.  I used Virtual Box to run Ubuntu but perhaps my computer is sluggish and the VM was annoyingly sluggish.  I would recommend running it natively off of a partition if you can.   I have two monitors but could only use 1 with VirtualBox, I could look into enabling the 2nd monitor but I didn't even try considering how sluggish it already was.\n\nThe exams were challenging but fair.  If you go through all the lectures and understand the content and do the quiz examples and sample exam, you will be prepared for the exam.  It is a lot of content so do keep pace with the schedule while working on the projects.  I got through the class without buying the recommended books.\n\nThe course will get challenging and you might lose hope at times but keep going.  Here are sample scores from a previous semester and what grades it translated to with the curve.  I wish I had this information earlier in the semester:\n\nExample 1: Project 1 - 80 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 70%, Project 4 - 75%, Midterm - 90%, Final - 85% --> 87%, Participation - 5% (max) = A\n\nExample 2: Project 1 - 60 %, Project 2 - Optional, Project 3 - 45%, Project 4 - 50%, Midterm - 80%, Final - 75%, Participation - 2% --> 65% = B\n\nProfessor Ada is passionate about this course and going above and beyond to help students.  She holds a weekly session going over project and class questions.  This was very helpful.  I did not pay much attention to this till half way through the semester.  It really does help understand the project requirements.  The TA's are also helpful in answering question in Piazza and Slack.\n\nIt was a lot of work but I'm glad I took this class.  It really makes you appreciate what the Operating System does behind the scene.  Even if you don't do Systems level programming in your career, you will have a stronger foundation in computing.  Best of luck if you take this class! Spring 2015 is the first time they offer this course so there are lots of rough edges. \n\nThe good part - lectures are very detailed and complete. \nTips if you download the video to watch offline, remember to go to udacity to complete the quizzes, \nit counts towards 5% of the participation grade. \n\nThe ok part - this is an intro class and lots of people are in it. Piazza has lots of posts to go through. \nAlso prof expect you to contribute in the forum (participation grade). The projects are not very refined. \nYou should know C for project1, 3, 4. \n\nThe bad part - they don't provide feedback to your projects. \nSadly they cannot afford to do so because of the class size. \nBut you cannot learn from your mistake so you don't know what you did wrong. \n\nExams not that useful in testing how much your learn. You need to memorize a lot of details in order to do well.  A great, great class. The amount of work wll vary widely based on your background. I took this class because I didn't feel confident walking directly into AOS and I certainly feel it prepared me well for it. If you are not comfortable writing C, the projects will be very time-consuming. I often fell behind on lectures due the amount of time working on projects, and couldn't have imagined taking IOS alongside another class (while working). The lectures are dense but I wouldn't say difficult to grasp, and the exams stick to them quite closely. One qualm is that exam questions are sometimes worded strangely, making them more perplexing than they need to be. A highlight was the class forum: my class had some brilliant student contributors alongside the TAs and prof actively involved. That really made the difference while working through projects.  This is an excellent class. Conceptually not difficult to understand but it was very very time consuming for me since I had to come upto speed on C and I am not a programmer but do have good knowledge of general programming concepts. This class gives you a broad understanding about linux OS but does get into detailed discussions about multithreading and multiprocessor systems. I do agree with others here that the project descriptions are not very well defined but the office hours really helped in better understanding of what was required. Piazza was exploding with information and discussions with high level of participation from students, TAs and professor Ada. Infact I believe it was piazza discussions that really helped me with the projects. Knowing atleast a bit of C, functions and pointers in C and creating a robust linked list program prior to the course will be very useful. The linked list that I created for project 1, I reused it for project 3. The classes were very well organized and lots of effort and thought has been put into organizing this class. Really very rewarding and a blissful experience. This is my first semester and I really hope the remaining OMSCS is atleast or better than this class in terms of class organization.  The is an excellent class with an exceptional instructor. I didn't have much C going in, so it took a lot for me to complete the projects. Detailed feedback on the projects is provided but only if you ask. While this was the first time this class was offered, it was incredible and it set a high bar in both quality and content. I do recommend you take it by itself: there is a lot of material, and the tests and projects are challenging. However, Prof. Ada is very involved and I would very likely take another class from her.  WORKLOAD:\nThis class consists of lecture videos, two exams (midterm+final), one \"quiz\"-type project, and three C-programming projects. The programming projects are based on 1) socket programming, general C, and multithreading, 2) IPC, and 3) RPC. The first two projects were sizable endeavors, and the third was much less intense. I had very little general programming experience (no industry experience, some C++ in undergrad, and some Python scripting). The first two projects took me about 50-80 hours each, I'd wager. \n\nTESTS:\nThere is no required text for this course, and all you get for material are lecture videos and papers. So studying for tests consisted of watching videos over and over for me. The tests themselves are kind of vague, but they are achievable, and you will learn a lot studying for them, but I would like to see more concrete test questions with less subjectivity. One \"project\" was a take-home quiz, where you decide on test parameters for some fictitious experiments. This one was super vague, and I would have much rather actual ran experiments and written a paper. \n\nLECTURES:\nI don't know if this is true about all OMSCS videos, but she waves her hand a lot in front of the screen, which causes the text to be projected on her hand. Not a big deal, but I found this distracting. I ended up watching the lecture videos over and over, because that seemed to be the best way to pass the tests. Would rather have been pointed to more reading. \n\nOVERALL:\nMy first course in OMSCS. I think this class was great and was not too hard, even without much programming or OS experience coming in. You'll learn parallel programming, scheduling, file systems, memory management, IPC, Linux, systems programming, etc. You touch on some concrete Linux examples but I would have liked more. Overall a great class and a must take for the first semester. As all great things it did have its ups and downs.\n\nIn this class you will learn about: processes and process management, threads and concurrency, scheduling, memory management, inter process communication and various sync constructs, i/o, virtualization, remote procedure calls, distributed file systems, distributed shared memory, and some datacenter technologies.\n\nYou will get to implement a multithreaded getfile client/server, proxy, cache, and play with an RPC (this semester's was Sun's RPC) think how awesome all of these would look on your resume, also you'll be able to answer all of the AOS prereg question list https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/cs6210_diagnostic-preparedness-test.pdf. If your goal is to eventually take AOS, HPC, HPCA then this class would get you in great shape for them.\n\nThe lectures are great and require no outside readings to understand the material, professor Ada was very active on Piazza and held office hours regularly, and the TA's were friendly and very responsive on both Piazza and Slack. \n\nThe tricky part of the class were the exams, particularly the final which had more material than the midterm on it. So I suggest you study hard for it. There are some (few) papers to read through, but you can get through these fairly easy as there's few and concise.\n\nKEY to this class is to make sure you start the projects on time, the first project in particular is trickier than the others. The more time you spend on it and the better you do on this first project will be worth it in the long run. For each of the projects you have about 1 month to complete which is more than enough.\nI didn't do as good on this first project, because I started it very late, but managed to do good on the last two. So even if you don't do as good on the first one don't fret, you can still do great in the class!\n\nSome C will be good to know coming in, but I think that if you work hard you can pull it off with minimal knowledge, you just need to attack that first project really hard. If you're familiar with pointers, double pointers, function pointers, and using typedef and structs, then you're golden. If not then take the Lynda.com C classes (comes free for students) or grab the K&R C book and go through it (there's also a k&r c solutions book that can be bought for the solutions for the exercises) you can get those for under 20$ if you look hard enough, but just understanding the aforementioned will be enough and wouldn't take more than a few days of stack overflowing and testing on your own to get.\n\nMake sure you're on Slack since Day 1, you can learn a lot about the projects and get hints on them by lurking in the channels. This semester we had a PAID Slack workspace thanks to one of the TA's, how cool is that? To top it all this semester there were some pretty funny characters on it which made lurking enjoyable, however there's always the usual troll tho in there, but hey it's still a great resource.\n\nTL;DR: Just go for it; great class, doable/rewarding projects, friendly/active TA's, very active instructor, very C, such Threads, many Science, WOW. Ten weeks into the semester, I've spent 125 hours on IOS. Six of that was initially setting up the development environment (mostly because I had a new and unfamiliar hardware setup), 70 on the projects, 23 on Piazza, Slack, etc., and 26 hours watching video lectures. (I log my hours with Toggl. ) It turns out that I have a pretty good background for the coursework we've done so far (concurrency and IPC mechanisms). The next 5 weeks may prove to be a bit harder for me. \n\nThe TAs have been *very* engaged, and there's a lot of healthy discussion on Piazza and the OMSCS6200. slack. com channel, which has been fun. (That explains why I've spent 23 hours on it. ) The prof (Dr. Ada Gavrilovska Habl) has been very fair, and is an excellent lecturer. This is my first semester, so I don't have a basis for comparison, but I'm very pleased with this course, and I recommend it. \n\nProjects are individual and have been well-designed. Development is in C, which is entirely appropriate for an OS course. If you only know a scripting language such as JavaScript, R, or Python, you might want to hit the first project hard, right away, to climb that learning curve. This is my first class in the program and I really like it. The lectures and materials are clear and well organized. Piazza is super active. \n\nThe projects are the best part. The requirement can be vague and require serious interpretation and design before going into coding. They are challenging but not too difficult. I have never programmed in C before the class, but once I am familiar with C and get all the caveats of low level programming, the projects get a lot easier. There is auto grader so you get constant feedback and guarantee to get a decent grade. Project 1 is the most time consuming so far, so don't drop the class if you feel frustrated. It will get better. This class will definitely improve your programming skills. \n\nOverall, very high quality course. Good for a first class. Highly recommended.  Fantastically done class! The lectures were great - they used a very accessible metaphor (consistent through the whole class) to explain the different problems to be solved by the OS, and the different roles that OS components would fulfill. \n\nThe projects were challenging, but were presented with just enough guidance to be manageable. Each assignment used Bonnie for autograding, which was exposed to the students and was invaluable during testing. It makes an assignment much less stressful when you have a live view of your grade, before you submit the assignment! This was a great introduction to OS course.  I have no background in C and I have never taken an OS course before.  I tried to take this course over a year ago and ended up dropping it because I could not keep up.  This time around I prepared a couple months in advance by reading through Learn C the hard way and completing all of the C courses on Lynda.  \n\nUse the class Slack channel.  The TA's for this class are amazing and will always help you.  They don't give you answers but they can point you down the right path.  We had other students in the class with experience in some of the areas and they helped out in Piazza and in the Slack channel as well. Between the projects, TA's, and other students, there is a huge wealth of knowledge to gain in this class.  Then add on the papers and lectures and its almost too much.  \n\nThe TA's were very active on Piazza as well.  The instructor held weekly office hours to answer any questions about the projects, lectures, papers, or tests.\n\nProject 1 is really not that bad if you keep it simple, which is harder then it sounds when you're new to this subject.  Its easy to over think the problem and create a mess but the project is really pretty straight forward.  One of the main focuses of the project is multi threading.\n\nProject 2 was extra credit for us.  It had no programming but was a written assignment to design an experiment.\n\nProject 3 was the toughest.  It was a bit more free form in that you could design your program to work many different ways.  Its best to plan this project out before you start programming it.  I jumped right into programming and that was a mistake.  I still did very well on the project but I could have saved myself many hours if i would have designed before programming.  Shared memory and multi threading are some focuses here.\n\nProject 4 was the easiest.  Again its really straight forward but I can see it being another project that is easy to over think and make difficult for yourself.  This one dealt with RPC and multi threading.\n\nI found the mid term and final to be the most difficult part of the class.  You have to read all of the papers and watch all of the lectures and really understand the material in order to do well on the exams.  \n\nI stayed within the class average for the mid term and did very very bad on the final.  I got almost a 100 percent on the all the projects and did the extra credit.  Walked away with a B in the class.\n\nMy background is 1 year as system tech, 3 years of COBOL on a mainframe and almost 2 years now in Java doing full stack. You need to know C. Don't fool yourself thinking you can learn it in the first few weeks as may be suggested by the materials. If you don't understand pointers, referencing, dereferencing, data structures, etc you'll be in for a very rough ride. I 'thought' I knew C from my experience with Arudino work, but boy did I really have to play catch-up. Had I not had the Arduino experience before hand, I would likely have dropped. (A lot of people drop in the first two weeks due to poor C skills. Repeat you must already have some C experience !!)\n\nThe lectures are good and Ada know's her shit and does a good job of teaching it. I had almost no knowledge of how operating systems really worked until I took this class and now I have a much, much better understanding. I was taking this class just to fill electives, but it's one of those classes where I was surprised how much I learned (and how much I didn't know). I'm not planning on writing kernel software anytime soon, but the understanding you get from the class definitely helps even if what you mostly do is front or backend web dev stuff. \n\nAs with most other of the challenging course, start the assignments early. The forums move quickly, so if you fall behind your classmates on the programming schedule, your \"I'm just starting part A\" questions will get a lot less attention if everybody else has already moved on to Part C. If you stay up or ahead of the assignments, then the forums will greatly assist you. (My C got a lot better because I was able to stay in the general flow of the class. Had I fallen behind, I don't know that I would have made it. )\n\nSome of the later assignment build off of earlier ones, so design flaws can catch up with you later in the game. You're given very broad scope to design however you like and grading is through an API. I had a design flaw that I didn't understand that bit me on the last assignment in the extra credit sections. Nonetheless I got an A. The professor was excellent. She was very active in the forums and held Google Hangout office hours even while sick or travelling. The TAs were great too. For the first assignment, my TA did Google Hangout grading with each student, and I found it very helpful to get feedback in this way, and it allowed me to explain my decisions in ways I might not have otherwise. Unfortunately it was only for that assignment, as I'm guessing that it took too much time. \n\nThe programming assignments were practical and challenging enough without being overly difficult. Prior experience with C made them very manageable. \n\nI definitely got a lot out of this class.  First the good points. Professor Gavrilovska does a good job in lecturing the content. The examples are nice and she brings in some new topics relevant to the modern world (VM, Data Center technology, etc). Generally the course content was a rehash of the undergrad concepts and some new ones. Well balanced and I liked it.\nThe TAs were generally responding, not amazing but good. \nThe negative was the C projects. Whoever says whatever, you need good C and a nice understanding of pointers. I spent very long hours debugging code which I felt was not necessary for the course. I did not learning anything about the OS. I learned about advanced C Programming (which I am not sure was necessary as part of this course). The other thing I felt very arbitrary was the extra points for the project work. The instructions were not clear on what exactly would earn us the extra points. TAs used discretion which did not sit well with me (but again this is my opinion). The final exam was difficult but I was more disappointed with the quality. Some of the questions were ambiguous and not well laid out. I think Professor gave extra points for those questions. \nWill I recommend the course? Absolutely.  There were a lot of great things about this course and a few things that could use improvement.  The great things are the lectures are engaging, the assignments are relevant to industry, and the course staff was engaging on Slack and Piazza.  The things needing improvement I felt were the assignment count and one or two questions on the exams.    The first assignment and the third assignment were both rather difficult so you want to get a start on those as soon as you can. The fourth assignment was not as difficult so that was a great time to take advantage of the extra credit in the class. If you bomb the hard half of project 3 like I did, you're going to have a hard time bringing up your grade for the remainder of the course due to the lack of assignments .That's unfortunately enough to sink you with assignment 2 gone.   However, with the curve, its still rather attainable to get a B (I received a B).  The exams were rather difficult and tricky. Most of the questions were fine. I felt that one or two of the questions were cheap shots (obscure details in papers that aren't immediately obviously applicable to industry /historical ).  I went over the videos over and over again but honestly still didnt do very well here.  Definitely focus on understanding the details in the assigned papers and don't put the papers off until after the assignments were due like I did (this was a mistake).  All in all, this course wasn't that bad from a difficulty perspective for being a systems course. It'd probably be a good fit as a foundational class for you. It's a decently hard class, but not overwhelming. You just need to do the work. FWIW, I got an A, though it was curved upwards from a low B. I found the exams to be more difficult than the assignments personally, mostly due to the format. Sadly, I didn't do as well on them as I would have liked and feel I could have done better on them. My recommendation is to take detailed notes as you watch the lectures and read the papers. Especially take notes as you read the papers. Some of the material is a little dense, and the lectures can be sometimes circuitous. If you're watching the lectures through the web, you can set the speed to 1. 25x for the youtube player. You might find this helpful if you're having difficulty focusing on the lectures. \n\nI had professional programming experience but only a little bit in C. I found the programming part difficult only as I was becoming acquainted with the problem. After that, the assignments are very straightforward. Projects 1 and 3 are time consuming and will take 20-30 hours of your time. Projects 2 and 4 will only take 3-5 unless you do the extra credit. \n\nJudging by my interactions with other students, if you're going to take this class and are not comfortable programming, you should:\n- Learn how to work inside a VM. Learn how to set up a shared folder between the VM and your host machine in advance if you think you'll need it (you probably don't)\n- Learn enough C. The C programming in this course is not hard, but if you're not comfortable with the language's semantics you'll be overwhelmed on the first assignment. \n- Learn how to work in GCC, GDB, Make and Valgrind. There are plenty of great tutorials out there. \n\nMy only complaint is that the sample exams in Udacity didn't adequately prepare me for the real exams. Other than that, this course is excellent. Professor Ada and the TAs were super responsive. I don't recall ever having to wait more than 20-30 minutes for a response ever. I definitely recommend taking this course.  Projects were not terribly difficult. Built a good knowledge base on OS in this course. Definitely brush up on C skills. I program in C professionally, but many students really seemed to struggle with it. Once you're passed that hurdle the projects get much easier I would think. All in all pretty good course Great course... appropriate breadth and depth for this topic. Instructor is excellent, and the TAs did a good job as well. Like most OS courses, it's based on the \"C\" language so students would be well advised to refresh their existing skills or acquire a solid fundamental familiarity (e. g., syntax, pointers, etc. ) in advance because you will be using them right from the start of the first project assignment. The course will build upon them and explore subjects such as the various forms of IPC, concurrency, etc. The lectures in this course were good - interesting and explanatory without being pedantic, for the most part. The class projects were difficult even for a veteran ex C programmer, so prepare accordingly. I would have liked to have done more smaller projects rather than grind out old C memory allocation issues. Thankfully this semester's TA was an amazingly talented guy! The length of the programming assignments kept me from doing all the reading I would have liked in the OSTEP book. The assigned papers were weak: out-of-date material and just not interesting. The exams were exercises in minutia. Understanding the concepts is not enough. 15 questions for a final that's 30% of the grade? No.  This course was great. I had an uphill battle from the start not knowing C, but was able to learn it on the fly and complete all of the projects. The projects are challenging, but certainly not impossible. The TAs and the rest of the class are very active on Slack and Piazza. You almost always have someone to talk through problems, even very late at night. \n\nI feel like I learned the most from the projects. This is definitely a class where you'll have to dedicate some time to, but if you haven't taken an OS class or it's been a while, this is a great one to go through. Exquisite course. Lectures, projects and tests. Very good! Overall: This was my first class in the OMSCS program. Assignments are challenging but overall fun. Lectures are well prepared and easily understood. Had a hard time to understand questions in quizzes and exams, which led to anxiety throughout the semester. \n\nLectures: Very easy to understand and instructive. I learned a lot in this class. Definitely worth all the time you need to put in. \n\nProjects: This course is a lot better if you have a C/C++ background. In particular, you will need to understand how to allocate memory and pointers in general (i. e. pass-by-reference, etc. ). That being said, this class had the most challenging-but-fun projects that I have ever seen. You get to work with Linux at a very low-level. You also get lots of feedback and general help from the TAs so the projects should definitely help you get a good grade. \n\nExams and quizzes: I had a hard time understanding the questions and didn't do well overall. I had a lot of anxiety during the semester because I thought I would fail the class. In the end, I got a good grade so it's definitely doable. Programming projects\nYou'll see a lot of reviews complaining about all the C programming in this course. I assure you, as someone who had a couple of C-heavy courses in undergrad and no professional experience with the language, it is not that bad. They give you a ton of code and the assignments kind of write themselves once you get the hang of what they are after. Even so, you should probably expect to spend 20 to 30 hours on two of the four projects. Don't bother with the extra credit options on the projects unless you really want to. They will add quite a bit of additional time while only affecting your grade by about 1% each. \n\nLectures/Tests\nThe lectures are a little slow paced. I watched most of them on speed-and-a-half, which increased my focus considerably. The midterm and final ask detailed questions from the lectures and also contain quite a bit of application material. Strive for understanding of the lectures, rather than memorization, and you'll be fine. \n\nOverall comments\nI got an A in this class without having to sweat too much, mainly because the curve is generous - 81 to 100 was an A in fall 2015. It's an enjoyable class with some interesting material that I didn't encounter in undergrad. Biggest complaint: nothing got graded until the middle of the semester, because nothing was really due until then. The first project is already divided into four deliverables. Releasing separate grades for those components would help students who are unsure of where they stand.  This was my first class in the program and I absolutely loved it. Coming into this I was hoping for a solid introduction to OMSCS, computer science, and C and I would say that it was very successful on all fronts. I\u2019ve consolidated my thoughts / tips about the class below based on topic.\n\n#### Projects\n1. The project code always contains a base set of functionality which you enhance. PR1 for example gives you most of the code for a working C program, you just need to cover the business logic (creation/parsing of a GETFILE protocol message). \n2. TA\u2019s always provided the CMakelists file if you prefer to use CLion and that also makes things easier. \n3. _PR1 \u2013 GETFILE PROTOCOL_\n  1. I had very little C experience before this and I was a bit scared coming into the first project. Consequently, I began PR1 as soon as I could and finished about two weeks early. I spent a lot of time in the beginning establishing best practices for how to do things. It forced me to work slowly and do a ton of research on various C aspects, but by PR3-4 I was very confident in my C ability.  \n4. _PR2 \u2013 Extra credit research project_\n  2. I went above and beyond and did the experiments, which was not required. It took me about 4 hours to complete. \n5. _PR3 \u2013 Shared memory-based IPC_\n  1. This one was pretty easy for me. I completed it in about 6 hours total, including both parts.\n6. _PR4 \u2013 RPC_\n  1. This program is basically PR1 and PR3 where RPC abstracts all of the communication. It\u2019s pretty easy, but took me about 12 hours to complete because I stumbed on the MT section. \n\n#### Knowing C\n1. I was completely new to C coming into this and excited to get some exposure. The first project will force you to use strings. Working with strings in C can be challenging. If you're like me and eager to learn new lower level languages, this class is perfect for you. \n2. The other thing that was pretty complicated was the implementation of a thread pool. You don't have to do it like this, but in terms of performance its the best way. Once you get a working thread pool implementation, you can use it for subsequent projects in the class. \n\n####  Tests\n1. Test 1 \u2013 25% of your grade. I found it harder than the second exam. Median was a 76%.\n2. Test 2 \u2013 30% of your grade. IMO, it was easier than the first exam by a long shot. \n\n####\tTAs\n1. Overall, the TAs were highly responsive, but very shame based. I suppose it\u2019s an industry problem. The expectation is that you know the readme very well. Questions about well defined things on the readme or C related questions you can google will get you ridicule. Always try to find the answer on your own before you ask. \n\n####\tTips\n1. Use the study guide to study for the test. It seems obvious but, I studied everything I could get my hands on for the first test and felt like I made it much harder on myself. I found that other students were doing similar things. Since this is an introductory class, there are certain topics in which the rabbit hole goes deep. Make sure that you\u2019re studying the material as it relates to GIOS. \n2. I would strongly recommend using CLion. They make an IDE for every language used in the OMSCS program and its heavily used in the industry. I ended up installing this on my Ubuntu VM and using it from there.\n3. There is a slack for this class and I would recommend it. The TA\u2019s are very responsive. \n4. I would recommend the environment setup they use. I tried doing PR1 on my mac and had all sorts of problems. \n5. For debugging, there are a few tools which will make your life easier. I found these to be most helpful:\n  1. Telnet \u2013 must have for the first part to test your server before you finish the client\n  2. Wireshark \u2013 to confirm whether client or server is breaking\n  3. CLion debugger \u2013 self explanatory\n6. There is always a performance metric component to the test. These are based on the readings assigned during the semester. Know those very well, it\u2019s low hanging fruit on the exam. \n7. Execution flows are a big part of this class. If you don't understand the math, I strongly recommend that you draw out the flow. The questions on the test are usually small enough that you can draw them out to achieve the answer. This is what I did for test 1 and 2 and it worked out well. \n8. At the end of the class, they added a lot of material and I felt like the amount of time required increased per week. Take this into account after the midterm and stay on-top of your lectures. \n9. \tSome of the last readings are unnecessary and very long. The RPC reading, for example, is unnecessary, dense, and 40 pages long. Since it was not present on the study guide, I skipped reading it altogether and it paid off.  This class is fantastic - perhaps my favorite one so far. The videos are excellent, and it covers a ton of really fundamental topics. I think in my work, I've leveraged what I've learned in this class more than any other. The projects cover some really useful techniques for writing concurrent code. Highly recommended.  First, Professor Gavrilovska organized this course in a very straightforward and thorough way.  I don't think it could be better presented, given the scope of the material.  The class was a good introduction to a lot of OS concepts, and gave a decent survey of more modern concepts that many would consider to be application or domain-specific (e.g. data centers).  The material was lopsided in that the final part of the semester was much more in-depth than the beginning, and hence the final exam had many more pain-points of memorization than the midterm.  The projects were very illustrative of the concepts (I wish we'd had project 2, whatever that was) and didn't fall into the trap of being application-specific.  Strongly recommend C programming background, familiarization with GDB, and (probably) a solid understanding of the Linux filesystem and make paradigm.  As mentioned in other reviews, beware the details on the exams, and try your best to memorize graphs and charts as presented (they ended up being around 15-20% of the grade on the exams and are NOT re-presented as graphics during the exams).\n A good course to start the program with, I enjoyed the class a lot more than I expected. The lectures were good and the projects taught the concepts well. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. I saw many posts recommending familiarity with C prior to starting this course, but I don't think this level of caution is warranted. I think this course could serve as a good introduction to C as well as operating system fundamentals, and it's not that hard to get an A despite not having experience with C. \nMy background - technical undergraduate degree (non-CS, a little programming), web developer for 3 years using higher-level languages, and read 'The C Programming Language' as I was starting the course. \nExperience with the course - this course requires a decent time commitment, both for projects and for keeping up with lectures. Most weeks had 3-4 hours of video for lectures, and I worked steadily on projects every week, making sure I kept up with recommended benchmarks so I didn't fall behind. Not being familiar with C meant that I did a decent amount of googling for basics (and referring back to my book), and I also requested help [moderately] often from the slack channel. However, most of my problems were not strictly due to lack of language familiarity (the homeworks do not demand anything that complicated in terms of C) - more often I was confused about the concepts or made silly mistakes due to lack of confidence. The TA's are extremely helpful and responsive, and other students were helpful too. I believe there was also an introduction to C office hour held at the beginning of the course (but I did not attend). By far the best class I've taken so far. I don't have a CS undergrad but took C programming eons ago. TAs & prof are truly involved and vested in making this a great class. Exams are challenging and projects are like what all the other posters state. TAs on Slack were a huge help getting through the projects. Find yourself an IDE that you like. Extra credit opportunities. This class is one where you get out what you put in. I learned a ton and it was a really rewarding class. Definitely recommend! And definitely participate in their Slack channel! Lectures: Good quality, and most of the readings were summarized to some degree during lecture, which helped to get through some of the dense parts of the assigned readings. \n\nProjects: 4 projects (10% overall grade each). Project 1 and 3 took a lot of time. Project 2 was mostly analytical, no programming. Project 4 was a shorter project since we were at the end of the semester. You could do optional extra credit for projects 3 and 4. This extra credit added a lot of time and since I was in another class I didn't make much of an attempt at it. \n\nExams: midterm (25% overall grade) and final (30%). Exams were multiple choice/fill in the blank/short answer kind of questions. Exam averages were around 75%. \n\nI took CSE6220 in Fall 2015 (previous semester) and this class is a bit easier and a bit less time intensive. \nI took CS6300 with this course and it was a doable double (A in both courses) but I didn't get to read as much of the book as I wanted. I bought the book \"Modern Operating Systems\" (by Tanenbaum and Bos) for this course and I found it to be a good book. I don't think a book is necessary to succeed in this course, but it was nice to have a solid reference when I needed things explained another way.  Great course! I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone with no C background, but if you do have it - go for it! The class was very informative and offered a lot of base knowledge for Operating Systems. I suspect it would make taking AOS much easier. The lectures are very dense and should be watched carefully. There are 3 programming projects + 1 informational report project, they varied in difficulty. The tricky part of this class was keeping up with the lectures (+Udacity quizes), getting the projects done while preparing for the tests (Midterm and Final). The tests sneak up on you and were the hardest part of the class, given the breadth of information covered.  Coming from a C# background the the transition to C was a big change since we had to deal with memory and string manually. Exams were difficult for me but I hope thats because I'm out of practice. I wish I allowed more time for reviewing for the final. We had a curve in the end so if you do poorly on 1 or 2 items try and stick it out and do as best as you can on the remainder. I wish I studied more on the exams. Please do not wait until the last minute to start ANY project. Start the projects as early as possible and don't be afraid to collaborate via Piazza. We had several strong C students helping weaker individuals. All in all I enjoyed the programing assignments and felt I learned a lot. I'd recommend this class to anyone, with the difficulty comes satisfaction of complition.  The only reason I put difficult is because of the time investment. The material is not overly complex. It is very well taught and professor Ada is very knowledgeable and helpful. For me, the midterm exam was more of a semantic challange than a straight-forward exam the final on the other hand did not feel that way. If you do not know C you will be in for a lot of work. In my opinion, the material in this course is foundational and should be requried for every CS graduate. Start the assignments as soon as you get them! This course was FANTASTIC. Recommended to anyone. You will need to get familiar with C for the projects and overall understanding. \n\nProjects were great. I honestly thought they were amazing experience into the world of multithreaded programming and really getting a good handle on C, and they complimented the lectures really well. I have never really wanted to hang out for a weekend, drink a beer, and do a homework project until this course. They will take some time though, so allocate time accordingly.\n\nTests were tough, but fair. Make sure you read the papers and the lectures, and study hard.  **My background**  \nHave used C language for numerical analysis for years  \nDon't have any degree related to computer science  \nTook this class for the first course\n\n**Review**  \nThis class uses C to program server-client file transfer concepts. There are 3 projects, beginning from simple *echo*ing server to a server that does some sophisticated jobs like receives a file from a client, do requested work, and send back the result to the client where both server and client are multithreaded. If you are not familiar with these programming concepts, it will take time to understand and do the first project even if you have used C for different applications.\n\nAs this class declares itself as *intro*, the lecture covers pretty wide range of topics. Watching 1 Udacity lecture video took me about 3 to 4 hours. There are 4 to 6 lectures per part and there are total 4 parts, you can calculate how much time you have to pay for watching Udacity videos. I recommend you to keep notes for every video otherwise you will not find relevant materials when preparing for the exams. I kept notes with MS Word and I spent about 4 pages per lecture.\n\nThe workload I specified (==10hr/week) is the peak load when there is a project. I spent average 2 hours a day for a whole week to complete the project before the due date. If you are smart and can find an easy way to implement the problem, then it should be shorter. If you are going in the wrong direction, you will spend the whole week for debugging. When there is no project due, I recommend spending some time to follow the Udacity videos. It is quite long.\n\nThe instructor gracefully provides an expected question set for each exam. It is a shared google doc and students are encouraged to collaboratively fill the form. You can see other students' answers so you will find it very useful. There are two exams, midterm and final. And the final is **not** cumulative.\n\nThe instructor also encourages you to read provided literature. She actually covers what the provided literature is doing, and it will be also on the exams. But those technical papers are hard to read and also not very fun to read, honestly. Great course. I went into this with VERY little understanding of how to program in C and I've had to learn a lot, but that's the idea here, I think. You HAVE to start on the projects early, becuase they are complex and take a lot of work to complete, at least for those of us who aren't already realy good at C. One thing to note... they're relieing on Extra Credit assignments rather than a curve... so just additional coursework if you want the A and struggle with either the projects or teh exams... I don't really like this setup, but oh well.  The course material is very good and very organized. The instructor is very nice and she responds to all questions thoroughly and promptly. The biggest problem is the projects. Projects are in C language. You are expected to be proficient in C in order to do well in the projects. The help in the project is not so good from the teacher or the TAs. Also the level of the projects is difficult and it is not very clear what you need to do or the steps you can follow to finish the projects. Keep in mind that you also need to read a lot (papers) outside of the course material (slides) given by the instructor. I unfortunately dropped the course because I could not do the first project. I wish I can return to the course when I know C better and probably nail it with a B.  I highly recommend this class. The concepts are logically laid out, the lectures are easily digestible, and the support from the Professor and TA's are well above average. The midterm content was no surprise but it was challenging. The projects are easily the biggest time investment. Based on voluntary polls I conducted on G+ students reported spending on average about 40 hours on project one and three, and about 5 hours on average on project 2 and 4. There are also many opportuniteis for extra credit. There are very easy ways to prepare for this course, download an ubuntu linux VM and start writing C that reads and writes from files, sends text and data overa TCP/IP socket, performs string manipulation, and parses command line arguments. These skills were necessary to complete the projects, but not the focus of the project. Despite how much work these projects require, you have plenty of time to start on them (you can start project one on day 1 and it is due 6 weeks in). NOTE: I spent on average 10-15 hours per week, but this is because I worked ahead on light weeks. If you strictly follow the syllabus you will not succeed. For example the first two weeks of the course only took about 2 hours a piece to complete, but I used that time to start project 1 early and it paid off. Start early, use the forums on Piazza, get used to linux and C, and fight the urge to be a perfectionist. It is easy to self induce work on these projects and overwhelm yourself. There is no need to turn in production quality code.  General Comments To be honest I took this course because all others were full, not because I'm into the topics. However it turned out to be a great course, mainly because of the amazing instructor. A good range of topics were covered, including multi-threading, memory management, distributed systems etc. Nothing is really difficult but there's a lot of memorization if you want to do well on the exams. Taking notes while watching the videos are necessarily to get good scores. \n\nThe projects are a different story though. You have to start early unless you are confident in C. I find them difficult since I had no previous experience with C. I ended up with an A, so don't walk away from this course just because you don't know C. There's a huge learning curve, especially for project 1. I got great help from TAs and students on Piazza. Project 3 was tricky too because of multi-threading and memory sharing. Project 4 looks straight forward but might take some time to figure out what exactly to implement. \n\nThe curve is very generous and there are several extra credit opportunities. If you spend honest time on this course you'll be fine.  This is an introductory course to the fundamental OS concepts, a good review of all relevant OS topics. The last section of the course covers a few topics about distributed systems: file system; distributed memory; datacenter technologies, which are becoming more popular in the growing cloud computing field. In my opinion, it is a must-take course for students in CS background who need some refreshment for their undergrad OS class. OS knowledge is a core background requirement for almost all CS programs. \n\nFor the projects: there are 4 projects in total and 3 of them are coding projects. The projects are in C and some familiarity of C is required. I already have C background but the challenge is to complete the projects and pass the Udacity online grading. The online grading can be tricky sometimes because the online grader sometimes does not give you sufficient failure information, besides it is usually more rigorous than your local test run on VM. Many times, you need to insert fprint to just debug. That always takes a lot of time. The piazza forum is always very active and helpful. I would not be surprised if someone has to spend 40-50 hours on one particular coding project. The tip is to start early so you can spread the whole work into 2 or 3 weeks instead of trying to finish it during last weekend. My impression from Piazza is that people who do well in the projects tend to start very early and engage the discussion very early. \n\nFor the exams, it is closed book closed notes exam. You need to study the videos and read the materials. It is not very difficult, but you do need to spend some time studying them since there are a lot of concepts and details there. \n\nOverall, it is a very good class. It can be frustrating in the beginning, but if you stick to it and go through the whole semester, you will probably learn a lot.  This is a very well organised class. Professor Ada is very active in the forum and always trying to make sure that every concept was learned properly. Projects can be overwhelming if you are not used to C, otherwise you can finish them in a short amount of time. First exam was designed in accordance to lessons and material provided. Tip: Start the projects as early as possible Overall, the class covered a lot of content and the instructor (Ada) and TAs did an excellent job working with the students to learn the content. For me, it was a great refresher in both OS concepts and C programming. The class does take quite a bit of time; the lectures are long and the projects are involved. \n\nThe curve on this class (at least when I took it) was quite generous. For those who are concerned about the amount of time the class consumes, those times are mostly based on students satisfying all project requirements, studying to do well on the exams, and completing the extra credit. If the curve is consistent from semester to semester, you can probably cut quite a few corners and still get an 'A'; if you are only shooting for a 'B' you can do even less (do so at your own risk!). \n\nNote: The structure of this class is learn about an abstract OS concept and then develop an application that uses that linux implementation of that OS concept. For example: learn about threading -> implement a program that uses linux pthreads. This is not a class where you have to implement the OS construct (I think that is reserved for AOS). Great class, took it my first semester in. The class for the most part is very well ran. The lectures are great, and the TAs are very active and helpful. An example of how well the class ran is that It took me less then thirty minutes to get the development environment up and running. Having Bonnie pretty much grade everything is also amazing. The TAs are basically grading that you followed the guidelines more so then actually pass/fail the projects.\n\nThe lecture material was good a lot of subjects that were covered was not covered in my undergrad OS class. They were very well organized. Sometimes I feel as the quiz math is a little hand wavy but I think that's more of the approach on watching the lectures then the quality of the lectures.\n\nThe projects itself can be difficult. There are about about a month in between projects, Slack/Piazza are very helpful even if the TAs are not around. As everyone says start on the projects early, I program only in C at work, and it's also this flavor of programming style and I had some issues, I can see how other students can spend lots of time on the projects.\n\nThe exams are very hard, and in our semester there has been some mishaps with the questions, and even some answer choices.\n\nOverall though the class is great and is very well curved. In my mind it's almost impossible to make anything lower then a B. Lectures are high quality with tense content. The first project 1 requires a broad knowledge of C programming topics or the ability to quickly learn it. There is a Midterm and Finals. Professor is very engaging and active in Piazza. The whole class really feels like it's intended to fill gaps as preparation for the Advanced OS course.   I understood the theory, but had lots of trouble with the application, since I'm not a programmer. Mostly have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C++. Be very prepared to spend all of your time aside from the videos on Piazza and trying to figure out where to start on Project 1.  The lectures are of very good quality, the format is well-designed. Projects can be very overwhelming. I had some experience with C so I wasn't totally lost (C is part of the requirements) but you really need to break down the projects in smaller parts, gradually building up your code. Project 1 gave some recommendations on how to do that. P2 was easier (no coding, just a report), P3 so far is as overwhelming as P1 and very intensive. They are very time-consuming. I'm spending too much time on the projects and not enough on the lectures. Midterm wasn't easy to me, you really need to understand very well the concepts and not just memorize. Professor and TAs are active on Piazza, watching the office hours (1h once a week) helps a lot for the projects. Need to know some basic commands on Linux also.  Fantastic, well run course off to a great start. Must learn (or already know) intermediate C to stay afloat with projects- structs, macros, makefiles, memory allocation & release, valgrind, using libraries. Helps to have a basic understanding of VM usage and a unix/linux environment- ssh, scp etc, as the provided dev setup is a Ubuntu VM. Programming in windows is allowed, the student must make sure all programming assignments will run on the provided VM before submitting. 'Works on my machine' sadly is not a valid excuse in this course. Lectures are good and dense. Some exam questions require some additional thought beyond repeeating back memorized facts, which can catch you off guard if you're not expecting it. Professor is actively involved and frequently participates in piazza, in addition to weekly office hour.  Ada is wonderful. You will want to be good with C programming to do well on the projects, and you should be okay as long as you have that. Linux experience is good too. The lectures are long and boring. The projects are unreasonable. It has a 40% withdrawal rate and that should tell you something. This is the only class that has such a large curve. 100-60 is an A and 50-60 is a B. Really if it is that hard you are not teaching anyone anything. You better be a really good C programmer with lots of spare time. Do not take this class with another class.  25% Midterm Exam\n30% Final Exam\n10% Project 1: Multi-Threaded Webserver\n10% Project 2: Experimental Analysis\n10% Project 3: Inter-Process Communication\n10% Project 4: Remote Procedure Calls\n5% Class Participation\n\nProjects require comfort in C and the ability to hand-code many things for which open-source libraries exist. \n\nUdacity auto-grader is frustrating at best. So often, folks would succeed with their implementation in the VM just to discover the auto-grader would fail. This made debugging nearly impossible and extremely frustrating, as the specific test cases exercised in the auto-grader are not revealed. \n\nLectures are lengthy and detailed. Anything is fair game, so volume is high. Still, the instructor's style is excellent. She explains topics clearly and concisely. At times, the real-world examples feel incomplete. \n\nWhile I was exposed to a ton of material, I felt I could have self-taught that material. The projects leave something to be desired.  I took this class my first semester in the program, alongside networks (6250). I almost feel like I shouldn't review this -- I didn't take advantage of the resources it offered. The instructor and TAs all seemed great and response time to questions and concerns was near immediate. But I acted like they didn't exist except the few times I had a specific question, and I suspect my learning suffered for it. \n\nThe lectures comprise the bulk of the learning material, along with journal articles assigned for most lectures. Most of those aren't too difficult, skewing towards older and easier to digest articles. Ada's a great lecturer and I have few complaints about the quality of the lessons. The recurring \"toyshop\" metaphor felt like a gimmick and wasn't particularly edifying, however. Some of the topics chosen were a little mysterious -- it's unclear to me how remote procedure calls, for example, are a good topic for an OS fundamentals class. \n\nYou'll spend most of your time on the projects. If you know any C at all they shouldn't be too difficult... though through a combination of poor planning and lapses in intelligence I couldn't figure out the synchronization necessary for Project 3 and received an extremely low score. Avoid my mistakes and start early. Each of those projects should be an easy A, if you're careful with your time and ask for help. \n\nThe tests, on the other hand... There are two and they jointly account for 55% of the grade. They are also pretty tricky IMO, so take 'em seriously. Also make sure you understand and can work out the problems from the lecture quizzes that need to be done by hand, some of those will surely come up. \n\nAll told I'm glad I took the class. I'll likely get a B, but if I'd applied myself a little better an A would have been achievable. More importantly, I've grasped the fundamentals well enough to have a base for continued learning. Edit: ended up with an A. My course grade was ~81, to give some idea of curve generosity. Projects are challenging and require some design -- you can't just sit down and start spitting out code (even with many years of hard-core C experience). I seemed to miss the mark on tests and come out with several questions that I had no clue about -- even though I could explain and use most of the concepts.  Context: I have no CS degree, but some previous classes with C++. This was my 1st OMSCS course. \n\nI feel that this course is a great introduction to the program. It is well designed and executed, touching on a variety of very fundamental CS concepts that are relevant to many other courses in the program. The instructors and TAs were readily available and concerned with students learning the material and being able to make it through. The lectures and papers covered a lot of material, particularly after the midterm, so it pays to stick to the schedule even when there are no firm deadlines. Two of the four projects (1st and 3rd) can be quite time-consuming, particularly if you aren't strong in C. I found the grading to be fairly lenient on the assignments. About 2/3 of the material happens after the midterm, making the final challenging. There were several extra credit opportunities, and the instructor indicated that there would be a fairly healthy curve on the final grades, so there is room to make mistakes and still get an A. \n\nThe one weak spot of the course, in my mind, was the second project, which seems to have evolved over time, but is still hanging onto an accompanying Udacity sandbox that is irrelevant, at best, or misleading, at worst. The grading for this one also struck me as strange. I see the point(s) that the project was trying to convey, but think that it could be accomplished better in a different format. I took this as a first course and was a little overwhelmed by the workload. The lectures are good, but the projects (especially project 1) can feel a little irrelevant to what's being covered in the lectures. My advice is to start the projects as soon as possible. Most of the learning comes from projects and preparation for the quizzes (midterm + final). I enjoyed the class! The course was well structured, and the professor explained things well. In the end, the grade was curved by a few points: I think an A grade was curved by 4 points but I don't exactly remember. Great way to start OMSCS! This was my first course in the program and I really liked it! \nYou will learn about foundations in Operating Systems, some abstractions and work hard on programming assignments! \nTo me the best part was actually the programming projects, where you will learn how to code in C using a Linux VM. I've never worked with C professionally, just a few semesters on my undergrad. As a professional Java developer working for quite time, I found the projects hard but really interesting to do. If you are a developer you will find your way. It took me the first project me to adapt to the \"C\" style. Used and abused of logs in my code. Never used a debugger in this class... \nProjects 1, 3 and 4 are about writing some programs in C. 2 Is about a performance evaluation. \nProfessor Ada and TA as awesome! They are there to make you succeed! So if you work hard you will get there... \nA few things to improve:\n - Project 2 descriptions are ambiguous. Although its meant to be straightforward, the way the questions / possible answers are written were confusing. \n- I found exams to be overvalued. 55% for 2 exams are too much compared to the project's workload. \nOverall I learned a lot enough to improve my developer experience. Totally recommended. Projects are interesting but not very difficult.. Exams are tricky.. This class (my first) has helped me grow as a programmer more than any other class I have taken. The programming assignments most certainly took me out of my comfort zone in this class. I did not have very much C experience before taking this class but would have done a lot better if I knew what I was doing in the beginning. The material is challenging but not impossible and the topics are very relevant and up to date. If you are planning on taking this class I would strongly recommend brushing up on your C skills. Super active Piazza participation.  This class is a decent way to start your OMSCS career. It is a good refresher course that will dive into topics like mutexes, semaphores, shared memory concepts and other IPCs. The projects were interesting and the use of automatic testing helped make sure all requirements of the project were met. The only disappointment I had was Project 2 was a take home quiz that I would have preferred the original project that others took in the past. Overall, I highly recommend this class as Ada and the other TA's were awesome and the lectures were fairly engaging and easy to follow along. Excellent class with a lot of material. Four projects, three programming projects which take ~40 hours to complete each, and one report. A ProctorU based midterm and final, which are challenging. I enjoyed the class and got a lot out of it, but it was a lot of work.  It's pretty hard for me to give an accurate commentary on this class because I have such an unusual background, but I can only really give advice that would be applicable to the general population interested in taking this course. About 35-40% of the students will drop, and this has been consistent throughout the terms so far. General programming experience almost doesn't even matter, but having the right experience does. People with 10 years of programming experience struggled. For reference, I had maybe worked a job using a higher level language than C for about a few months before taking this course, and most of my academic and job experience was fairly nontechnical in nature. I did not even graduate in STEM. \n\nOf course, understanding C is necessary to do well, but I can promise you that not knowing C is NOT the primary limitation that most people will suggest. Being able to take a spec, design a solution, test it thoroughly, and refactor to apply the right patterns are far more indicative of whether or not you will succeed in this course. I didn't find the programming assignments particularly difficult, but a lot of people struggled against the autograder so a bit of gusto for debugging would certainly help you as well. You should still start the projects early so that you can let the ideas marinate in your head as you're going about your daily routine. The tests were nothing to write home about; just your standard review of the details will do. What helped me most was taking screenshots of key video stills into OneNote and maybe writing a few supplemental notes to jot down specifics as I listened along at 2x speed. That workflow was sufficient enough for me to grasp the material. \n\nGoing by the reviews, this, Machine Learning, and Algorithms are by far the most time-consuming classes. I heard somewhere that AOS was easier, but the statistics seem to reflect an equivalent success rate (~40% drop). All of these classes will expect different things out of you, and this course in particular should challenge your programming abilities relative to other courses. Operating Systems classes are notorious for having the most legitimate programming assignments, whereas Algorithms on the other end of the spectrum expect you to have a higher level of mathematical maturity and the ability to write proofs, which fewer people possess. I CAN give advice on the latter, but this is not the review for that :)\n\nInstructor and TA support was pretty top notch from what I saw, although this won't be the case for every single course in the program. So I would take the course just because the experience was well made and well-supported, but definitely make sure that you have the right background before signing up! This was my first OMSCS class, and I really enjoyed it. I have a lot of experience with C/C++ and Windows internals. Overall, IOS was a great class for learning more about Linux OS internals, developing against a Linux VM, and getting familiar with the whole OMSCS process. I\u2019ve been out of school since 1995, so this was a nice way to ease back into academics. \n\nThe course grade was 25% midterm, 30% final, 40% projects, and 5% Piazza participation. The midterm covers the first 3/8th of the lectures, and the final covers the last 5/8th. Both tests used lots of multiple choice questions with multiple correct answers to be selected. Overall, the tests were tough but fair. I really liked the coding projects (P1, P3, P4), and project 2 was an interesting experiment. Dr. Ada and the TAs were great overall, and the autograders for the coding projects were very good. \n\nOver the 16 weeks of the course I spent the following hours per week: 16, 27, 19, 5, 9, 14, 12, 11, 28, 11, 14, 7, 16, 0, 17, 12. That\u2019s 218 hours, averaging 13. 6 hr/wk. I stayed ahead, read all the referenced papers (14), and did some additional research. The weeks where I put in 27 and 28 hours were when projects 1 and 3 were first assigned. \n\nI\u2019m only taking one OMSCS course at a time due to family and work commitments, and this was a great first course. I got an A without the curve. My only complaint was that we didn\u2019t get grades for projects 3 and 4 until after the final was over. So, for most of the course, you have to guess how you\u2019re doing based on whether your projects passed all the autograder tests. But when you\u2019re only paying $500 for a course, you have to give up something, which in this case was quick grading feedback from TAs who are also GT students.", 
    "CS-6210": " This is a wonderful course with very good content. Projects are very time consuming. Check out the videos on Udacity before signing up. I did not get a chance to go through the papers completely and relied on video lectures for most parts.  Survey course so material was more broad than deep.\n\nFirst half, up to midterm, is spent going over the design of older operating systems.  Second half on a variety of algorithms and \"libraries\" that served OS functionality (barriers, GMS, LVRM, things like that).\n\nFour projects.  The amount of time you spend on projects will directly correlate with your knowledge and comfort level in C/C++.  Other than the first project your algorithms/design approach will essentially be handed to you, and the point is to either implement the logic or learn a framework.\n\nWhile you can skate by not reading the papers, this will end up hurting you in the end.  Some of the complexities of the material is glossed over in the lectures only to be exposed in the readings.  Though if you correlate the \"hot topics\" of previous midterms/finals with the papers, you'll get a good idea of what papers are more important than others.\n\nOverall this is a difficult class but certainly doable.  It's reputation of being a \"weeding out\" class is fair.  The expectations of students is also fair.  If you are prepared to spend time studying, doing the projects, doing the readings, and otherwise engaging with the material you'll do fine. Overall I liked the class. I thought the projects were great. Definitely should go into this class with some C experience (or don't be surprised when you have to learn it). Exams, like others mentioned, require a lot of memorization. They gave us review questions just before the exams which you should definitely spend many hours going over and over and over again. My biggest complaints are the long delays in grading time and lack of participation in Piazza.  Great class. Prof Ramachandran does an excellent job of building intuition on operating systems. The projects were challenging but very satisying once you are done with them. Definitely brush your C knowledge otherwise you will spend uncountable hours trying to debug a seg fault. Pro tip : go through the exam solutions from previous semesters verycarefully and you will do very well in the exams.  Good course with enjoyable lectures. Lots of papers to read. 4 assignments in C. Not a lot of feedback from instructors, unfortunately. We didn't start getting our assignments back until after the midterm, and my last programming assignment wasn't graded until after the final. However, the course materials includes a number of previous exams and their answers, to get a feel for the kind of answers they expect on the tests.  I won't be exaggerating if I say this will be one of the most challenging courses you'll face in the program. I didn't know what I was getting into until the classes started, but quickly I realized this was going to be tough. \n\nThere's more material in this course that what you can cover without going nuts. The lessons are long and complicated, and each one comes with a bunch of scientific papers that you need to read and understand. I found the material fascinating but reading and learning the content of the papers will probably take some getting used to. \n\nThere are two exams in this class. Both are closed notes and for each one you have to understand a ton of content. The questions are not limited to single or multiple-choice which make the exams even more complicated. My class did very poorly on both exams, and we had to wait for a generous curve to pull our grades up. \n\nI scored 57 out of 100 on the first exam and an incredible 75 in the second. These, together with solid grades on all the projects, gave me all I needed to finish with an A. Participation in the class was also a big factor, so I recommend you make yourself visible as much as you can. \n\nBy the way, be ready to code a lot. The projects were amazingly interesting and complicated, and we had to code like crazy to finish them. Any previous knowledge of C will certainly help you out here, but I although my C was very rusty, I was able to pull through after some long nights. \n\nNot everyone was lucky on these projects, and a big portion of the class wasn't able to even find the solution to some of them. I'd recommend starting as soon as you get access to the project description because you'll need every minute you can get. \n\nOn this course you don't work on teams, so your success or failure is entirely on you. That being said, make sure you collaborate with everyone else in the class. That was one of the reasons I was able to finish all the projects and end up with an excellent grade. This course is extremely difficult if you are not a well versed C programmer. The time commitment to carry the reading work load and lecture material is not to be underestimated.  The workload is flexible depending on how deeply you want to read the papers. The video lectures are more or less sufficient for the exams, the paper reading is more for personal gain(and 1 or 2 for the projects) I loved this class, specifically the projects! I thought they were exactly what I was expecting out of a CS master's program. If you can figure out the autograder on the first project (GTThreads) you'll do fine. I spent SIGNIFICANTLY LESS time on the other 3 projects. Also, do not overthink the exams. They really are 'just parroting' (like Brad Cain says above) back what is in the lectures and the previous midterms that are given to us to study. Also, I think that the name of this class should be 'A History of Operating Systems'. It's really all about the innovations in OS design over the years and NONE of the operating systems that we study are still in use today. Again, REALLY great class, I enjoyed it thoroughly! I thought the assignments were quite interesting (especially the first one) but not too hard, probably because I've done quite a bit of C coding and system programming. I found the lectures and papers to be not terribly interesting; most of the material is from the mid-1990s, although the section on VMs was pretty good. The tests are unimaginative... if you can parrot back what you saw in the lectures, you'll do fine. (Contrast with CS7641, which had very challenging and interesting tests. ) A lot of reading, and very long lectures. The material is not that difficult, however, there is a lot of it, so expect to cram and dump for the two exams. I do not think reading the papers is that necessary, but recommended if you have the time. The projects were ok, but the requirements were sketchy and there were no tests at all. When you turn one in you have no idea how good it will perform. The projects for Fall were: VM scheduling/balancing, Barrier Implementations, GRPC/Threadpool, and Map-Reduce. All the negativity assigned, the professor is very knowledgable, helpful and the production value of the lectures were great. The professor even attended office hours. Very interesting topics. Very interesting programming assignments. Tons of reading.  I enjoyed the programming assignments, although I can't imagine trying to pick up C at the same time. The autograder was quite glitchy, a major time sink. Hopefully that's fixed now that it has had a few semesters. The exams were terrible exercises in memorization, no real analytical thought involved. Time commitment spiked around exams.  Tough course, the materials are very dense and cover a lot of topics. The topics mostly come from papers published 20-30 years ago but are still relevant (some are the foundations) of modern operating systems. \n\nProjects are interesting but require solid foundation in C/C++. You wouldn't want to spend time familiarising with C/C++ while the projects itself require significant time from design to implementation to testing. Plan to spend at least 30 hours to finish each of the project. At least one project requires you to start from scratch without any template. The good news is grading is quite lenient and often TAs forgive small mistakes or inaccuracy as long as the codes reflect your understanding of the materials. \n\nPiazza is moderately active, questions about course materials are usually answered during office hours. Prof Ramachandran is a very passionate teacher and he monitors closely the class in Piazza. \n\nThe video lectures explain most of the concepts very well, however there are a lot of details not mentioned in the lecture slides. My advice is to print the lecture slides and take notes on the details from Professor's speech. These notes will be very useful in the exam preparation. \n\nThere are tons of papers to read, most of them are the details behind the course materials while some are supplementary. I wish I had more time to spend time reading those papers, as throughout the semester I only managed to read ~30% of them. However if you watch the lectures, you should be able to do ok in exams. \n\nExams are, as others have stated, brutal. The midterm average was 58. The exams require good understanding of the course materials plus *very* good memorisation. Some questions from past exams reappear so don't forget to review them. \n\nThe grade is curved hence the grade will be relative to others'. Overall I enjoy this class and I recommend this class if you like low level stuffs and ready to spend at least 15 hours a week. Material was very broad and somewhat high level, focussing more on 'recent' OS developments and concepts, rather than focussing on lower level implementation details (more low level kernel info would have been awesome, but I do appreciate that at that point you are getting into specifics rather than concepts). The course itself was very hard and was certainly a challenge to do on it's own with a full time job. The exams are pretty hard and require you to go beyond the lectures and read the assigned papers fully to be able to interpret details.  Definately had to relearn C to succeed. The rest is videos, papers, flash cards, and test prep.  I really enjoyed the projects- they were fun, if not a little time consuming. The exams were tough but fair and they did provide a lot of study material. The exams covered some material that wasn't explicitely covered in the lectures, so you need to keep up on your reading. A lot of the material was older (some papers from the 1970s) but it does give a good foundation to relevant topics. I guess I found some of the lectures and material a bit tedious, but overall enjoyed the class.  Taking course in Fall 2014 and putting in a lot of time. First assignment (of four) took me about 75 hours and I have a feeling I still didn't do very well. (I am still waiting on the grade. ) Getting ready for the midterm exam now and feel like there is an overwhelming amount of material. Challenges that may be case-specific: Working a full-time job as well; Low - Medium experience coding in C Hours got lower per week as I came back up to speed with C. However, because the midterm was brutal for me, took more time near the end to study for the final which may have not been necessary. Better safe than sorry. Undergrad was back in the mid 80s for me so needed a little ramp up time as well. I concur with Andrew Wolfe with the exception of reading hours. I required more hours for reading per week.  I had trouble coming up to speed with C (as well), but as the course went on, my skills improved. To me, the projects were more difficult because of the language than because of what they were asking for. The lectures (videos) were terrific, but I found that it was a large amount of content, and as the first class I've been in for quite some time, it was hard to get back into the mode of learning.  There's a lot of content to cover and its diverse. My mistake was taking it easy till the mid-term, because of which the rest of the semester required putting in 4 hrs per day during the week and pretty much all of the weekend. This despite enjoying the course and doing generally well on the assignments. Could be because I'm coming back to studying after 16 years too. Tip: Download the videos and watch them at 2x speed in VLC.  Writing this mid semester to help others with registration decisions. \n\nYou need Linux running on your own metal for this course. \n\nYou need serious C chops. \n\nYou need passable C++. \n\nDo not count on any compute resources (VMs or GT cluster credentials) being provided. \n\nIf these things sound new to you, get them ready before the semester starts, and start every project early to get past logisitical and environmental challenges. \n\nGreat content if you make it past those undocumented hurdles. Excellent course if you like learning system internals. You will learn a lot if you follow lectures and read 25% of the papers. If you read more you will gain even more insights. Professor and TAs were great. Programming assignments took their fair share of time but if you know C then you should be able to get them completed. Plan to spend good 20 to 30 hours on each assignment. Exams take time to prepare. Overall I liked this class and recommend it highly to those who have time. \n\nPS: Don't mix it up with another course in the same semester if you are working and have a family. Good luck! This was my first course in the OMS CS program.  I only took one course this semester, and I am thankful that I did.  This course was very intense, and very interesting.  All projects were done using C and C++.  I suggest a good working knowledge of C/C++ or it will require a lot of extra effort for projects that are difficult in themselves.  The lectures are very well done, and very informative.  There is a lot of information and a lot of fine detail in the lectures.  On top of the long project assignments, there are 15-20 papers that are required readings.  A close to average Midterm score can be achieved without reading the papers, but just read the papers.  The exams themselves are entirely essay based, 25-30 questions, and are quite difficult. The course requires a lot of work, but I am happy to have taken it. I decided to jump into this program with both feet, taking 6210 and 6290 in my first semester. AOS was very difficult because of the breadth of the material. But I got a tip early that the sample midterms and final are the best resource for studying. I literally memorized the answers from the sample finals and managed to get an 84 on the final (after a 59 on the midterm). With good project performances, I still squeaked out an A in the class. In-depth C++ knowledge is really crucial in this class, because the projects required complete design, implementation, and testing, not just modifications or debugging to existing code. I've learned a ton in this class, and have greatly enjoyed it. The exams were frustrating because you basically have to memorize an absurd amount of detail and regurgitate it. You *must* be good at C or be able to pick it up quickly to do well in the class. The projects were my favorite part, and have taught me a great deal about operating systems.  In retrospect, I didn't have the prerequisites to take this course and it took a while to get up to speed. I studied hard and did well. You need to know the material pretty well to do well on the exams. On the other hand, it was literally, the best course I have ever taken. I loved it.  As mentioned by other reviewers, this class is broad. It focuses more on distributed systems and the contributions of theoretical operating systems than the details of current, commercial operating systems. The test questions are very similar to previous years' questions. I made quick passes through the lectures, memorized the three or four previous classes' tests, and got a B on both the midterm and the final: that was above average for this class. Course grades are curved or scaled after all of the test and project grades are in.\n\nThe part of this class that I really enjoyed was the projects. I've got a moderate amount of C/C++ experience: three or four classes in recent history plus some self-study. These really stretched my skills and helped me improve my ability with these languages. The final project (MapReduce) took me about twice as long as the first project. I was able to finish the first project with about two days of solid work (8-10 hours per day) and the final project with about four days. Your experience will vary.\n\nThere's one hint I wanted to add that I didn't see below: guess on the tests. If you're not sure of the answer, then make inferences from the question, flesh out an answer from whatever dim memory you've got of the subject, etc. I did so, and was rewarded. -It is a tough course. Requires on average 20 hrs per week and could easily reach 30 during projects. \n-Requires a good knowledge of C. Make sure to freshen your C skills before project 1. lynda. gatech. edu/ has some good beginner courses. Do check them. \n-Projects are released early and you have around 2 weeks to complete them. Always start them early and keep a close eye on piazza. A lot of good tips will be coming from your peers. \n-You need to keep some notes/summaries from lectures. Otherwise you will quickly get overwhelmed by the range of topics covered. Bhavin Thaker has created some awesome notes but covers topics form second half of course. Do check them https://www. researchgate. net/publication/299535414\n-For mid and final exam, start early and keep a day or two only to read past papers and their solutions. Some of the questions/topics will be repeating in past papers and you need to focus on them.  Difficult class (especially if you have a demanding job as well) but well worth taking if you want to understand the low level details of operating systems. There is a lot of content so making sure that you actually stay current with the class is very important (this is not a class you want to push off work). Learning how to read academic white papers is key to passing this class. Figure out which papers are heavily emphasized and concentrate on really understanding those papers. Make sure you have a strong C background or take the time before taking this class to really learn C. C++11 is required for the last 2 projects but I was able to finish those projects without any problems with just my C background. Make sure to start the projects as early as you can as that is key to making sure you have enough to complete the projects and address the edge cases. I took IOS in Spring 2015, AOS in Fall 2015. IOS was a good basis when you're not already familiar with C and systems programming. \nEvery lecture walks students through a single paper, explaining the concepts and adding historical, academical context. The selection of papers is very good, it's a journey through landmark ideas in systems research. Reading all the papers was impossible for me with a day job and hobbies. I resorted to reading the abstract and summaries (provided by peres as part of course requirements) for about three quarters of the material. \nThe grading of projects and exams seems fair and forgiving. \nThe projects are tough and require recognizing challenges and coming up with your own designs for them. Also you have to write your own test code, which can be a substantial part of the project. It is always recommended to start working on the project 2-3 weeks in advance to be able to ask questions on Piazza and also just to sleep over it and find solutions to problems. They are definitely not \"just doing the exercise\". \nThe course requires a bit of investment, but offers tremendous learning opportunity. I was also constantly drifting off into the subjects covered while browsing through Wikipedia, research papers and technical manuals.  Demanding yet rewarding at the same time. The curve at the end got me an A. This is a tough class as many have said. I think the hardest part is of course the mid-term and final. It really does require knowledge of about 36 white papers in order to answer the questions on the exams. I came across 3 questions on each of them that i had no idea what paper they came from, let alone what they were referring to. I spent days cramming, and re-watching the lectures. \n\nThe projects are not impossible, but are very time-consuming in order to write, debug and get to pass auto-grader, and corner-case testing, however, given enough time (2-3 weeks) you can complete them. I completed 2 of 4 with A's but they took 40+ hours to get that over 3 weeks. I am a novice C programmer, so that was my downfall. I'm sure others with a high level of C programming did them in half or less time, but they are covering subjects and APIs that we are given and forced to use, that come with no instructions, we had to fumble about them to figure out how to use them correctly. \n\nIOS will help, if you are not fluent with C. Overall this is definitely one of the harder classes in the program, BUT I did learn a lot, and I'm a better C programmer because of it. \n\nOH one more weird thing... the PIAZZA participation grade (3% overall), seems to be based on an algorithm of Days logged on, posts read, and contributions. The number one contributor gets a 3, everyone else gets something less. There were just a few days difference between our top two contributors (600+ posts each), and one got a 3, while the other got a 2. 9. I had 87 days, 479/607 read, and 58 contributions, and scored a 1. 2 out of 3 points.  Fourth class in the program (previously taken IOS, SDP, IIS). I agree with the general consensus of the reviews already posted here. The projects are difficult (would be extremely difficult if your C/C++ background is very limited). Tons of papers to read. The exams are also difficult, though previous exam solutions are extremely helpful. Exam questions don't seem to strictly repeat, but tend to cover the same concepts.\n\nThe workload isn't extreme. I had some experience in C/C++ and most of the projects took 20-30 hours, with the exception of project 4, which is a huge project and took me well over 40 hours. I generally spent 6ish hours on papers and lectures per week.\n\nOverall, the class is informative, well-run, and the projects are useful and interesting. I enjoyed the class very much and wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone. Great course, but very difficult and time consuming if you want to learn everything in this class. \n\nMidterms and final are difficult, but end of course is curved fairly significantly. Project 4 will take you a long time, half of the projects in C, half in C++. Worth reading and learning a bit of C++ if you have only worked in C, like me.\n\nOne of my favorite if not my favorite course so far. The projects were actually OK, but you absolutely have to start at least 2 - 3 weeks in advance of the due date because you'll be coding in C and the low level nature of the language makes it very easy to make silly bugs, so plenty of testing and debugging time is needed. \n\nPapers - yes there are lots of them, but I only skimmed through about 1/3rd of them, most I didn't even bother to read... but I did watch the video lectures thoroughly and took lots of notes as well and this was helpful because the instructor does a good job of covering the core concepts of the papers. \n\nTo prep for the midterm and final, I went through the review questions they posted on T-Square. This takes a while because you have to commit a good deal to memory, so make sure you go through these and also all of the previous midterms and finals (which they also post on T-Square), at least a week or two in advance of the tests. \n\nFinally, to prep for the course, I would strongly advise that you brush up on your C coding. You don't need to be a guru, but make sure you have your dev environment properly set up with a decent IDE, and especially know how to debug programs. I didn't have to use valgrind for any of my projects thanks to the copious amount of unit tests that I wrote, but for the final project I did use valgrind to help me locate a bug. So it can only help to be familiar with that tool. \n\nMake sure you also participate in Piazza - those are easy points you don't want to give up ;-p\n\nGood luck to everyone! A time consuming yet intriguing and relevant course for distributed applications; not for C and C++ beginners. Coming into the course, I had only undergraduate CS experience with C and C++ and I was able to complete the assignments. However individuals with no C or C++ background would have to spend even more time debugging and learning C++ pointers, structs, and templates. Also take notes as you go, there are many in depth lectures and reading assignments to cover; more than average.   I discovered too late in the semester how helpful the papers were. There was a large spike of time spent on some of the projects, but that might have been because I had never seen a line of C code before.  If you programmed in C/C++ for at least 2+ years professionally, the programming assignments are not difficult at all (most are toy programs), but I'd imagine it's be different for people who wants to learn C at the same time. The TAs are very responsive and helpful on the forum compared to computer networking which I also took. The video lecture are not succinct enough for my taste, I feel like they can be 30% shorter. The midterm & final tests are not that useful, you'll soon forget the memorization you cramed during the tests. Also, even you understand 100% what is said in the video, unless you study the past exams, you'll not know what you need to remember in order to do well in the exam. For me, I never read the assigned paper (typical academic paper that don't get to the point, 10% of them are well written, the others are painfully boring to read), I just prepare flash card from past exam paper, spent one solid week+ to recall all the answer before the mid term and final and got A in both tests. A great 70-80% of the questions are repeated from past exam. If you can score 50%+ for the rest of the new questions (which they also give you study notes without the answer key), you can easily get a solid 80%+ score in each test and secure your A.  The class content can be time consuming if you don't have any background, but the coding assignments are the time consuming part. If you are a master of C (or at least competant), then you should be fine. About 2-3 hours of class content, 1-2 hours of reading papers (depending on how fast you read and comprehend some of the papers are hard to get through), and 2-8 hours of coding per week depending on the assignment.  Professor Ramachandran is great educator. He delivers lectures in clear and logical \nmanner, so even if in progress you have some questions, by the end of the lecture it is all clear. \nProjects in C could be overwhelming for someone without experience, but not impossible. \nAll what is on exam is covered in lectures, and sample midterm and finals are given, so it is very clear\nwhat is the scope and the format of the answers expected. Highly Recommend.  Stay away from this class if you have a very busy work schedule. I was able to manage without much prior background in C but it took a lot of time. There are a lot of papers to read which is good and bad. Good, because you learn how to read papers quickly as you have so many to deal with. Bad, because they are time consuming. I think the biggest bummer for me was having a closed book mid-term and finals. I think that was just a huge waste of time cause you end up memorizing things which are just gonna be retained for a short duration. I liked the content though it can be surely improved.  Projects were a major pain, people did awful on the midterm and final, but somehow the polling shows a ton of people got As in the class. This should tell anyone that this class is broken. \n\nIf you start this class, don't drop it, because chances are you will get scaled to an A or a B. Here is a link to a grade distribution chart that showing there are very few Cs, Ds, and Fs given. http://critique. gatech. edu/prof. php?id=RAMACHANDRANUMAKISHORE#CS6210 \n\nThis was my first class and I would consider it garbage. Yes, I learned a good bit and the concepts in the projects were good. Our class avg on the midterm was a 56. 5 and the median was 57. 75. The grades on the final were mostly C's. Even with such awful grades, I would say they were very gracious in the grading. I got a 77 on the midterm and a 73 on the final, and if they had graded them correctly I would have done much worse. I flat out didn't read the papers, and only studied the videos and my notes on them. I also didn't do the paper summaries and I somehow only got 30% on the message board participation. Actually there were people who posted hundreds of times and were very helpful that only got 2/3 of the participation points. Anyways, I got an 83 unscaled and somehow got an A in the class. Anytime a teach has to scale this much and has such poor test grades, the teacher is doing a poor job. From what I've read, I don't expect other classes to be such a mess though.  This was my first course in OMSCS, and although this class is known to be difficult, I found it to be very valuable and enjoyed Prof Kishore's enthusiasm. I had very little experience coding in C++, and I had never coded in C before. The first two projects were in C, while the last two projects were in C++. I put it in a lot of hours into this class, trying to learn C/C++ as well as trying to succeed on the projects. Because of the extra effort, I did really well on the projects.<br>\nMy favorite projects were Project 2 (C) and Project 4 (C++). For Project 2, we had to use the libvirt API to create a CPU scheduler and memory coordinator to manage virtual machines with varying resource usage. For Project 4, we had to create an implementation of the MapReduce using gRPC - this was the biggest project in the class and was also the final one. They gave us 4 weeks instead of 2 weeks to finish it, and I think I spent 3 weeks total on the project.<br>\nI found the exams to be difficult because you basically had to memorize a lot of information. This class covered several different operating systems and algorithms that were developed decades ago. Old midterms and finals were already on T-Square, so if you had to time to go through all of the old tests and skim through the research papers, then you would do fine on the tests. I definitely preferred the projects over the exams though.<br>\nThe class is curved at the end though, so as long as you start on the projects early and score really high on them, and not completely bomb the tests, you can get an A in the class. You might be in autograder hell for some of the projects. Pay little attention to students who say they studied only 5 to 10 hours a week. It's a lie. You can't even do a good job reading and taking notes for papers in that much time. Of course, you can memorize/parrot all the material in the videos (including the pecuilar pharses) and get an A, but you have to ask yourself if that's what a quality graduate course should be about.  This course was easily the most difficult course I've ever taken, but it's well worth it. Prepare to read a ton of papers, code some awesome projects, listen to brilliant lectures, and learn an absolute ton. I had been writing file systems for about 4 years prior to taking this course and I learned a crazy amount. \n\nHighly suggest this course, but be prepared to work. I'm a C# coder, so getting up to speed in C took some time, but I had a lot of fun learning how to code in C. It was interesting coding in a way that one would just take advantage of a library in C#. Definitely get started on your assignments early. \n\nThe course material was very interesting, and I will be applying what I learned in this course to aspects of my job. I didn't get into the papers in great detail, I found the lectures provided a great summary of the papers. \n\nIf I had one complaint about this course, it would be that the assignment turnaround was a slower than I'd like.  The wide time range is because I tended to complete the projects in one continuous rush once starting them. Other than that, there are a lot of lectures to get through and papers to read, but no hard deadline for them other than the exams. I'd recommend getting as much done ahead of time as possible, but the class offers a lot of flexibility with the time demand. I'd never written a line of C before taking the class, but was familiar with C++. The projects took about a weekend each, but every hour of that weekend. I spent far more time in the first half than the second half after realizing how questions are effectively recycled for the exams from past terms. They provided us with review questions and past exams with solution keys. Use those to guide what you memorize in minute detail and you can cut down how much you need to study.  Disappointed by the content so far. Rote exams, with little insight required. Projects are fun. Detesting all over again the online exam format trying to draw diagrams with computer tools. Will update this again later. This is not what I thought would be Advanced OS and not learning something useful. \nThis course has precious little to do with advanced operating systems concepts and more to do with 1) history of OS concepts, and 2) applications sitting on top and using OS resources and applying computer science concepts of data structure and algorthms\nAdvise you to scan through the videos as soon as you get access and decide if the content is worth it. \nhttps://www. udacity. com/wiki/aos/video This is was my first course in the program and it was a pretty rewarding in terms of what I learnt and how I performed. Though it requires a good amount of work to be done for projects and assigned readings. In fact I am glad I did not pair it with any other course.\n\nThe course covers the OS principles, its history and its relevance today. It\u2019s pretty interesting to know how latest technologies of virtualization and cloud have its basis on principles from the 80s and 90s. The videos explain the topics well and have assigned papers for further readings. I must have only managed ~30-40% of those (some 40+ papers are provided at the start of the course.) The midterm and final questions are not MCQs and require some memorization as answers are to be given in bullet points/essay form. However the previous year papers and solutions are quite helpful in understanding the pattern. From lectures and previous year papers one tends to figure out which research papers are more important from exam point of view, though others are equally important from a learning perspective. Midterm and finals are 42% of the total grade. Grades are based on a curve. \n\nThere are 4 projects to be done and they require good C/C++ skills (C for projects 1, 2 and C++11 for projects 3, 4). Even with knowing C++ for last 9 years, the projects were not easy. Project1 was quite difficult, with many test cases to cover and Project4 required writing a lot of boilerplate code(~40 hrs of work, 1000+ lines of code). However all the projects were interesting and offered something new to learn.\n\nProf. Kishore is a great instructor who teaches very passionately and the lectures explain the topics very well. Office hours happen once every week. I could not attend any live but videos are recorded and shared for later viewing. The TAs are also pretty responsive and helpful, I was pretty surprised that they accepted my request to reassess my midterm solution.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a great course with lots to learn (you would not be writing your own OS here if that's what you are expecting but you will learn a lot about OS principles, virtualization, distributed systems etc.)\nAdvise to anyone who is interested in taking this course - be prepared to work hard, DONOT start the projects late, brush-up on C/C++ skills if you are not using it on daily basis, it would not be easy learning it on the go. And try to follow the schedule provided for watching videos, I missed the schedule after the midterm exam as I was employed more than full-time at work and I had to slog a lot towards the end.\n There are two distinct components to this course and your grade. First the projects. There are four of them. They are interesting and challenging. You will need a strong understanding of C to do well. If you are a C guru expect to spend about 10-15 hours for each project. If you are weak or new to C this time estimate could easily be trippled if not more. The second component is lecture and reading material. It is complicated stuff. You could easily spend 20 hours a week understanding and trying to memorize all the academic paper assignments. The two exams will quiz you on this material and you honestly need like a photographic memory of the material to do well on the exams. Considering the average mid term grade was a 50%, I don't think many of us have a photographic memory.  Hard course, huge workload, a few hard concepts, project specs unclear. \n\nTL;DR\n\nOperating Systems have evolved to meet user needs and system developments, and this course examines important developments operating system design, recognizing the influence of hardware advances. The student views lectures, read academic papers, constructs projects, and sits for midterm and final exams (also a brief homework, two paper summaries, and forum/class participation). \n\nThe material is expansive but interesting, and the student learns about important developments in systems, including parallel and distributed systems, hardware\nimprovements, and network speed. \n\nLectures: cover important topics and explain important concepts, watching twice may help identify and understand more important topics/ideas. Professor clearly knows the material. \n\nExams: Midterm and final were humbling, vast amount of data, require precise details, previous midterms/finals available, most questions recur, focus on those topics. \n\nPapers: read (nearly) 40 papers (required and optional), plus other relevant papers; learn to efficiently read and understand academic papers and glean important content, reread important papers. \n\nProjects: require Linux (ubuntu VM), and good C programming skill;\nuserthreads - learn about user space threads, scheduling, context swaps, signals, locking;\nbarriers - learn about MPI, OpenMP distributed computing, barrier synchronization, write performance summary;\nweb caching - learn about RPC, caching (LRU, LFU, LRUMIN), measure performance, test case bias;\nreliable virtual memory - learn about transactions and log structured files. \n\nProjects take 30-60 hours each. Papers average 2. 5/week (2-4 hours each). Study for midterm and final (20-40 hours each). You will learn enough about systems work to decide whether the area interests you. I reread many papers, and watched most lectures 2-3 times. \n\nProject specifications were ambiguous, students shared tests, share the test case writing workload, typical online challenges (questions, feedback), test proctoring had problems. I took 2 days off to study for finals, and 2 other days off to work on projects.  Challenging course, especially for those who are not used to reading and learning from a bunch of technical papers -- the whole course is based on a set of 40-50 technical papers in the operating systems arena. Instruction videos were good, covered the content well. The papers were mostly interesting. Student evaluation:\n\n* Tests - two tests that make up 46% of your final grade are brutal if you don't have an eidetic memory to remember all the content of all the papers. On the final, of 49 students participating in a pole, only 1 thought they got a 90+, 4 thought they got an 80-89 and down, with the largest group < 59. \n\n* Projects - four projects make up 48% of your final grade. The projects were challenging if you aren't a good C programmer, but not overly so. They were a bit under-specified which made it hard to know for sure you were doing things the \"right\" way. Much of our discussion on Piazza was in trying to interpret what we were supposed to do about edge case X or edge case Y. \n\nHoping for a strong curve....  test require a week to learn in advance. some assignment took me more than 20 hours.  This class had a huge workload; there were project deadlines and exams every other week the semester, it seemed like. I took several days off of work during the semester to study for exams and work on projects to get them done in time. Workload fluxuated between 10 hrs and 30 hrs per week. \n\nThe material is really good, though. They cover all of the fundamental concepts, at some level, that are needed to create a large scale web distributed application, from threading to memory management to filesystems to network distribution and concurrency... \n\nThere are a ton of papers for this class. I spent a lot of time trying to read them all for the midterm, but didn't do as well as I'd have liked (although i was average for the class). I spent more time taking previous exams for the final and didn't read any of the papers, except to find solutions to questions, and did really well. I don't know that the same strategy would have worked for the mid-term, but I'd consider it next-time through.  The assignments were fun, of fair difficulty and useful to the learning process; it helps to know C in advance. The tests are difficult and sometimes seem focused on minutia, but if you invest time into study, you are given all the necessary tools to do well (everything can be answered between the papers and the lectures, and sample tests are given so you know you're going in the right direction). It's going to take a lot of studying, but if you do well, you will have truly learned a lot from the course.  The material was very interesting, and I definitely learned a lot, but some of the test questions seemed like they required more memorization of facts from the lectures than application of concepts. I am writing this review after dropping right before the due date of the first project, roughly a month into the class. Mainly had to drop because a newborn and toddler in the house made it almost impossible to get any work done. \n\nThat said, this class had a lot of required reading. Not the most interesting material to read through but it is scientific papers so be prepared to read papers several times. I think on average there were 3-4 papers per week. The first project seemed reasonable but a lot like the projects in IOS (which I took Fall 2015 and did very well in). You will fight with the autograder a lot and instructions were fairly vague. Good help from Piazza though. \n\nFrom looking ahead before I dropped there is A LOT of material you are tested on in the midterm/final study guides that comes directly from the papers. This might be the reason that the test grades are so low. \n\nI was excited to take the course but after spending just over a month in the course I'm glad I dropped it. Definitely information overload from the papers and trying to digest those left me exhausted when tackling the project. If the instructor trimmed down the readings a bit so you could focus on the lecture material and projects (where you actually learn IMHO) then this could be a good class. Until then I will not be signing up again.  Don't take this course as your first OMS class. If the intent was a weeding out course this is it. \n\nIt's been 20 years since I took an OS class. The content covered in the first two or three lectures was about the extent my brain could take. Thank goodness you can re-watch the videos. I filled up a spiral notebook in the first 3 weeks. \n\nAt the time I took the class the white papers were \"recommended\" reading. That should be changed to required reading and you better start reading them daily. Download all of the previous semester(s) mid-term and finals early to get a good idea of what to expect. \n\nI got a 48 on the mid-term. Ended up withdrawing from the class and was lucky to make it before the deadline somehow. A friend stayed in and ended up with a 57 and got a B! I am sure the class has good content but what a shock as to how much was flowing from the pipe. If you aren't sure about the Adv OS then take the Intro to OS. Both of them count toward the requirement. This course was very informative, but required a lot of work on the projects and especially on the assigned readings.\n\nThis course covered a lot of OS principles, both historically and relevant to today's environment. It was interesting to learn of many concepts that were \"ahead of their time\" and just now coming into mainstream given cloud and data center technologies.  \n\nThe projects were slightly harder than average difficulty and required good knowledge of C++ (in particular C++ 11). Coming from a C++/embedded background this was not too difficult, but given some of the Piazza posts many had problems in this area.  Most projects had \"multi-threaded\" attributes, so a good understanding of threads is a good thing to know coming into the class.  Nonetheless, all the projects had a high \"learning value\", introducing us to several technologies I haven't been exposed to (but expect to put into practice).\n\nThe assigned readings were also voluminous, with many of them supporting the lectures. Plan to spend countless hours reading these papers. Several details of the papers were asked on the midterm and/or final exams, so this is not an optional component of the class. Most of the papers were actually quite informative, though some went into a lot of details and performance evaluations, which could've been summarized in just a few sentences (I mostly just skimmed these sections and got the necessary information our of the summary).\n\nBy far, the most challenging aspect of the course were the midterm and final exams, which together comprised 42% of the overall grade. These tests were quite simply \"hard\". The tests did not exactly focus on the facts learned during the course, but instead on whether the student understood the concepts/facts and could make additional deductions on those facts.  The exams, while still performed in Verificent/Proctortrack were all essay type questions. Even the True/False questions required an explanation in order to get credit.  The exams were definitely comprehensive over the material.\n\nThe lectures were actually quite good. The professor took the time to convey key concepts, including examples and details. Of course, his lectures were primarily an overview with examples of the assigned readings. The TAs were quite helpful and responsive on Piazza.\n\nPerhaps the only negative (I consider the \"difficulty of the course a positive) was that the projects took a long time to be graded.  At midterm (i.e., time to withdraw), only about 30% of the grades had been posted.  This may have been caused by significant events during the early part of the semester (Hurricane Irma, Harvey and Katia) that impacted a lot of students (and in the case of Irma the Atlanta campus).  A special 1 time \"late forgiveness\" policy was however, introduced to accommodate those impacted by these storms.  I was a little disappointed in that the course did not go into more \"kernel level\"  OS details, but stayed a little higher level detailing how OS support newer technologies such as security, data centers and distributed computing systems, which seems to be more of the trend.\n\nI would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in distributed systems. Don't be misled into believing that the course is just an advanced undergraduate OS type course. You'll learn a lot in this course, but you'll also work hard to do well and be glad you took it (after it's over). We can divide this course into three main pillars: Papers, Projects and Exams. \nProjects: Heavily dependent on C and linux command line tools. So, if you are not familiar with C, consider learning it before the class. Projects itself are interesting and challenging to solve. The time provided is fair. \nPaper: This class has a lot of papers to read, be prepared to read 15+ papers. Need to understand every detail ( check next paragraph why )\nExams: You need to memorize past exams questions and majority of detailed information available in some papers. \nTip: Start the projects as early as possible ! Its a great course. I have had previous experience with OS's and I learned quite a lot. The course requires consistent effort. Not much room for slacking off. I allocated about an average of 2 hours a night. \nThe class consists of 4 projects, a midterm and a final. The course work is a mixture of lectures and academic papers. In order to do well, you must read and understand the papers, which can be long and dry depending on the topic. There are lots of papers to read. \n\nThe projects were interesting and not trivial. If you are well versed in C, then there wont be a big problem. If not, then you should probably get some practice. \n\nTips to do well, \n- Listen to the lectures\n- Read the papers\n- Take lots of notes\n- Start studying for exams at least a week in advance\n- Start the projects as soon as possible. \n- Participate in the Piazza forums  As others have noted, there is a ton of (very dense) reading material and the projects will take a good amount of work and effort. This was my first course of the program. While it was very time consuming and challenging at times, I'm quite happy with what I gained from the course and how I performed.\n\nSome notes for students looking / about to take this course:\n\n* Give yourself plenty of time for the project work. They can be time consuming, especially the latter projects. Especially if you're not familiar or comfortable working in C and a Linux (or unix-like) environment. A lot of other students seemed to struggle with the basics of settings up the environments needed to complete the projects.\n* For midterm and final definitely use previous midterms/finals as study material. Most of the questions are derivatives of previous years, or sometimes the same just worded slightly differently.\n* Read the papers! Read over every paper at least once to help gain insight into the topics discussed in the lecture videos.  And read the papers before the lecture videos.\n* Final course grade is curved. Everyone seemed to do mediocre or not-great on the final and midterm exams, but doing well on the projects and completing the rest of the assignments will help ensure a good grade out of the course.", 
    "CS-6250": " Took this class as a first semester class alongside IOS. I was not sure what to expect, but I ended up loving this course. The professor (Konte) was around for a couple of Piazza posts, answered a few questions about the exams, did two very awkward office hours, and that was about it. The head TA, Stacia, ran this course like a tight ship and really made it worthwhile. The other TAs were helpful and responsive as well. Communication was frequent and regular.  I found the content itself interesting, having familiarity only with the basics of TCP and a high-level understanding of internet architecture. I think I would have been fine without any prior knowledge of computer networks. The first few projects are designed like coding challenges in Python. They were challenging and I really enjoyed them, but they seemed to be a headache for people not familiar with Python or OO programming who took to Piazza to vent regularly.  The later projects were less time intensive and more about performing a set of trivial tasks and then analyzing the results against what was presented in the class. Some people got lost in the trees on these, more Piazza venting. I think I was lucky this semester in that there were a few very helpful and responsive students in the class who offered guidance on a lot of the class topics by their ability to summarize and explain the material on Piazza.  If you watch the lecture videos carefully, the programming assignments are straightforward. Quizzes can be little tricky but not too bad.  This clas needed the most time in writing the Python assignments. The syllabus stated that a minimum knowledge of Python was required, but early assignments were very complex for a Python novice. The quizzes were an excercise in frustration as questions were vague and often unclear. My knowlege of Networking has greatly been increased. Suggestion to all future students of this class would be to study Python and become quite proficeint prior to taking the class.  I found the course moderately difficult - not because of the material but for the delivery of it. It was difficult to navigate the course assignments & quizzes. Quizzes are tricky but did re-in force learning. Lectures are a bit dated (e. g. lecture talks about Skype being a peer-to-peer network but which I believe is not the case anymore). Assignments requires very little actual coding but more understating what we need to do. You do learn quite a bit if you put the efforts into it in this course.  I liked the lectures and I like the content of the projects. I'm concerned how the class would be without the head TA that was present for this semester, I feel like there was no contact or communication with the professor. This is my first OMSCS course I've taken so maybe that is the nature of it.\n\n Serious growing pains right now in this class - large size and no professor present. Issues with assignment requirements changing and ambiguous quiz questions paried with poor communication from TAs leads to half my time per week that is allocated to this class being spent chasing down posts on piazza and scouring office hours for answers. This time would obviously be better spent studying the material and doing my own research. But instead, it gets burned due to administrative issues. Couldn't recommend in current form.  This class isn't hard but it is really poorly run. I cannot recommend this clas because of how it is being run. If you do take it, assume what you have been told in your assignments is not enough and that there will be corrections that you can ONLY find in some burried thread on Piazza. The class have been basically unprofessional. For a class that is in its 3rd run I don't know why it is this bad. KBAI was infinitely better on its first run. The videos are nice and the homework itself isn't bad but when you have a case where a you do what is in the homework and match their pictures, only to have things rejected because of OTHER unannounced parameters.. its not good. Or to then have them request you copy and paste output from a terminal, only to find out that they watned MORE than they explicicity asked for is bad. What makes it worse than just all of that is their refusal to make a group announcement about the subject where it states EVERYTHING in one clear place. Instead you have to go through a whole Piazza post. Just awful.  Easy class but pretty awesome. Actually enjoyed the assignments besides the confusing quiz questions. This course is really about Software Defined Networking more than it is about Computer Networks it seems.  This course was one of my first OMSCS courses, so wasn't sure what to expect, but the course exceeded expectations. This course definitely covered a lot of areas of networks, at times almost too many topics. I also felt the Udacity lectures covered so much so fast. I often had to repeat each \"lesson\" 2-3 times to really capture and/or understand some of the concepts. \n\nThe tests (only 3 of them) were a little more difficult than I thought, but were fair and covered the material well. A lot of the test covered the outside readings and/or projects... definitely testing your understanding of the subject matter instead of just the facts of it. \n\nThere were a lot of projects (8+) in this course, and usually before you finished one, the next one was already out and time ticking on it. One or two of the projects were problematic (computer/VM wise) and were stressful to accomplish. I didn't mind putting in time to learn the material, but fighting with the tools was not productive time spent. I had a few commitments at work during this time which made it even more stressful. However, each of the projects were insightful and worthwhile, though a couple that evaluated certain protocol performance were not as exciting, but learned a great deal anyway. \n\nThe TAs (and Maria) were pretty responsive on Piazza, and held weekly office hours. \n\nFor me (after 25yrs) since BS degree, it was interesting to see how networking has changed and what was good then is being re-evaluated. Many of the concepts I've already put in motion on my company's projects and seeing some good results. Definitely a good class worth taking. I already had extensive experience with networks, so, the course was more an update on some concepts, like iBGP, etc. Seems is more difficult now than in previous offerings 2 years ago, for the better. \n\nTA's and instructor were very accessible also during Core Hours, although quite strict on Piazza about not sharing ANY code, not even a sample of a Python API call... they expect the students to work it out themselves. \n\nProjects in Python were easy if you had some programming experience, but I saw a lot of people suffer, for example, a web client (no Python libraries other than socket connections) was difficult for many... I deal with web applications, REST debugging clients, headers et all on a daily basis, but for many was the first peek at HTTP browser messages. \n\nOn another project, a Piazza \"clarification\" caused some confusion and misunderstanding, some folks duplicated the number of \"rules\": this was NOT necessary, made no practical sense, and the grader software *had* to be changed to accommodate those verbose submissions :-(\n\nIs a good review course, but be prepared to work hard, if you lack experience with networks and networking software. This course has definitely changed. I ended up withdrawing at the last minute (though I likely would have gotten a B had I stayed in). The class goes over some interesting concepts but I felt like the routing and switching projects were a little over the top. I think this class has moved from \"easy intro to modern networking concepts\" to a wide-ranging class that can be hard to understand what is required for projects. Overall, I would recommend against taking this class unless you work in telecom or are planning to work in a field directly related. With a networking background, I thought I'd enjoy this class. Turns out networking is effectively irrelevant to the coursework. Are you able to read API documentation and write 10 lines of Python? Then you, too, can complete this course with an A! This ought to be a second year undergraduate course, if that.  Obscure! Obscure! Obscure! Vague! Vague! Vague! The contents both in teaching stuff and project/assignment descriptions are unacceptably unclear. Particularly, the assignments have become a series of gamble and gotcha game. The course per se is not technically hard, though. Yet, you have to be a psychologist and linguistist if y\u2019all want to survive in the jungle.  Don't take this course. \n\nThe content is unstructured in that the open book tests do not test the video lectures, forcing you to spend endless hours looking in the internet sewer for answers (in stead of being able to find it in the lectures or a textbook). Read the other reviews carefully about the atrocious state of the quizzes. It's all true. This is my 6th course, so I know what's the OCMS standard by now. \n\nI deeply deeply regret taking this course.  The course is revamped from Summer 2015 with new professors, and it has become bit difficult course (not very easy anymore as in the previous semesters). We had 5 quizzes and 6 assignments in total, which comes alternatively in each week. Some of the assignments were easy and some were average to difficult. The quizzes were very difficult and needed lots of research on video material and extra reading (The quizzes are not the ones in the video lectures). Overall a great course, but not an easy course anymore New professor made the course better by providing interesting somewhat real-live projects and making brain teaser quizes (technically all the material needed to answer the questions is given in the video lectures, but you'd have to really 'put it together' to 'get it', or read some additional materia. Bottom line - to answer those questions you need to really understand the subject. Some people say it was easy, I thought so too afterwards, but nevertheless I did spent several 'all nighters' working on the projects (and so did a lot of people judging by the flood on piazza). Highly recommend.  You will take ten quizzes that were apparently written and designed by someone with a very tenuous grasp of basic networking principles, logic, and the english language. You will then be graded by some 20 year old TA that really doesn'y give a shit about any of this. And that's basically it. You'll get a B. I don't think an A is possible due to the quiz questions that have no correct answer.  Took this in one of the first few semesters. Grades were returned pretty quickly, but at this point the course has probably changed tremendously.  I loved this class. It's challenging and you learn a ton, but it's not frustrating the way some other classes can be. The lectures were fabulous and the projects did a great job teaching me Mininet and helping me get my Python skills up to par. Overall, a great first class for someone who has been out of college for a while.  This class was really cool. I didn't have any undergrad background in Networking so much of the material was new, but Nick did a great job explaining the material and I had no trouble following along. The assignments were easy for me, but I use Python as a primary language and have used *nix systems for almost all my work for the last 5 years. Basically you should be comfortable ssh'ing into a box, using the cli with emacs or vi. Using screen or tmux is going to help you alot too. Also, don't get too hung up on trying to replicate the exact numbers that the TAs got. You just need to get the code right and then your results will be reasonable.  Extremely disorganized class and an embarassment to this program, as documented above. The only positive aspect to this course is that some of the lectures are interesting.  Agree with all of the above statements. I took this course because I wanted to take a course that had a low difficulty level and would help meet one of the foundational requirements. Unfortunately, we spent more time debating the quiz & assignmenting file-naming conventions than actually discussing the content of the course. e. g. One assignment we were required to name a file 'quiz4', another assignemnt we have to name a file 'quiz-7' with a '-' character. Students obsessed over these details since the autograder scripts apparently cannot accept filenames with even the slightest variation (no wildcard characters??). All of the problems from this semester stem from a lack of leadership. There was no leadership from the TAs; not something entirely expected but it really hurt the course. The faculty of Georgia Tech provided no communication about this course's professor or his absence. There was no attempt to repair the course that clearly got off to a rough start. Although the content was somewhat interesting, we could never benefit from professorial interaction. I will not recommend this course to a fellow student until it is improved.  This clas is easy in some way, but very difficult in others. While the lectures are quite good, the quizzes are loaded with ambiguity and statements designed to trip you up. The professor has moved to Princeton, and while he's still the Professor of record, he's been 100% absent and only TAs are running the class. They constantly bury important information in Piazza posts, have inconsistent approaches to grading, rely too heavily on defective autograder scripts, have poor response time to questions, are argumentative, etc. In other words, the class is completely run by overworked and undertrained grad students, just like us. It doesn't make for a good learning experience.  This course was very easy if you know a bit of python. The videos were interesting, but did not help much with the assignments. The assignments were sometimes interesting, but at times did not require much work at all. \n\nGreat course to take along with a much more difficult course. Still very interesting if you are interested in internet networking.  Tests were ridiculously hard for closed book and needed lots of reading and memorization to prepare. Half the questions were free responses aka mini essays. Projects were pretty fun and engaging; wish the class were more of those instead.  On 2016 Spring Semester, we had \n+ 6 Projects (all python - very Easy) - 10% each\n+ 2 Tests (closed book - very Hard) - 20% each\n\nOnly 45% of the class got A's (90 and above), B was from 76 and above, so you can study hard and get a A or you can easily end up with a B on this course. \n\nSince it was a large class, there are a lot of people active on Piazza. Piazza posts helps a lot on doing the Projects. \nWe got 4 Homework (not graded) to prepare us for the Test. \nYou should be ready to read lengthy Research Papers for the Tests as well.  The lectures and projects were great. The readings were a mixed bag, some very interesting and some incredibly dry and/or densely academic. I learned a lot, and enjoyed the class overall. \n\nThe tests were pretty rough though. I got a high A on every project, but struggled to make two C's and a B on the tests even when studying a lot. The tests felt a little bit luck-based -- did you happen to remember one sentence from one of the dozen research papers you read? If yes, it was easy. If not, then impossible to guess. I don't think the tests did a good job judging whether you'd learned the big picture or even the majority of individual topics discussed, rather they seemed mostly a sample of minutiae from the papers which you may or may not remember. \n\nOne big warning, I think they've revamped this course in the last semester or two, because it was fairly challenging (especially the tests) and took a decent amount of time each week. There's some kind of project or test almost every single week, so you really don't get much of a break. \n\nPast reviews indicated this class was easy. I don't think that's true anymore. I'd say this class is relatively *tractable* in the sense that if you can put in the time to memorize all the papers you read, and put in enough time on the individual projects, you have a very good chance of earning an A. Just be warned that if you DON'T have enough time, you can easily bomb. Definitely not an easy one.  The course now requires you to watch the lectures to do well on the quizzes. You have up to 10 tries which helps (although you don't know which questions you got right/wrong). The projects weren't very difficult however they did take some time to understand. Six projects (10% each), five quizzes (8% each). One per week. Overall I enjoyed the course.  I thought the lectures and the professors explained the material very well. However, when you get to the quizzes, it sometimes requires you to review the lectures for a second time since the lectures can explain concepts pretty fast or go to external references to determine the answer. Some of the quiz multiple choice answers are also worded vaguely and can be tricky. I enjoyed the assignments. I think I also spent a lot of time catching up with all the posts made by the class to determine what bugs to look out for or clues to help solve the assignment. Overall, I still believe this is a good introductory to OMSCS class to take if you are willing to do the work.  I heard the course was revamped, but thought it was still on the easy side. I spent maybe a few hours each week working with the class. We had 6 assignments in python (worth 60% weight) and 5 quizzes (40% weight). Assignments were very simple and required just a little bit of scripting (my final assignment was adding ~6 lines of code). Every week you did either an assignment or quiz. The main complaint was sometimes the questions/instructions were a little ambiguous. The quizes you could retake 10 times.  Learned relatively newer networking topics. Course assignments had us replicate and analyze research experiments (e. g. TCP Fast Open, Buffer Bloat, SDN, etc). All projects were in python, which is a class requirement. In class forums, fellow students and TAs were helpful in resolving project questions and issues. Overall, great learning experience.  Some Python skills and Linux skills are required. This is mainly for the troubleshooting aspects though. Directions provided in each assignment are fairly explicit so don't be too worried if you aren't familiar with Python or Linux. Lecture videos contain some very good background information and theory. Take advantage of your fellow students for help. If you are struggling with something, chances are others are as well.  My first course and had purposefully chosen an 'easy' one. There were 6 projects with 60% weight and 2 tests with 40% weight. Projects were not tough if you know basic python and keep track of comments on Piazza. Tests need preparation and working through the lectures/homeworks. All in all no surprises and rewards you with A if you are working regularly.  I took this as my second course for the foundational requirements. You need to spend time on the projects as they are not straightforward. Read all the papers they ask you to read this is needed for the projects and exam! The videos and course content is the easy part. What I struggled with was the programming in Python which I had never done before. I would say you need to have a basic understanding of the language to take the class since all 9 assignments require you to do some coding. You should be able to read existing code, be able to make loops, create functions, etc... After the third assignment I went to Codecademy and took their Python class which took about a week. After taking this things got slightly easier.  It was really a great course. I learned TCP concepts to the depth . Very practical oriented class. TAs were good. Lectures were good. Course content was really good. Lots of reading on research papers. I had to memorize a lot for the term end exams. Best part of this course was SDN. I loved it. Few projects in the beginning were real tough ones. I almost did not sleep for a week. As I made progress and attended office hours, I could complete them. I got deeper knowledge on TCP/IP and , data center operations, network topologies,  subnet masking, Router configuration, security aspects etc. Overall, I liked the course.   I don't want to say this was an easy course because it was my first one and I have nothing to compare, having said that I got an A. The three tests were multiple choice and T or F. The projects were not too complicated; they required some planning first. The projects are coded in Python using a provided VM with all the tools included. The extra credit included participation and a second part in the last project that was totally doable. I recommend it as a first course. The videos were not that bad, and you'll have to read 10 to 14 papers in total to be able to do the projects and for the tests. I learned a lot in this class despite it being fairly easy.  There were 8 projects and 3 tests total.  I'll expand on this review later... Don't look at the reviews prior to Summer 2015 as it has been taken over by a new professor since then and it is different than before. There has clearly been an attempt to make the class harder even though I believe some leniency was given near the end of the semester making the grades much higher. This is my first class and below is my review:\nPros:\nClass projects were interesting and fun\nThe professor holds regular office hours and is responsive during those times\nEducational and I learned alot, granted I didn't know anything about networks going in. \nCons:\nTest questions lead to ambiguity and make it harder. Even when valid arguments were given for bad questions no credit was normally given. Meaning people never really well explained how they were wrong. \nLast project didn't work well and instead of fixing just made it optional as a way to replace. Project was really interesting and wish it had been fixed. \nTAs were fairly helpful in Piazza but the Professor was very slow at responding to things needing his attention. Overall many times got more clarification from classmates than from the TA or professor on Piazza. I feel lucky we had some talkative classmates. \nAlot of need to research outside sources to get answers to test questions. Not testing my understanding but my ability to clarify the statements. \nVideos didn't spend enough time explaining complex concepts forcing extra research as well.  This class is too easy. The problem with that is that they then take points off for things that 'Meet Expectations' according to the grading rubric, instead of taking points off because you actually did something wrong. I also think this class desperately needs a final exam to students can have some incentive to watch the lectures, as they are not really necessary to do the assignments.  It's a very easy class but it's extremly unorganized. You just need to know basic computer networking and very little python and you will be good to go.  Assignments are simple but quiz questions may be tricky. However, if you understand the material, quizes should be somewhat easy The material is good, but the assignments are far too easy. Some assignments are just step-by-step procedures that you need to run and observe. Others are programming assignments which require 1-10 lines of code.  This is Fall 2017. First project was hard but doable, second project was deadly hard. RPs are dry and boring. This is a python class more than a networking class (so far at least). Definitely not a newbie friendly class anymore... This is a course that teaches you how the internet works. Definitely isn't the \"easy\" class anymore as a lot has changed. This might be easy for some who have done this a lot of their lives, but others in this course were challenged or even frustrated. One probably has to have an intermediate knowledge of Python at least and then some networking background. It probably would be a better course if it felt a little more connected between parts and also had better materials in connection with the lectures. I'd say it's a medium since it's not as hard as others, but not the easy one past students remember.  This is the most disorganized course I have taken in the OMSCS program. There is no professor involved with the course at this point, so it is entirely run by a group of TAs who do their best to make everything work but don't have the resources, time, or authority to fix the aspects of the course that are broken. The course consists of lectures, which in general are interesting and easy to follow, short Python networking assignments, and quizzes. If all of these were integrated into the Udacity system as they were originally when the course was created, everything would be much easier to deal with. Instead, the current TAs are locked out of the Udacity backend and have to create their own autograding system and quiz questions from scratch. Autograding has been a mess, with students receiving zero scores for seemingly correct work with no explanation, such as programming assigningments where the code is completely correct or quiz submissions where there is an extra newline at the end of the file. The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it's a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material. All these issues mean that there is a large backlog of questions from students on Piazza, and the TAs have a hard time keeping up. To succeed in this course procrastination is basically mandatory, because critical clarifications and changes to the quizzes and assignments will often only be posted a few days before the deadline. Aside all of these issues, the material in the course itself is very approachable and the workload is very reasonable in terms of time. I wish the higher level staff would do something to address the problems faced by both students and TAs in this course, because otherwise I would recommend this course a good way to get started in the OMSCS program without getting overwhelmed by courses that involve more advanced skills and a larger time committment.  Coming off of a course where the professor was heavily engaged (CS6300 w/ Alex Orso) this course is a disappointment. AFAIK there is no professor supervising the TAs and there has been some snark on Piazza between the students and the TAs. (The majority of the students are probably older, and likely more experienced than the TAs, so that's a factor to consider. ) The quiz questions and answers are sometimes very cryptic, and some of the course communications aren't always written in proper English. Some of the quiz text appears to be plagiarized from other sources because the content is not covered in readings or lectures. I have printed the quiz out and kept it handy while watching lectures which basically makes it easy to ace most of the questions. The TAs are also sticklers for following the directions, but we had the same issue in CS6300... some people just don't follow directions. I am mostly satisfied, though, because these issues have not gotten in the way of my learning, and I have a pretty decent understanding of Python so the assignments are not that challenging.  The class is easy. The python assignments are easy- but there isn't much instruction on how to complete an assignment. I felt like the majority of the learning and how-to 'do stuff' came from using Google. The professor wasn't engaged in the course at all. Questions asked in the forums would simply go unanswered. I can 2nd that some of the quiz questions where plagiarized word-for-word from various places on the internet. In fact, one question was copied word-for-word - the answer from that site and the accepted answer in the class were different. I asked about this to a TA and his response was 'Sorry we can't pre-grade your quiz' and subsequent follow ups to clarify was left unanswered. Homework and quizes were not graded in a timely manner at all. I did learn stuff, but this didn't seem like a grad-level course.  The easiest course I have ever taken in my life... period. I wrote a total of 20 lines of code over the first 6 projects. The projects are mostly written, just have to add a few lines of code to get most of them to work. I have 3 projects left and I have a 102% in the class due to some extra credit given on one of the quizzes.  This was an OK class, but it could have been better. The lectures were interesting and covered a wide variety of topics, but didn't spend very much time on anything in particular. The 9 assignments and quizzes were not all that useful though to learning the course material. Many of the assignments really didn't have much to do with the corresponding lectures. The quizzes were poorly worded, ambiguous, and confusing. The provided virtual machine was a pain to use and sometimes I spent a couple hours trying to fix problems--my advice is to read, then re-read, and follow the assignment instructions exactly as written. Probably the hardest part of the course was learning Python which I had no knowledge of beforehand. It is somewhat easy class that could be taken along with a more difficult class.  It's a ridiculously easy class. You can literally watch all lectures and do all homeworks in a single (busy) weekend, which would make this a great choice for a Summer session. The software defined network bits at the end were interesting, but the bulk of the course would be better suited for a freshman-level intro to networking. Requires very little programming (just filling in a couple of lines here and there) and is a suitable course even for those with no prior Python experience.  Horrible class in terms of satisfication. But very popular among new students (myself included) because we don't know what to expect from gatech grad course so want to test the water with an easier class. The professor seems to be very aloof, and the course is entirely ran by teaching assisants who are not very attentive on the forum. Most of the help you get will be from fellow students, given the size of the class, I'd say you'll bound to find help from good students. The assignments are horribly designed and not well tested before deployment. The quiz questions are ambigous, causing a lot of frustration. The quiz are not difficult at all, Most of the admitted students are smart and will be able to comprehend the material in the video lecture easily. So imagine how they can design the multiple choice questions to test your IQ? They make them very ambiguous so you might just choose the wrong answer even you understand everything they taught just fine. in Fall 2014 80% of the student got an A. No mid term no finals, just 10 easy programming assignments + multiple choice questions. Just brush up on your python programming (you need to be able to read code from framework, you only need to write a few lines for each assignment). A great deal of the frustration you'll get is to understand the python mininet API framework, which is the center piece of every assignment but none of the lecture video cover the framework at all. Use a good editor like pycharm so you can jump to definition of the framework python code. That's all you need.  Same opinion as above. Great class to get started. TAs held lots of office hours so that helped. Programming assignments are easy as all the steps are basically provided within the instructions. No midterm or finals, just easy assignments. Could take you some time to get step up and running if you are not familiar with python. There is a VM provided though. May be a slight learning curve with the library, apis for those without a strong CS background The thing I liked most was that it required no group work. Everything was self directed and the assignemnts were pretty easy overall. The lectures went into pretty good detail about the content and were enjoyable to watch.  For the life of me, I cannot fathom why anyone would give this course a positive review. Perhaps they don't know what they are missing. Prior to this, I took 6220, 6290, and 8803-08 (HPC, HPCA, and Compilers) and found them all to be engaging and enjoyable. They were tough at times, but I felt it was time well spent. I learned a lot, and found the things I learned to be relevant and empowering. \n\n6250 was not of the same caliber by a large margin, and was very disappointing overall. If I had known then what I know now, there's no way I would have considered taking it.\n\n1) The content is poorly organized. There's little structure or hierarchy to the topics. It's a random smattering of things. \n2) The depth is shallow. The quizzes are inane.\n3) The assignments are either borderline trivial, or frustrating due to tricky technicalities.\n\nI don't fault the TA's or the instructor. I believe they are doing their best with what they were given. I think they have tried to make incremental improvements as time has gone on, but there really is no saving it. All the lectures and assignments should be thrown away and the course redesigned from scratch.  (Please bear with my spelling and Grammer) \nGreat course to Start of the OMSCS course. Projects are simple, but challenging enough to those who are coming back to college after 10 years and dont know the python. Video's are straight forward, sometime I had to listen multiple time to understand the concepts. Reading-papers were the toughest part of this course. For every week there are papaers and few papers are long also. \n\nOverall refreshing class for the ones who are going to start OMSCS after long time.  This is one of the first courses I took in OMS. Overall the course has been awesome. The course is very well structured and the projects have clear, well-written requirements. I would definitely recommend it to new students. MAJOR kudos to Head TA Stacia Stokes this semester for always going above and beyond and staying on top of everything! Only take this course if you're really interested in computer networking. The videos and research papers were interesting but were eclipsed by the poor management of the course by the TA's. Do not take this course your first semester. You will not a get a good impression of the program. I have taken four courses and the other three were superb (KBAI, AI for Robotics and Intro to Health Informatics). This class is not representative of the program.  Overall the course has its usefulness but not a good representation of what a Masters course should be like. I did learn more about specific topics during the lectures notes and they were somewhat necessary for some quiz questions. The programming can be tricky at times but none took more than 3 hours or so. The quiz questions are annoyance of this course. Not only are they ambigious and worded poorly, they often times had very deceiving (not tricky, but deceiving) questions. These deceiving questions will not only confuse the student but also may lead to a misunderstanding of specific topics when the answer key is released.  Agree with above. This class is potentially damaging to the program (Having taken 4 others, which were amazing). The lectures are ok (if not hard to follow due to the robotic speech of the instructor), but the assignments are awful. Each assignment is 1/2 coding & simulation, and 1/2 quiz. The quizzes were written by someone with absolutely no grasp of technical writing, or the English language in general. Project requirements were subject to change, and these changes weren't regularly stickied or announced. The coding required was extremely simple since most of the code is already written, and the hardest part is reading documentation. I would not recommend this course under any circumstances. If you want to learn about computer networks, you are better off watching the lectures and reading on your own.  I want to start off by saying that the Instructors for this course were top notch. They were quick with grades and responding to questions on Piazza and were very helpful. My review below is not a reflection of the Instructors, but solely the content and assignments for the course. \n\nI was quite disappointed in this course. The projects were simple and typically didn't require much effort assuming basic Python knowledge; Less than 2 hours each. I would've expected the projects to be more challenging considering my undergraduate Computer Networks class involved implementing a subset of functionality for an FTP server in C, given only the RFC document. The exams, of which there were 2, were typical memorize and regurgitate style with multiple choice and free response questions through ProctorTrack. \n\nThe content did not fit what I expected from a Computer Networks class. It seemed to be a hodge podge of select topics in the computer networking realm. I honestly didn't get much out of the class. \n\nIf you want an easy class and are ok with the typical memorize and regurgitate style of exams, then this is the class for you.  After watching the first couple of lectures, I was so looking forward to this class. The lectures have continued to be good, but the rest of the class experience has been a disappointment. I feel for the TAs - it seems like there has been ZERO involvement from the professor of record now that he's moved on to Princeton. The TAs are left holding the bag, and things have been very disorganized as a result. The programming assignments are almost laughably easy (I completed most in less than an hour), but the multiple-choice quizzes take a ridiculous amount of time. A lot of the questions are so incredibly vague or the answers just didn't make any sense - in some cases, there were no correct answers available, which was acknowledged by the TAs on the course forum. My general process for handling the quizzes was to watch the lectures, read any supplemental papers that were linked, read the Piazza forum, watch the office hours... and when all that failed, as it frequently did, Google for the answers. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 10-question multiple choice quiz can take upwards of 6 or 7 hours to complete. The Piazza forum itself is another issue... it's very frequently difficult to get any sort of 'official' response from a TA to questions. Students are helping each other as much as possible, but it would be nice to get official confirmation for questions that relate to policy/procedures. This is my first semester in the program, and I would have been really disappointed and questioning the caliber of the program if I weren't taking CS6300 concurrently.  Like has been said before, the content is reasonably interesting, but the execution of the quizes and assignments definitly has room for improvement. This may be the result of the loss of the professor though so hopefully it improves in the future. Video order seems to have been jumbled and no longer follows the ordering of assignments, it's not clear which lectures cover answers to questions for assignments, etc. Better organization and this would be a much better course.  If you want to get A with little to medium effort, this class is good. Some projects are fun and interesting (you need to know Python in advance, though) but some just require you to do some experiment and report your observation under unstable VM environment which is bit tough. There was even some bug in a given code and we had a hard time to get a result which we expected from the material. Exams are also tough (or at best, boring to prepare). It requires just tons of memorization.\n\nTo get A, secure full score for projects (60 points). Get an extra credit (you can get 5 points by participating some discussion threads). And try to get 60%+ for exams. You even don't need to watch video lectures or read most of papers for the grade.\n\nPersonally I wish I could have more experience on SDN through projects (implementation). This class is a good \"middle of the road\" for how classes should be at GT. Based off the reviews, I was expecting a really easy class that was a pain in the ass regarding quizzes. \n\nGuess what? Someone reads reviews. The quizzes are gone, but now the projects have a little bit more meat to them. The exams aren't terrible, but require you to actually do the reading (that's not a bad thing... ) and watch the lectures. \n\nMy only real complaint is it seems like some of the projects were in flight or being modified as we went. The last one was delayed due to issues for example and ended up being replaced. \n\nOverall I'd take this class. If you've had no exposure to Python (like me), it's a good way to get your feet wet. If you've had no programming experience at all? Some of the projects may be just a tad stressful. This is a good course for anyone that needs an introdcution to computer network modeling and simulation. The structure is slightly unorganized, probably due to the instrutor leaving gatech. Next semester maybe better organized. The office hours are helpful. Assignments are extremely easy. Please note you need to know how to program in Python, at least at a beginner level. All assignments are in Python. Quiz questions can be improved as the questions were ambiguous with multiple probable answers. Paper reading wokload was minimal. having said that, this course badly needs to be revamped and restructured.  The learning experience is not very enjoyable. Especially with poorly written quizzes and auto-grader for assignments. If you're looking for an 'easy' course and don't mind checking Piazza a few times every week, it may be a good choice. If you're very busy and have to skip piazza and TA sessions, you may be frustrated by this course.  This is a great course if you're interested in lots of details on how computer networks operate. My favorite parts were learning about the original design principles of the internet (since it was a department of defense project), and how TCP flows and congestion control work. I used to do a lot more backend work, and this class has given me some better background info on some of the projects I was working on. \n\nThe projects are a split between programming interview / competition style Python algorithms, and lab reports based on experiments conducted using a simulated network. The 2nd and 3rd projects are hard especially if you haven't had much programming experience. The lab report assignments can be very time consuming, since there's a lot of graphs to embed into google docs documents and explanations to give. The tests are moderatly difficult to hard, so make sure you study. The later readings really pile up, and can be fairly dense and dry. The lectures are great overall, but can be a little unclear in explanations. The professor has also been mostly absent during the course, and has only given us one or two office hour videos. Luckily, the best parts of the course have been the amazing student resources. The Brainscape flash cards, the test prep notes, and the great questions have really made the class a lot better. Our TA (Stacy Stokes) has done a really great job in posting weekly office hours answering questions to help explain projects. Piazza can be hit or miss, since there's a TON of threads, and it's hard to find important imformation even when threads are pinned. \n\nSummary: Recommended. If you're a solid programmer, this is a good first course to take. Easiest class I've ever taken. The projects didn't require much understanding, and there were no exams. You can even get away with not watching video lectures(though I'd recommend it as they teach a lot of things, those are just not tested) I would not take this course again. I did not watch the lectures, you don't need to. The asignments are easy but frustrating. I have taken 4 courses in OMSCS and CN was by far the easiest, and even so, the only one I almost got a B. Complete BS, it should be taken out of the curriculium.  The difficulty of this course will depend on your familiarity with Python. If you are unfamiliar, you should be able to catch up with a little extra work. Only a rudimentary knowledge of networking is necessary.  I really did not like this course. The lectures are poorly organized and the lecturer buries the lead a lot. The TAs were poorly organized and communication was extremely limited - there were so many unanswered, critical questions on Piazza. \n\nThe professor for the summer didn't even show up once. We were waiting for announcements that never came. The TA's favorite saying was, \"I'm still waiting to hear back from the professor\". \n\nThe test grading was absolutely ridiculous - the final was 30% of your grade and it was filled with multiple choice questions where the possible credit per question was 0, 0, 20, 60, or 100%. (5 multiple choice options, and any incorrect selections subtracted from your credit. This was true whether it was supposed to un/checked although the claimed purpose was to \"prevent people from clicking every option\" so not checking a box that was supposed to be checked still gets you marked off, which was stupid). So if you got 4/5 choices correct, you got 60% credit. 3/5 got you 20% credit. So stupid. \n\nThere are a TON of papers to read that have no relationship to the course except that the exams ask questions specific questions about them. \n\nI feel like too many people before said, \"This class is easy!\" so the professors/TAs decided to make things stupidly hard. I got an A on the final because I studied my ass off. I don't understand the need for rote memorization on things that don't matter, especially not for a meaningless exam that is 30%! of your grade, ESPECIALLY when there were questions that had absolutely nothing to the work we did in the course. \n\nI was very excited to take this course as it relates to personal interests, but this class was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews about the class being unorganized and I thought, \"Oh, they've got it figured out by now. \" No. They don't. Don't take this class. I believe that the class name should be changed to 'Network programming in Python'. I enrolled in the class assuming it is about computer networks instead it turned out to be a lot of programming in Python implementing switching and routing algorithms. I have nothing against the course but the name of the course doesn't convey the content of the course and it teaches very little about theoretical aspects of computer networks, which I was interested to learn. I am not a network programmer or python programmer so class did not do any good to me. TA's try their best to help students but people were overwhelmed that there was a lot of panic during projects. I would advise anyone to take a basic python class before taking up this class and don't be fooled it is not an easy course it will take hours and hours of your time if you are not used to implementing algorithms. Be prepared to be frustrated while testing your code you will not get it right easily. This was my first and only OMSCS course for Spring 2017. To put my review in perspective, I'm from EE background with little to no knowledge about computer networks prior to taking this class. I took an introduction to Python course on coursera as preparation. \n\nThe course was very well structured and the TAs (Michael Brown was just amazing) ran the show in an organized and timely manner. Professor rarely dropped by but her absence was never felt thanks to the TAs. Participation from peers on Piazza was the best part of the course. I was never stuck during the course as students quickly shared and proposed fixes for the issues they encountered. \n\nThe lecture videos were superficial and only provided an introduction to the topics. I found the reading material (papers and articles) to be quite helpful in my learning. Most of the projects were interesting. First three and last two projects required some programming in Python and I didn't find the coding hard. The remaining three projects were spoon fed through instructions and their main goal was to analyze the results and write reports. Tests included short answer and multiple choice questions and I found the difficulty level to increase from test 1 to test 3. A thorough understanding of lectures and reading material was sufficient and needed to score full on the tests. \n\nI highly disliked the weekly discussion threads where extra credit was offered for participation. Most of the students including myself posted just for the sake of it and didn't contribute to learning. It is a wonderful course. It gave a very good overall perspective about the networking. It's a great course that helps refresh basic networking concepts and introduces you to software defined networking. I had a lot of fun playing around with mininet. Stuff that you could only do with multiple pieces of hardware - you can simulate easily with mininet. \n\nFrom a difficulty perspective, this course was fairly easy. There are no exams, the quizzes are easy and the assignments moderately difficult. I didn't find anything challenging in this course, but the information was very useful none the less.  I found this course very easy, but I also find that I did not learn very much. Honestly not much at all except maybe a little Python and a few general concepts. The tests were very poorly worded and difficult, but I managed to get by with minimal effort. The lectures seemed to rush through material at times and were quite boring. The material is not very difficult however. Overall I would give the class a 3/5 as it was an easy A that meets a foundational requirement. If you are looking to actually learn a lot about computer networks, I would not bother with this course.  This was my first OMCS course and my day-job is in Network Engineering. So I consider myself better prepared than most for the course topics.\n\nFirst of all, like reviews from the summer semester, the course professor barely interacted at all. I recall an office hours for the first test and there was one set of discussion questions. The class was essentially ran by the Head TA, who did a fine job, but it was disappointing to miss that expert-level interaction. And for a course with 400+ students, that's quite an ask for the Head TA. \n\nIt will definitely help if you have some background in computer networking, especially in Part 1 of the course. Some fairly complicated networking topics are not explained with an appropriate level of detail. If you don't have the background on standard routing and switching technologies you'll likely need to do supplemental research to handle the first two projects. \n\nThe tests cover a lot of material and the questions are fairly subjective overall. It can be tough to know what the \"best\" answer is. Still, they aren't unfair and if you complete the test preparation questions you should be fine.\n\nSome reviews have characterized this course as \"Network Programming in Python\". This is hardly accurate. The course clearly lists at least an introductory level in Python is required. The first two projects are probably the hardest of the semester, but both can be completed with around 50 lines of code. The real challenge is in understanding the algorithm. The code itself requires nothing more than the ability to use variables, follow control logic, and pass messages, all capabilities learned in any introductory computer science course. The undergraduate networking course required implementations in C, and those projects were much more time-consuming then anything found here.\n\nOverall, I recommend the course to anyone interested in Computer Networks as an operational discipline. If you just want to know how to write networking code as an applications developer, this course isn't for you. This was a challenging but very enlightening course. The practical projects are decent (5 of them) but the three paper projects are a total waste of time. The exams are a bit more challenging than necessary -- they could benefit from being substantially longer so that individual questions aren't worth so much. \n\nI'm quite experienced in Networking and this course was pretty easy for me. It explores some neat concepts on the cutting edge of Networking research though, so if you don't have a strong foundation in the fundamentals coming in you'll have to spend a lot of time catching up. It's just about right in terms of difficulty for a Masters' level class, I think. I don't know why this is a class. I had harder lab assignments in undergrad than the assignments in this class. The assignments are largely copies of mininet/pox/pyretic tutorials and require almost no coding or critical thinking. The most consistent student complaint has been that the quizzes are incredibly ambiguous, and the expected answer from lecture may directly contradict the result of performing the experiment in mininet... just because.  This course is an easy A if you have inexhaustible patience.\n\nThe \"professor\" is AWOL.  If you ask me her name in a year, I'll have forgotten it.\n\nThe head TA is combative and easily frustrated.\n\nThe course lectures are shallow and poorly organized--a hodgepodge of unrelated topics.  There is no book.  The journal articles are dry but at least somewhat interesting.\n\nThe programming projects are usually broken.  Some have suggested that this is a Python debugging course first and a networking course second.  They are correct.\n\nThe writing projects are easy 100s.  If you find yourself unable to reproduce the desired experiment results, don't sweat it.  The project code is probably broken (again). I thoroughly enjoyed this class. You don't really need a background in Networking to jump into it. You will need to be familiar with Python and understand algorithms to an extent. For the Python skills you can take Udacity's Intro to Algorithms course which I had gone through only about a third of its material but it was enough for me to be able to successfully complete the projects that required a better Python understanding. There were 8 projects in total. The instructor was considerate that in some cases a student may have trouble reaching a solution, so for everyone assignment credit is explicitly given for turning something in that shows you had at least put forth some effort. \n\nThe exams were pretty challenging but the grading was fair. They were a mix of multiple choice and short answer. Multiple Answer Multiple Choice questions seem to be a theme throughout many of Georgia Tech's courses. Thankfully in this course they weren't all or nothing. Just be sure to only mark the ones you know or are pretty confident in and you'll likely reduce the damage. For test prep I would suggest focusing on understanding the topics covered in the study guides provided by the instructor. Then you can go over the test prep questions and solutions that were also provided. The professor was good about including the topics you should look over to be successful on the exams. I took this class because I wanted to take a semester 'off' from the intensity of other courses in this program. It did not disappoint for how easy it was, but this class is an embarassment to the program. The quizzes are poorly worded, so they're a little hard to answer, but just do some googling and make your best guess - the TAs will regrade them with looser restrictions on the answers and then you'll probably get a hundred percent. The assignments are basically extremely simple tutorials. You don't even have to watch any of the lectures and you can still be very succesful (grade wise) in this course. I literally cannot remember the last time I took such a poor rigour-free class (even in high school). The lectures are decent, and you can learn something if you take the time on it, but learning is not a requirement for this one.  Zero involvement whatsoever from the professor all semester. So far as I can tell, she has only held office hours one or two times and posted in Piazza a similar number of times. The quality of the assignments has huge variance; I found some of the assignments interesting and did feel like they taught me something about networking (an area in which I have no previous experience). Others, though, have a number of issues ranging from poor descriptions, poorly written and formatted provided code, and just being a huge waste of time. Grading for the homework is sometimes nonsensical as well. Some of the lectures are good, others are insufficient to explain the material with the level of detail appropriate for a course at this level. Exams are difficult and not conducive to real learning. I'm on track to get an A, but feel like I've learned much less than I feel like I should have. \n\nThe course was able to succeed at all only because of huge commitment and involvement from the head TA (Stacia Stokes), who is excellent. Not recommended for those who are considering this only as an elective. Overall, this was a good class. I learned many basics about Computer networking and most of the papers were interesting. The projects were good and the TAs were very helpful through out the course. I'm giving this one a hearty \"meh\". I actually got more out of reading the recommended background text (Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach) than I did out of the course itself. The projects are a joke; a couple hours a piece. The final project was 7 lines of code. So, you'll knock those out quickly, especially with help from your Piazza buddies. The tests I had a mixed experience with. I thought the first was pretty easy and the homeworks prepared you for it. The second I thought deviated quite a bit from the homeworks. Since it's closed book and you get just 2 hours, I was screwed on that one. I wish they made it clearer what topics will be on the test. Also, there were only two tests during the semester. I think there should be at least 3 or 4, so you're not just cramming bits of knowledge in your brain only to forget them later.  With a background in Telecom and networking, I think this course is not too far behind with whats going on in the industry. There are certain aspects missing like may be a touch up of cloud, and it sometimes clings on too much on very old stuff, which no one uses in industry like TCP basics etc. \n\nThere are 2 things I disliked. The tests and TA interaction. The tests are usually MCQs and are taken straight from the text of some papers. In real world, no one remembers the whole texts of paper, which the tests sometime are trying to judge. \n\nMy experience with TA and professor interaction wasn't great. I am not sure about other students, but I didn't get too much response from them. Very flexible schedule. Either have some programming skill, or brush up on it first. Will require extremely short bits of programming with likely unfamiliar domain specific commands. Did not know any Python and basically know about 3 commands in Linux. Could probably have done most weeks faster, but it is clearer if you pay good attention to the lectures and articles. Most assignments are demonstrations of the topics in the lectures or articles (at least if you paid enough attention to what was going on). Basically, you must be able to read well, listen to lectures, and have moderate general troubleshooting/debugging ability.  It was a very easy class. I didn't know Python prior but I do have experience with Unix/Perl. You basically modify Python code and it is fairly easy to infer the syntax by the code given. It wouldn't hurt to brush up on Python though before hand. I think it was a bit fun as well. I also liked the videos but like others, they aren't really required for the assignments.  This is a great class to take in addition to another. The videos were entertaining, and informative. Because the grade was based entirely off of projects, I found myself able to enjoy them more. I found the projects to be very easy, despite having minimal knowledge of python.  It's good class for computer networks. Its not an easy class, even with programming background, you have to spend time doing projects and reading lots of papers. This is the only class I have B on after taking 6 classes. Professor did not do much except for checking in on Piazza once a while, did not bother to reply email, run by the head TA and he seems pretty stingy with regrades even when there were mistakes on the grading, always came up with something to deny the cause, and once even said something so wrong, I could only laugh. On top of that I was accused of using pen and paper while taking the exam, and penalized, which I did not, and cant be seen on video either, while people using headphones were let by, quite unfair, never happened before on any tests. So I guess depends on whom are you taking the class with. For one of the projects, the other TA leading was on top of it. The class itself was pretty useful especially for someone like me with almost zero network experience/knowledge. I felt like the papers gave a lot of extra coverage on the topics and provided much more depth than the lectures themselves. The projects have been updated from previous semesters from what I've seen and this is for the better. \n\nGrading-wise, there were 8 projects and 3 tests. The tests were made up of MCQ, true/false and some short answer (except the last test). Nothing seems to be set in stone so keep this in mind when preparing for the tests. Attending the office hours were very useful. The head TA at the time, Michael, really saved this class! The professor for the semester was really hands off. It appears she was mostly busy with other things and so we didn't get to see her much (she didn't hold weekly office hours). \n\nNote that the papers will take time to read and comprehend so if you're taking this class, try and get ahead of the readings. There's an optional textbook which I found really helpful in supplementing my overall understanding. Any review you see on this course more than a year old you can ignore, because the course changes a LOT. The reviews here were deceiving for me. This was my first OMSCS course - I am an intermediate Python programmer at best, with a decent networking background and no real major programming background. This course was challenging without being too bad. Some weeks I spent 20-30 hours, some weeks less than 5. More of the former though. \n\nThere were 8 projects for 60% of your grade, which alternated between pretty challenging (coding wise) to more read/report which were interesting but easier. If you have a significant coding/Python background you have a big advantage, but otherwise they will push you. There is a lot of reading: academic papers, book, and background that took up a chunk of time I did not expect. \n\nThe course is a really good course, especially for a first one in OMSCS. Konte as a professor was great with feedback, Michael Brown as a head TA was great on that as well. The rest of the TAs, Michael, and Maria Konte were simply fantastic overall. Incredibly responsive on Piazza. \n\nThe tests are 40% of your grade. Although Test 1 was pretty random and not super representative of the material, Test 2 and Test 3 were much better - challenging but very fair. Just do not think you are walking into an easy A. \n\nOverall the course was great! I learned a lot, and feel like a stronger Python programmer. This is the only course in which I finished with a literal 100%, not a point missed the entire time. We got ten chances on each quiz, so even though the questions were fairly vague, answer the ones you know first, then build up incrementally answering a few more on each try to see where you're wrong. I kind of hate the quiz structure that rewards gaming like that, but given the chance, why wouldn't you? They're giving you free 100s if you approach it correctly. \n\nMy experience was improved by taking this at the same time I took Prof Feamster's SDN course on Coursera. This was by far the most interesting part of the course for me and it really hammered home all of the layers beneath Pyretic that we just kind of gloss over in the Georgia Tech course. It also gave a whole bunch of extra progamming assignments and exposure to some newer technologies that improve upon Pyretic or expand its capabilities. Overall, the course is far too easy on its own, but the material itself is very interesting and if you dig a little deeper and do some extra work on your own, you can still get just as much out of it as you get out of the more stand-alone challenging courses. Do the mininet and OpenFlow and Pyretic tutorials on each project's website and understand what these technologies are doing, ahead of when it comes up in the course.  Background:\nThis is my first course in the OMSCS program and I intentionally took this course for two reasons.  First, I was interested in learning more about computer networks.  Next, from reviews on OMSCentral, this seemed to be on average one of the easier courses, so it provided a good stepping stone into the program.  I have an aerospace degree and have worked in the world of defense software for about 4 years now.\n\nPros:\n- The head TA (Stacia Stokes) is very attentive and present on Piazza.  Two thumbs up here.\n- Each project has enough time to complete.\n- The lectures, articles/readings, and projects do tie together for the most part.\n- You do learn a lot about both the historical and modern concepts of network programming.  They don't go too deep, but that's mainly because there is a lot of ground to cover.\n- Two instances of extra credit were offered (one for weekly discussions, another for an extra portion of the last project)\n\nCons:\n- The articles were difficult to read through.  Interesting topics, but the important points were buried in the article (typical techincal paper...).\n- The lecture videos can be a bit jumpy in its explanations, though it still holds to the overall lecture topic.\n- I had hoped to do a little more with software-defined networks (SDN's)\n- Projects 2 and 3 were intense (but if you get past those, you'll be fine.)\n- Test questions could sometimes be vague, and thus difficult to answer.\n- ProctorTrack may be more of a pain than it's worth.\n\nOverall I'm happy with this course.  I recommend it as a first course for anyone starting the program without a network background.  This course uses Python, so you'd benefit from already knowing it, but that's not a necessity.  Time spent each week really varied and depended on the project.  I probably spent time more than I needed to, so take that into account for the \"weekly workload\" stat. Having experience with Python, I found the projects very easy. Like some others, too easy. But I did learn from them. \n\nThe concepts actually helped me for work, though I felt like we didn't go in depth enough in some areas. \n\nThe quizzes were often worded in ways that made them more difficult than they should have been.  Very easy class. Interesting material. Programming assignments were in Python. First assignment was the hardest one. Subsequent assignments were way easier. The programming assignments gave you most of the code and had TODO comments on where you had to write a line or two.  This is your warning: steer clear of this class. If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar. \n\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn't inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well. \n\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course. \n\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are \"select all of the correct responses\" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy \"1 quick quiz per week or two\" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option. \n\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren't able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines. \n\nI'll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was \"take this if you want an A\" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments. \n\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn. \n\nKeep in mind that I'm currently scoring in the 85%+ range. I put in a lot of time for this class. I wish I could have invested that time elsewhere.  I have been working in the networking industry since 2002 developing networking applications and protocol stacks. In spite of the experience, I learned loads from this class - especially on the L3 side. The projects are fun, and shouldn't be a problem if you know Python (an absolute must for this class). The TAs and Prof. are super active in Piazza and Office Hours are also conducted twice in a week. \n\nThis course requires reading of published papers apart from video lectures (which I found not rich in details - might be a problem for students not exposed to networking concepts earlier from school / work). There are 2 closed-book proctored tests involving a plethora of multiple choice, descriptive-types, and problem-types questions. It is important to internalize the concepts mentioned in the papers and video lectures if you want to do well in the tests.  After taking 6300 in the Fall, which was very well run, I can only echo the comments of those above who found this iteration of the course disorganized and not postively representative of the kind of execution that I was expecting. The material was interesting, and the lectures with the now departed Prof. Feamster were well done, but what #61 said about the quizes was very true and very disappointing. I'm also going to suggest that perhaps the class was too large to be effectively managed, and perhaps 200-300 students should be the max on a course at the graduate level given the time commitments of not only the students, but also the TAs involved. Having more TAs doesn't necessarily solve all issues that arise from such a large class in a variation on the maxim of the mythical man-month.  Because I am interested in the subject matter and quite familiar with computer networking, I spent time understanding the material and overall I enjoyed the course. The video lectures were good; the research papers were a must read - especially for the quizes. The course covered some material like SDN which was a good introduction. The python programming itself was not difficult, but you did have to spend time understanding the concepts and the other code with which you were interfacing. Even though I felt like I knew the answers on the quizes, the quizes took extra time because of the ambiquity of the wording on some of the questions. In general, what was required for the course was clearly spelled out but there were some oddities (like the quiz naming mentioned above). For this course, the student and TA conversations on Piazza were a must read. I only had a couple of direct interactions with the TAs and my questions were quickly resolved.  Class is around average difficulty with some booby traps (2 that semester) along the way that ramp up difficulty for brief periods in the semester, which can take you by surprise and kill your grade if you are not prepared (e. g. starting a project late because you think it might be easy like some of the others and not thoroughly looking at corner cases of your solutions that are not easy or obvious to see even with some effort in doing so). Class was well run and the grade distribution for projects and test was done fairly. Only thing I did not like was the extra credit for discussion threads where many people added fluff that didn't contribute to learning just to gain extra credit and half the time others feeling like we didn't have much to contribute to the value with all the 'noise' in those discussion threads. Otherwise I would highly recommend this class. I learn't a lot and it was a good introduction to the program! This class was way too easy. Interesting content, but the assignments were really simple and could be done without even watching the lectures. Assignments were largely just using some pre-existing code and filling 1-2 lines. No midterm or final. I feel like there should have been 50% more content in this course, and harder, more interesting assignments.  It's not a good sign when a TA calls a test question \"ridiculously counter-intuitive\", and comments that he too would have chosen the incorrect answer. \n\nIf you are intent on thoroughly learning the material presented in this course, beware: Your grade (especially your test grades) may not reflect your knowledge. A large portion of your time will be spent trying to figure out semantics of obscure test questions, troubleshooting faulty project templates, and arguing with instructors. \n\nIt is true the content of this course does not demand a large number of hours per week to read or watch. However, the open-book format of the tests is IN NO WAY an advantage. The \u201cselect all that apply\u201d multiple-choice scheme was deemed unfair by MANY students, mostly because of the way T-Square deducts points for incorrectly selected options. Watching the lecture videos, reading the papers, and even participating in office hours do NOT lay the path for scoring well on the tests. \n\nThe projects can be a good source of learning the material, despite the fact they are 80% reading instructions and looking over the supplied templates and 20% actually writing code. \n\nIn the Fall 2015 session, the instructors were mostly attentive to students\u2019 concerns (via Piazza and office hours), even if some answers included \u201cthat\u2019s just the way it is, it cannot be changed. \u201d (This was a common response referring to tests in T-Square). I think the instructors were probably doing the best they could with the atrocious class they were given. However, I doubt any of them would have tolerated the mishaps we students had to deal with. \n\nCONCLUSION: This class needs to be scrapped and totally redone. Both the original content and the delivery of that content are atrocities to the OMSCS program. As stated below, this class IN NO WAY does justice to this VERY important field of Computer Science. If you decide to take this class, and learning the material and scoring well is important to you, PREPARE TO BE THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATED.  I found the reviews for this class deceiving. This is NOT an easy class. For someone with not much prior Networking experience, The only way to ensure an A is through consistent hard work. Not having programmed for a while or unfamiliarity with Python could easily take your overall grade under 90%. Overall, although there was the occasional video, where concepts were smudged over, very good quality of lecture! The papers were not an easy read, but pay off with knowledge in the end! I learned a lot in this class. Just don't underestimate it, it is not a walk in the park. Cheers! The reading was interesting, the projects were very simplistic and quick, but did not prepare me adequately for the tests. Based on the complexity of the projects, I didn't study enough for the tests and didn't do as well as I would have liked. My recommendation is to study all the reading and lectures thoroughly for the week leading up to the tests. The lectures breezed over some topics too quickly and seemed too brief, especially comparing this class against Computer Vision which had an awesome and thorough lecture component.  Standard lectures, content itself isn't terribly hard to follow. Projects each had their pain-points. About 3 of the projects were bigger and took 10 or so hours while the rest were smaller projects that each took maybe 5. The head TA was essentially the only point of contact for this class, and with that considered she did a great job... but... the projects NEED improvement. Simple things wasted hours of time for everyone in the class and understandably I think they started to get short towards the end of the course which didn't help. All in all, like most classes, the learning happens in the projects (for better or for worse). Not recommended. You need to finish three boring reports in the middle of the semester(although you can definitely earn full credits). The exams are very boring.  If you know Python you should be fine. Lectures are interesting and worth taking with a harder class to balance out the workload You can answer the quizzes without going over lectures. And each of the assignments are not more than 25 to 50 lines. The lecture material was really good. If someone is really interested in networking, then this is the right class. But with Prof. NF moving to Princeton, I am not sure how its going to be handled. Definitely the easiest of classes in OMSCS.  Took this as my first OMSCS course, and first foray into Python programming. Programming assignments are very simple, if you see the clever way to do it. For our semester, Assignment 3 was the most challenging assignment, but most others were very simple - adding/changing Python code to make the VM Network simulator perform a specified task. A very gentle introduction to the OMSCS program.  I really enjoyed this class. It helped me develop a good understanding of networking and I thought Prof Lillethun and the TAs did a really good job. I got a pretty high mark in this class (97), so I thought I would share a couple of tips that might help others that are planning to take it:\n\n1. As mentioned in the other reviews, some of the questions on the quizzes can be vague and easily misinterpreted. My approach on the quizzes was to make sure I researched each question throughly, considered all possible interpretations, and if necessary, post a private message to the Instructors requesting clarification. I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things. \n\n2. Use office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it. \n \n3. In advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them. \n\n4. T-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don't gamble on choices that you aren't sure of. \n \n5. T-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer. \n\n6. The projects aren't very hard, but you do need to have *some basic* programming. experience. If this isn't you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program). Prepare for the class by learning how to use basic data structures (maps, lists, sets), write methods, and declare variables. This is basic stuff, but a number of people seemed unprepared.  The security aspect of this course is very interesting. Knowledge of python is a must. There were papers to read each week, which were very in depth about the material covered while the lectures would barely scratch the surface. Overall, this is a great course. Pretty easy A perfect course to start the program. All the assignments are due during the weekend which is a big plus. Once you have basic knowledge of networks, the class becomes more interesting. Otherwise some effort needs to be put to get the basics right. You will learn more from the piazza discussions and the assignments. The papers are worth reading and some are a bit boring too. To crack the exams, the video lectures and the reading papers are clearly understood as sometimes the MCQs can confuse you. A fun class where you will learn and enjoy networks. Good course if you want to learn about computer networks. Very good videos, projects are okay, and tests are good too. \n\nProjects - 60%. All projects are good and doable in few hours - but you have to spend a lot more to make sure that you don't make a typo / small mistake. A small mistake in any of the project means that you lost \"A\" grade... My suggestion will be that if you are looking for \"A\" - make sure that you spend those extra hours to iron out any issues. \n\nTests are closed book. So, that's a bummer - I haven't done closed book written test in a while. But then closed-book tests are more helpful retaining the concepts. For both tests - I studied for 3 days straight and took exam at the end of 3rd day - 3 days were enough. \n\nVideos are good and helpful. Extra readings are boring and elaborate - but you don't need to read everything - you need to focus on key concepts. \n\nOffice hours were useful and I spent time watching all of them offline. The discussions in office hours will give you tips for your projects and help u out with key concepts on tests. \n\nGood course overall - definitely recommended. The only concern is that you are more worried about loosing the points than earning points.  I'll echo many of the previous Fall 2015 comments. The material itself isn't that difficult but is interesting, at least to me since I have a software development background. However, the tests are extremely vague and confusing often covering topics that are only hinted at in the videos. The projects seem to make sense but if your code fails one of the unreleased tests, you don't get any sort of feedback so you can't go back and understand what you did wrong. In addition, the schedule is constantly changing as assignments and tests have been released late and grades often take 3+ weeks to be released. Overall, it's a VERY frustrating course.  An interesting course that takes you behind the scenes of the networks that we use all day every day. It's a bit less practical than I thought it would be, but also deeper into the design decisions and choices that were made in the development of the Internet. The exercises are pretty straightforward, and so far follow two patterns: a step-by-step project using a network simulator were you are finding/learning stuff, or short coding exercises (in Python) to write some of the algorithms that run on routers/controllers. You don't have to be a real Pythonista, as you can pick it up along the way. The TA's are active on Piazza, and the course seems to be a well-run machine at this point -- no weird project surprises. The recorded lectures are a bit disjoint on occasion and not as clever/elaborate as some of the more recent courses, but they get the job done. My Background: CS Undergrad, 3+ years industry experience in Software Development, No Networking undergraduate class. \n\nProjects 60%. Each project is very easy if you have decent programming experience in Python or a similar language. To be honest, I felt like they were too easy (though I did learn something from most of them). Be sure to do well on the projects so that you have some room to not do so well on the tests. \n\nTests 40% I studied 20+ hours for both tests, but much of that was catching up on lectures I had fallen behind on. Before the curve, I got B's on the tests (A's after the adjustment). From what I understand, the Spring 2016 offering was the first to incorporate 2 tests whereas previous semester had quizzes. Be warned, from what I can tell, these tests are much harder than those quizzes ever were. The tests did not cover anything that wasn't in the lectures/homework/papers, but they covered a vast amount of content. Take good notes on the lectures AND study them and you should be fine. \n\nHomeworks: The homeworks are optional but not optional if you want to do well on the tests. \n\nPapers: There were several academic papers for us to read. They varied in difficulty, but a couple of them were very long. However, the tests and the projects didn't seem to test our knowledge of them very extensively (other than what was in the homeworks). \n\nLectures: These are good, but they are not very consistent in the amount of detail covered. Some topics are covered in much detail while others are not. It would be nice if each one had optional readings associated with them. The are very few difficult concepts presented in the class. \n\nOverall Thoughts: Having never taken an undergraduate networking course, I felt like I learned a good bit in this class. The class really isn't that hard. I felt like it was worthwhile for me.  I think knowing Python will help a lot, since most of the assignments were in Python. If you study the materials, the quizzes are straight forward. I got to learn about SDN, and it was very interesting.  Overall an enjoyable course. Comparing to the reviews from previous semesters, it seems evident that there's been an effort made to make the course more rigorous and difficult. The projects have been beefed up, there are three tests, and something like 10 to 15 dense papers you have to read. I really enjoyed most of the projects, while I found the papers to be excessive. The current head TA, Michael, essentially runs the course and he's on top of it. With just a few exceptions the timeliness of grading and responses on Piazza was top notch. This was my first OMSCS course. My background is in Civil/Environmental Engineering, so I did not have any previous knowledge in computer networks. I did not take any classes in preparation for the course. However, I did have some very light Python experience. The programming portions of the course were fairly basic, even for a novice programmer such as myself. Brushing up on python syntax and data structures should be enough to complete the projects. \n\nBe prepared to spend a lot of time on Piazza asking questions and reading your classmates posts, as the instructions given in the lectures and projects may at times be vague or difficult to understand. The instructors generally do a very good job at responding to questions. \n\nThe tests vary in difficulty. I found the first test to be the easiest with the following test increasing in difficulty. The tests are provided in ProctorTrack and you are given a two hour window to complete them. However, all of them can easily be completed in under an hour. \n\nBetween the lectures, papers, and projects a lot of information is thrown at you. Some stuck and a lot did not, but I still learned a good deal. Overall, I would highly suggest this course if you are a new student. It is highly structured and requires little base knowledge, allowing you to ease into the OMSCS program. Just be prepared to do the work and allocate some time to study before the tests. I give it neutral for several reasons. \n1. The course material itself is interesting - If you don't know in detail how internet works and nothing about traffic engineering, security issues, what is a cluster etc this is a good course to learn. It assumes you know undergrad networking knowledge (which i do not have) so there is a bit of learning curve\n\n2. Second project is difficult - You need to know algorithm for this. I did not know and got 60/130\n\n3. Lectures - My goodness this is the most difficult part. Content isn't bad but delivery needs improving\n\n4. TAs- My class TAs were amazing. held the courses together and responded fast and with respect. Kudos to Kelly Parks (head TA) and other TAs with her. \n\n5. Professor - Promised discussions for extra credit but didn't deliver. Gave 5% boost to everyone at the end but you could have just said you were going to do that from the beginning. Not sure why you had to make everyone anxious until the last week of the class\n\n6. Exams - Only multiple choice. Not sure why it was formatted like this. It was helpful to get your grades fast but I would have appreciated bit more free form answer discussion. I guess the classes were too big? not sure\n\nOverall not a bad course if you want to learn about networking. I do wonder what the opportunity cost is though. You should think about whether you REALLY want to learn networking or not. If you think this is a blow off class like it used to be, it's not. Prepare to put in 10-15 hours of work It is definitely going to take you much more hours that written here. I took this as my first course and regretted the decision. The assignments are hard (the first assignment was an exception, rest were very hard). I had taken because of the ratings here and now I know not to trust just the ratings here. For anyone who is planning on taking this, please strengthen your basics on Computer Networks, and for sure make sure that you are very comfortable with algorithms and coding, because that is what you are going to need the most. The lecture videos are poorly structured and defined. For most of the topics, you will have to spend quite some time doing research on your own, which is still manageable. Overall, beware of the assignments; you are going to need to spend way more time on those. Quizzes were made unnecessarily difficult. The projects were informative and a bit on the easy side. Overall, I think I learned a good bit in this course.  Disappointingly easy - the assignments are next to pointless. Looking forward to seeing the class advance with a new professor.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. This will never happen again, as the program is changing with a new prof on the BOOK s.  I think the above covers the course pretty well: Lectures are great, labs are really easy. My only other addition is that there is a frustrating aspect to the quizes and labs: When you don't understand the wording of a question, there's rarely help availailable to clarify the answer. Typically you'll be met with a response of 'I can't tell you more because it would give away the answer, but you're on the right track. ' It's very difficult to get clarification on quiz questions.  I have mixed feelings about this course. Overall, I was disappointed with the professionalism of this course and it did not meet my expectations for OMSCS. On the positive side, in the first part of the course, the lectures provide a good graduate level introduction to networking. The rest of the course deals mostly with Software Defined Networking. Here, the lectures are ok. But the 'lab' part of the assignments really need to be reworked-they are not challenging and often involved mindlessly following step by step instructions. Also on the negative side, the quizes were poorly written, not particularly challenging and often contained errors. TAs were slow to return quizes and there was a 'negotiation' on piazza after a quiz was graded, and then the quizes were regraded. With some exceptions, Piazza discussions were not great and TA responses were often no more than a couple of words.  After 20 years working in non-cs field, this was a great course for my first semester. It allowed me to learn the basics of python, to get familiar with Linux and to ease into the rhythm of studying every day without it being too stressful. The Head TA did a fantastic job keeping Piazza organized with weekly posts and office hours. All assignment and test grades were returned within 2 weeks. The Instructor did some office hours around the first test but sort of checked out after that. The 2nd and 3rd assignments were the most challenging of the 8. I have a much better understanding of various network protocols and their limitations. I definitely learned a lot in this course. A good survey course on networks. Is conducted really well. The research papers which are a part of the course are the best part of the course. \n\nWith 8 projects, 17 papers and 3 exams this course can be a little hectic at times People should know this is NOT the easy class that past reviews says it is! The course apparently has gone through a lot of changes. There are 8 projects and often times take a lot of time to complete, and the tests can get tricky if you don't completely know and understand the material. The material in general is not tricky, but there is a lot to remember and the papers can be dense and hard to read. \n\nOverall I learned a lot from the class, I'd say it's medium/hard difficulty, but don't think this is an easy class that you can pair with a more difficult class. You will definitely be spending hours on each homework and even more studying the material. \n\nI will say you do come out of this class understanding a lot, like the internet, how it works, how it's connected, the nuances, etc. It's a class that I think is very useful and will teach you a lot. This is my only class that I have not gotten an A in and it was mostly because I couldn't figure out how they were testing. I got 68%, 61% and 74% and that drug me down to 88% for the class. But, this was more because of my limited knowledge going into the course about networking. I did learn a TON and would recommend this course. I recommend this as a very good first course to start off your OMSCS journey. The course is well structured with engaging lectures and content. You are encouraged to read up on additional material and the quizzes too are good. The projects are based on SDN with Python as the language and were interesting. In fact, this course gives you a good foundation to explore lots of interesting areas in networking. I enjoyed taking this course.  The instructors were great, the TAs were great. Quick to respond to issues and were very active on Piazza. The 6 projects were pretty straight forward and didn't need more than a few hours each to complete. The language of choice is python. I didn't know python going in, and it was easy to pick up, so don't worry if you don't know it before hand. The course seems to have changed format from before. Now there are 2 exams, roughly corresponding with midterm and final. There is probably about 7-10 academic papers to read. The video lectures are from the old format, and don't match up well with the projects or papers. The video lectures also tend not to explain things well or thoroughly. I found myself on multiple occasions going to wikipedia to look up topics in order to understand them better. Fairly easy class.  Overall, good and pretty easy class. Lectures are informative, interesting, and well constructed. Weekly readings are not too long, fairly interesting. First few projects are excellent, they match up well with the lectures and readings, and they drive home concepts. Projects toward the end are more about understanding configuration options than understanding core networking concepts. This was my second course after having taken Software Analysis and Test in my first semester. \nThe course was interesting with a number of papers required to read. The assignments were doable and the tests were multiple choice which tested the content(lectures and papers) quite fairly.\n\nI'd recommend this as a first course given the great amount of help and active participation on Piazza(especially by the Head TA Stacia). It provides a great welcome into the program. You'll enjoy it more if you also have little networking experience. The content is great as a introduction to the Networking world. I figure a veteran in the OMSCS or Computer Networking wouldn't find it engaging though(unless you're doing it for the relatively easier A :-) )\n\nGreat class overall though. Helped me learn quite a bit on networking concepts which I had no prior knowledge of and polish up on my quite rusty Python skills. \n\nAnd I must say the TAs do a great job given how large the class can get.  Great Work on that front!! I found programming assignments very difficult as a python novice, and would not have been able to complete them at all were it not for the helpful discussions by fellow students. That wasn't for lack of programming expertise - I know how to program, and how to google. It was the lack of direction for how assignments should be structured that caused me problems. Tests were ridiculously vague and poorly phrased, requiring me to guess what the instructors had in mind rather than demonstrate my knowledge (I read AND watched all videos, practice questions and answers, office hours, etc. ) To be clear: I'm getting a strong A, and I really enjoyed the course material. I just feel that there were parts of this course that were made unnecessarily difficult for the wrong reasons.  Memorize and follow the rails. \n\nRead a bunch of papers (granted, they're mostly interesting) and watch a few shallow lecture videos. Do a few \"projects\", some of which require programming watered-down versions of standard algorithms, and some of which are just step-by-step tutorials on how to configure some network service (and write a report -- \"What did you see when you typed run. sh?\"). The ONE open-ended part of the class was to be weekly discussions on Piazza with the prof. These never happened. More on that below. \n\nIt was very poorly run. The prof (MK) never showed up after the first week. Not once. This might be OK in another class, but it meant that we didn't get any of the open-ended, research-oriented interaction promised in the syllabus. It also meant that the TAs floundered. They kept saying, \"I emailed the prof and I'll let you know what I hear. \" On the rare occasion the TAs were able to reach the prof, she made more false promises about when she'd show up. Prof hung the TAs out to dry, along with the entire class. The TAs made effort for the first half of the course, but by the end, most Piazza questions about the material went unanswered -- even the ones asking for guidance on errors in the test prep materials. \n\nThe exams were multiple choice and T/F with lots of ambiguity. In higher education, there's often some ambiguity, and you write about it and address it. In a multiple-choice exam, however, there is no opportunity to address the ambiguity! The tests are written using language that can be interpreted in multiple ways, and I never knew whether I was overthinking a sloppily-written question or if it was a trick question. Both types (sloppy and trick) are on the exam. I managed to do pretty well, but that was by careful deconstruction of the test author's psyche. Or guessing. \n\nRead the papers, watch the videos, and follow the tutorial projects like a monkey. You do need some skill turning basic algos into code, and luck on the exams. This was my first OMSCS class, so I went in not knowing what to expect. For the most part, all of the other reviews for this class seem to be correct. The workload was not bad, there were projects, reading scholarly papers and tests. The TAs seemed very helpful and of course, the other students in the class helped each other learn. \n\nI don't have any negative comments from this class, but for those interested in this class the following should be considered: Don't get behind reading the scholarly articles. The exams cover these and can significantly impact your grade. Second, make flashcards. The tests cover some detailed stuff, so good study practices are necessary. Finally, try to give yourself a weeks worth of margin on assignments. Challenge yourself to get assignments turned in a week early. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this class and would take it again. I really liked the course and the accompanying projects (very easy python stuff, even though I'd never used python before). Tests were boring and unnecessary since then didn't really teach me anything, but they were a big part of the grade.  Continuing with the theme, this class was not easy. The papers are absolutely ridiculous and I ended up skipping most of them. \n\nPros: \nLearned some interesting things about networking. \nProjects are python based\nThe course VM was pretty nice to develop in\n\nCons: \nPractice tests contain only a portion of the content contained in tests\nPapers are terrible\nTests contained content only BRIEFLY touched on in lecture videos\nI was deducted a significant amount of points on projects where I copied code from my VM and pasted in my local OS (macOS) which did not encode properly and made auto-grader fail. Just make sure you cross your t's and dot your i's when submitting. \n\nThe multi-select questions on the tests were extremely tough as many of the possible answers seemed applicable. The projects were easy for the most part but Project 2 was pretty difficult. Some of the TAs were helpful while some were not. I feel like I definitely learned Took Computer Networks as my first course in OMSCS and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the content and the general interaction between students and faculty (professor and TAs). As other reviewers have mentioned, the course requires Python programming knowledge; especially the second, third, and last two projects.\nThe three tests were all administered through Proctortrack and were very manageable if you studied the lectures and the required readings.\nThe head-TA (Stacia) was very responsive and definitely deserves recognition for how well she ran the course. The other TAs were quick to respond and grade the assignments/tests.\nOverall, CS6250 is a very good introductory course to advanced Computer Networks and to how OMSCS works. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject. This was a good class. I loved the material. I started off on a bad foot because I didn't know about the Piazza forum until the first project. Though it was possible to catch up and learn quite a bit.  I have a strong background in networking, and I really enjoyed this class. The best class I've taken so far.  Like most of the comments here it's incredibly easy. Most of the assignments I believe can be completed with almost no networking knowledge. This was the first class I took in OMSCS and it left me pretty disappointed.  I really loved the lectures, but some of the projects were just head-scratchingly easy. Not a lot of rigor, although I expect them to change that in the future.  Most difficult part of the course was setting up the VM. Lectures are very interesting.  Definitely a bit harder than the score here would make you believe. The first few projects were challenging but very worth it. If you aren't very good in Python, you may struggle. The tests were also a bit tricky, so study up a lot. I would say the worst part of the course (by far) were the academic papers. They were dry, dense, and just flat out boring. The tests are a bit harder than I expected, but it's more than compensated for by extra credit opportunities. Fun to learn about how networks and the internet work! This course is a disgrace to the entire program. The lectures content is good but it is evident that not much effort has been put into them. Udacity quizes are trivial and do not facilitate or even test understanding. The HW Quiz questions mostly come out of wikipedia. As if Wikipedia is the fountain of knowledge!! I have to agree with most of the comments on this page. The lectures for this class were extremely unpolished and disorganized. The homework quizzes usually had nothing to do with the lectures and required googling but were overall not too difficult. The programming assignments were downright awful. I did not learn anything from them and spent too much time trying to figure out the ins and outs of the packages we were supposed to be using. The programming assignments usually amounted to 2-10 lines of code but always was a challenge due to subtleties in syntax. If you're looking to get an A with very little effort, this is it. I for one feel like this was a waste of time, and would probably steer clear of it if you actually want to learn about computer networks.  You can do the minimum and get a good grade in this class... Or you can do the work and learn more about computer networking than you will in any other computer class. The choice is really up to you. The amount of material you cover in this class is immense, though you aren't held accountable for all of it. What you get out of this class depends on what you put into it, and this means reading the referenced papers, watching the videos, and reviewing all of the mininet programming (not just what you're assigned to work on).  Agreed mostly with the reviews above. However, I think a big part of the problem was that there were 500 people in this class. This made Piazza a terrible tool for communication. You had to watch Piazza pretty closely to keep tabs on the various quiz questions for that week. Also, while the quizzes *were* poorly worded and vague (which is unacceptable for any CS class), some students were quite rude to the TAs, who were trying to handle 500 students. I'd echo the sentiments above about the autograder too. GT should provide some automated grading framework like web-cat to handle that load instead of TAs writing custom, fragile auto graders. This way students could validate their code before submitting. I found the lectures very informative, the quizzes at their best made you go learn new things and at their worst confused the heck out of you with vague and imprecise language. I came into the class with zero networking knowledge or Python knowledge and I came out with an A. Don't take it expecting to learn Python. The most complex code you'll write is a loop. I do feel like the lectures were very beneficial though and enjoyed watching them. If they offer this class in the same format again (which I doubt they will), be sure to check Piazza often as there are some pretty funny exchanges between rude students who take themselves a bit too seriously and TAs that are stretched a bit too thin.  I'll preface by saying, I got a top grade in this class (like many others I'd assume). The class is not technically difficult, you can get through most of the programming assingments in a few hours but do not expect it to be easy, it requires work. There are 2 assignments that took > 10 hrs to complete. They were difficult because we had to use POX and Pyretic which had very little documentation. They give you an expected solution to match and most of the time, you should be able to reach it. There are quizzes and they do take time to get right. They are not trivial, it requires reading, looking up stuff online and researching to get correctly. Course lectures ARE NOT ENOUGH. While the class is not mathematically intense or technically complex, you get a solid understanding of the concepts and material. Piazza was communication was a disaster, and assignments were changed often. Other than that, you do learn quite a bit about computer networks, structure of the internet and software defined networking.  This course is a disappointment. The instructors are trying to make it artificially hard because the reviews from previous semesters were saying that the course is easy. The result is vaguely worded tests, disappointing grades that are curved down, and core material that is still easy. \n\nThe lectures are good because they cover an interesting range of topics (a broader range than other networking classes I've seen). But they lack a bit in depth and need to be augmented. The current instructors are not the developers of the course and in some instances have a different approach. However they claim that they cannot change a single video segment or annotate it because \"it is easier to redevelop the entire course than it is to change one bit of it. \" I find this claim ridiculous at best. \n\nThe projects are very interesting but a bit easy. Those can definitely be made more challenging. \n\nThe quizes are a mess. They're vaguely worded and depend on the instructor's interpretation. They tend to be open ended, but you're expected to answer with a multiple choice or be constrained to 200 words. And in most cases, you're penalized because either you missed a nuance that's only clear in the instructor's mind, or because you didn't elaborate (although you're constrained to 200 words). My grades were like a crap shoot, totally random per quiz, for an equal amount of preparation for each quiz and understanding of the material. \n\nThe office hours were like a morning radio show with banter and little substance. I can tell that the instructors were trying hard to curve down the grades. Initially they claimed that an A will only be 92 and above (they reduced it later to a 90). They finally settled on the vaguely worded tests to make the course appear to be hard even though that's the wrong way to do it.  Mid semester review:\n\nThis class isn't necessarily 'hard', but they have made an attempt to make it more challenging. There were some new projects that had a couple of growing pains, but they worked with the class on them. Exam wise, they grade fairly. The \"multiple correct answer\" multiple choice questions can be painful due to how each answer is weighted though. \n\nThe breakdown for Fall 2016 (with Konte) is the following:\n\n8 Projects - 60%\n3 Tests - 40%\n\nThankfully we haven't had to do the quizzes that people have complained about previously. \n\nEnd of Semester Review:\n\nTBD I have heard the course changed since I took it, but the lectures were fairly straightforward; the homework assignments, as long as you set aside at least 6 hours for them, were very do-able. There were also multiple choice questions each week - these were a bit tricky, but mostly because the questions were not clear; that said, you will probably be able to answer them (I heard these got a bit easier since I took the class). I'd pair this with a harder course, or save it for over the summer.  Second class of my OMSCS career, and it was a wonderful class. TAs and Professor were very responsive. Material is great and so were the projects. No background knowledge of networking is needed. Make sure to give yourself enough time to watch the lectures and read the articles. You might need to re-watch or re-read in order to really get an understanding. I would take a tutorial on python just to freshen up on the language. Overall a great class would recommend taking. Great course to learn the fundamentals of networking. I took it cold (no introductory classes or networking experience) and had no problem. ez pz Expect to spend about 6-10 hours a week reading the papers and watching the lectures. More time will be required if you are rusty on your networking skills, as you'll need to read the textbook to catch up on basic concepts. On top of that there is a project every other week, which usually doesn't require much programming, and took me 3-5 hours on average. There are also 3 closed book tests which take a few hours to study for - easier if you have taken good notes. \n\nThis is a very good course to take. It should be called \"Advanced Computer Networking\", because like AOS, it covers modern research topics in computer networking. It is generally assumed you have a working knowledge of computer networks, and there will be little hand holding here. I learned a lot, even having professional experience. I highly recommend this course as a very practical course to take that will benefit any software engineer in their career. \n\nThe professor, M. Konte, is a internet security researcher, and the weekly office hours are a chance to pick her brain on stuff. She wasn't involved as much as I'd have liked on Piazza, though. The TAs though were very responsive on Piazza and slack - expect very quick turnarounds (< 12h) on questions asked. Tests and projects were generally graded within a couple weeks. So it's a very well run course overall. \n\nThe only negative is that a few of the projects had issues. This wasted me a lot of time on one project in particular, which was pretty annoying. I also would have liked to do more of the coding on the projects. Except for a couple exceptions, I feel like they hand-held a bit too much (mostly already implemented, you just run them and analyze the results). Lectures are interesting, but the assignments not so much. If you have elementary Python skills this class will be a breeze, otherwise learn yourself a bit of Python. The Python implementations might involve writing approximately 10 lines of code an assignment. The quizzes can get a little tricky. Its best to reason through the quizzes using question/evidence/conclusion framework This class was interesting and useful. It was very hands-on with 8 projects making up a majority of the grade in the class. Some of the projects were hard until I had a \"gotcha\" moment. I would also recommend brushing up on some of the networking fundamentals, but that's not strictly necessary. I was really excited about the course when I started, but I became uneasy and anxious after few weeks. The course required Python programming experience, there were multiple projects and 2 online proctored exams. I \"hated\" the proctored exams.... as these exams made me feel like I am in high school. During the proctored exam, we were not supposed to look away from screen, we can't move, can't think... just stare at the screen. The projects were not interesting. There was no team work either, which I believe is really important for such classes as we learn from each other. Professors and TA's were great, but I believe that there is a lot of room for improvement in the course content, assignments, projects and the structure of the entire class.  concepts were great. the homework didn't really help learn it though Programming Assignments are difficult for those who do not know Python. I would recommend you to program and understand Python fully before starting this course. This course uses framework called Pyretic; it is not a easy framework to pick up and TAs do horrible job helping you out on it. As for the quizzes, you DO need to watch the lectures or read the PDF format of the lectures to not get confused or get tricked; however, you are given 10 tries to do the quizzes. Quizzes are always at a difficult level because questions are subjective. Not an easy course anymore.  Vague, vague, vague. Quizzes were a mess and much more difficult than the lectures and assignments indicated--multiple attempts or not. By the instructors own admission, some questions were subjective and open to interpretation. The assignments were also vaguely worded and if it weren't for the superior participation of some key students on Piazza, I would not have done as well on them as I did. I would not recommend this as a first course--if it were my first OMSCS course, I would have written this program off as sub-par. The sad part is the actual work isn't that hard--it is how questions are asked and assignments worded that makes it hard. Know Python 2 going in--not even an option learning it as you go. Expect to spend most of your time 'decrypting' the teaching staffs intent. TAs, other than the lead TA, were mostly absent from Piazza--and on the weekends before assignments were due, instructors were for the most part MIA.  Quizzes were challenging -- I never got them all right on the first try, but with the multiple attempts allowed and a reasonable testing strategy, I was able to get them all correct. Note that I didn't necessarily agree with every answer that was 'correct', but I figured out what they were looking for. The projects were fairly basic and were not challenging from a programming point of view (I had relatively minimal experience with Python before the course, but pick up scripting languages pretty easily). The hard part with the programming assignments was that they were auto-graded with minimal viewing of the code so a simple mistake could cause significant issues on the grade. In some of the later assignments, classmates built some test suites that made validation much easier.  WARN: They adjust content of the course. as of Spring 2017, it have 8 projects and 3 tests. 2 or 3 of them are easy. others all take some effort. This is not a hard course, but not as easy as indicated on the review. I know some students enroll this class think it is easy, but get a C instead. This is a good course for new students so you can get familiar with OMSCS structure, Proctortrack Exam, T-Square, and Piazza.\nThe material of this course is very boring and most of the stuff are theories or concepts. The research papers are also very dry. There are 8 projects and 3 exams. You do all the projects and you are guaranteed A with minimum effort putting in studying for exams. Python programming is very limited. Most are the projects are less than 20 lines of codes, or just changing some variables/configuration in the given codes. \nTA in this course is nothing but great. Projects are returned in timely manners. Head TA is very active on Piazza and there is weekly office hour in helping students on projects.  \nProject 2 and 3 can be tricky, but after that, the course has a very light workload. Piazza is a mess with some students abusing it with silly basic questions. People basically don't read and ask all kinds of questions that are clearly explained in the project requirement.\n Context:\n- 4th course of the program. \n- Software engineer with many years of experience. \n- Limited networking experience (socket programming, HTTP, some tools like ping, dig). \n- Comfortable with Python. \n\nPros:\n- Broad range of topics: Design of the Internet, Router Internals, Congestion Protocols, Traffic shaping, SDN and more. \n- I learned a lot, and feel better equipped to go on my own and read further materials. \n- The projects were fun and interesting, a mix of programming, understanding the papers, analyzing results, etc. \n- Some of the TA's were supportive, available and responsive. \n- Most of the papers were interesting and expanded the material of the lectures. \n- Projects and environment were well prepared and presented. \n- Grades were returned in reasonable time. \n\nCons:\n- Some of the TA's were not available. \n- Professor was not available. \n- Multiple choice questions in the tests were a little bit tricky. \n- Second test covered lots of material and heavy on the grade 30%. \n\nOverall:\n- Good course, reasonable amount of work, fun projects, lots of material\n- Be ready to read a lot of papers, the tests cover them. \n- Some projects have subtle aspects, don't underestimate them, start early. This course is great if you are new to networking. Best part of the course is the interesting content, particularly the reading, which provides some good details in understanding networking. I also really appreciate the head TA, Stacia, who is very dedicated to keep the course running smoothly. Projects and exams are fairly easy as long as you invest time in going through lectures and papers. Grading is very generous. Overall, projects are interesting, but should be improved in depth. Fairly straightforward course but low quality. Crazy amounts of TAs supporting this course, so the Piazza forum was especially supportive. The quizzes rely way too much on wording to \"test\" knowledge; every quiz had a deluge of students complaining about interpretations of the questions due to language used. If you want an A in this course, then you need to figure out a way to read the professor's mind in order to answer the questions. Assignments were interesting but too easy; I was able to complete each assignment within a 6 hour window the weekend it was due. The professor spoke poorly of many of his colleagues throughout semesters' office hours, which I did not view as professional.  This is an easy course even though the projects have been updated. The projects uses python and implements some typical algorithms in computer networking. Some projects are more survey-like, basically running some commands and writing reports. You need to study the lectures and read papers as well. If you have programming experience, you should be fine to complete the projects. I find it interesting that some people claim they have no experience in python and find coding projects very hard. They probably have no programming experience as well but it does not change the fact that many projects are really not about the programming itself, all programming language uses in the course projects are basic. It is more about the course contexts rather than some language gimmicks. What I really like as well as other courses is that by studying the tests, I am forced to learn the concepts in depth, not just recognize the terms. You have to write essay answers in tests. Overall, it is a good course that covers most concepts of computer networking, especially in TCP/IP, network security. Personal Background: One of two classes taken in my first semester. First programming since completing my undergraduate computer engineering degree in December 2014. Worked in power distribution since then. Never programmed in Python before.\n\n\nCourse Experience: I rated this course a \"Loved!\" as an incredibly helpful introduction to computer networks. You will use the basics of python for the assignments that are not exceedingly difficult. I simply had to transfer basic coding techniques from C and Java into Python syntax. This class introduces a broad and limited understanding of computer networks topics. This is not a course that will teach you about writing code for significant network applications with SDNs or otherwise. The instructor was largely absent which made for some easy extra credit discussions. The TAs were very helpful and effective and made the course successful. Only one assignment out of eight had a significant issue that didn't effect grades for anyone. Exams were simple memorization of concepts from the lectures and papers. I earned an A in this course even without the extra credit so I'm confident the vast majority of students would be able to given enough time to figure out the harder projects. Great first course or easier course to pair with a harder one.  Scientific research papers are a bit long and numerous(not sure there is a cost-benefit there... maybe considering requiring PARTS not ALL for each paper). The videos are pretty straight forward, and you have to know videos and papers for the TESTS. We only had 2 tests, but were supposed to have many----next semester I think they will do more. The projects were cool and interesting(know your Python), once you figured out how to get started. That might be my one recommendation is that sometimes we really had no idea how to get started. They definitely expect the \"figuring it out\" part is the first step of each project and is crucial to understanding. The autograders were a bit scary, cause even when you got the project working, you were worried whether your project would pass or not. Our last project has an autograder we had access to, so we knew for sure. Hopefully that will become the norm. My advice, the projects are very doable if you start early. Those who waited really seemed to panic at the end. TA (esp Michael) were extremely communicative in Piazza, so use that site daily for questions and updated. The course looks like they are redesigning, so there is definitely some re-ordering that needs to be done between readings, quizzes, and projects. But, overall good course with appropriate level of time commitment.  I took this as my first class in the OMSCS program. I have significant embedded programming experience in C but I had only very basic previous experience with Python, the language required for all of the assignments. That said, I found the project objectives clearly explained and with the help of a few good python books enjoyed the projects and was able to do very well on them. For the spring 16 semester this class had 2 proctored tests. I would have preferred if the test material had been spread across perhaps 4 tests. It was challenging to both prepare for and thoroughly cover the required material in just the 2 tests.  If you have programming experience in Python, it is pretty easy. They added quizzes to the homeworks and some had vague questions that were debated a great deal on Piazza. Wish I would have taken it with another class because it was very little effort overall.  The lectures teach a lot. The homeworks you can do without learning much, which is sad because they introduce you to some interesting tools.  I like the lectures. The actual coding part is easy. The quizzes are easy. What is not easy, and extremely frustrating, is using Mininet and all the associated tools. It is hard to debug. Often, you don't even know what error you made. The environment itself is hard to work with because you can follow the directions and still something may not work right.  Lecture videos are appropriate, but assignments are only very loosely related, and are very easy. Assignments not well organized and buggy. Only real prerequisite is a willingness to debug Python and Linux VMs. You can skip lecture videos, but I highly reccomend not doing so. The assignments themselves don't give you much benefit without them.  This class doesn't have a huge amount of content, is farily straight forward and is possibly the easiest class offered. The content of the course is offered in a very presentable way with some good opportunities to learn outside of the class. Some of the assignments are more time consuming than others, but this course shouldn't take too much time each week. I recommend it if you want some good content, but not a lot of it.  Not a very good class. The videos are interesting enough, but the assignments don't really teach networking. You spend more time figuring out badly documented Python API calls than you do on anything like networking concepts. I learned stuff from the videos, but the assignments were an exercise in frustration (and I'm a professional with Python experience and got a 9/10 or 10/10 on every assignment so far). Luckily, the Piazza boards were relatively helpful; just don't start the assignment in the first few days and let others beat their heads against the wall, and then use what they said to finish the assignment. Be sure to give back after you're done, though.  Interesting material. No exams. Just open-book quizzes and programming assignments. \n\nProgramming assignments require use of a VM and knowledge of Python, but they are mostly simple and take up no more than a day or two. \n\nNice to take along with other \"tough\" courses. For those who use these reviews to pick an \"easy\" course, please note that this course changes significantly from semester to semester, using student feedback, so only use recent reviews. \n\nIn the Fall 2016, we had 8 projects and 3 proctored exams. There was something due nearly every week, with projects of varying difficulty and with tests definitely requiring a good amount of time to study, as they included a lot of \"short essay\" questions, were timed, and proctored (via ProctorTrack). \n\nI found this class very enjoyable because it didn't include a lot of \"busy work\" - most everything we were asked to do led to learning something valuable. The projects were the best part. The tests were fair in that if you read all the material and did all the projects, you were pretty well prepared, but if you didn't understand something, it would become apparent on the short essay questions, of which there were many. \n\nI'd say the class is \"easy\" in that it does not require too much prior CS knowledge to succeed. You need to know a little bit of Python for most projects (but way less than KBAI or Computer Photography, for example), and you need to stay on top of things because there is a lot of material. But it is all doable and largely enjoyable. Definitely recommend. Good way to get an introduction to how OMSCS courses are run without a lot of pressure.  TAs are pretty good, instructor participation is okay, topics are covered at a high level, and the coding projects are relatively easy.\n\nThis course felt easier than it needed to be.  Like they stretched the material to fill the course instead of going deeper into the topics. Overall, a solid course. I liked a lot of the projects earlier in the course, although they were a little bit more difficult. Expect to spend a lot of time on the earlier projects, and get bored with the middle of the course projects, and then pick back up again a bit for the end of the semester. \n\nExcept for the beginning of the course, the projects weren't too difficult or too time consuming, though there are quite a few projects. There were quite a few problems with the Course VM. \n\nTA's were good, but Piazza was a mess. Tons of duplicate posts and people asking ELI5 questions, even though this is a grad course. Sometimes the TAs could be dismissive of issues telling you that it was all in the instructions somewhere, so make sure to read CAREFULLY!\n\nTests weren't too hard, multiple choice or select all that apply, and based mostly on the concepts. Make sure to do to the readings though, as they are also covered in the tests. Overall I found this was a good class, but since it was my first OMSCS I have no other class to compare it. Here are my thoughts on the class:\nPRO:\n- Projects were very interesting and relevant. \n- Homeworks were good and the professor provided good answers\n- Office Hours were good and often provided hints and good discussion on homeworks and tests\n- Tests were tricky and required a lot of time to complete\n- The class had an active Piazza and students were very willing to help with questions\nCON:\n- While the video lectures were good, they did not provide the depth required for this class\n- Tests: Since there were only 10 questions on each test, each wrong answer could have a negative effect on your overall grade. Bomb a test, and it could drop you a letter grade. \n- Projects: Not much assistance was offered, and if you got stuck on a coding issue, not much help was available (except from Piazza, see above)\nTIPS for the CLASS:\nIf you are thinking about taking this class, here are some useful tips:\n- PYTHON - make sure you have good Python programming skills. If not, you will struggle with the projects. The class assumes you can write Python programs. \n- If you didn't take an undergraduate Networking class, consider getting the suggested textbook: Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach. This was helpful\n- Attend (or watch afterwards) all the Office Hours - very helpful and critical to my passing the class (professor gives good hints on the tough test questions)\n- Read all the posts on Piazza. Again this provided hints and details on tough test questions. \n- And don't forget to have fun! A new instructor has taken on this course and it should now be known as \"Python programming with Computer Networking concepts\". The second project required some students to spend 40-80 hours (over a two week period) even with knowledge of Python. The recorded lectures are very dry and not comprehensive. The TAs were a bit behind the times at first but have improved as the semester progressed. Took as my first course and would not recommend as such. The course is not simple, but the content is concrete and straight-forward, especially if you have any experience in network implementation and support. It's an appropriate foundational class, anyone who aspires to a Masters in CS should understand and be conversant in these concepts. \n\nNo real python expertise is needed for the projects, they are really focused on the networking concepts. Given their weight (60% this semester) they could have been more challenging. \n\nFor this semester the papers were the meat of the course - one a week on average, plus plenty of supplemental reading and online videos if you want to spend the time digging in. \n\nTwo closed-book tests - both were fair assessments of your grasp of the material. \n\nProfessor & lead TA were very engaged, and the Piazza community was active and for the most part helpful.  Good first class to get your feet wet for the OMSCS program especially if you don't have that strong of a CS background. TA's were helpful. Could get by without listening to the lectures or readings and just focusing on the assignments. Not the most interesting class but useful.  If you need an easy class to fulfill a requirement, then this one can meet that need in a pinch. I was disappointed however because I am interested in the subject, and I feel that this class really only gave a whirlwind thin covering of the material. While I did learn more than I knew starting the class, I wanted more out of it. The assignments were a bizarre combination of ridiculously easy connect the dots exercises with explicit step by step instructions paired with buggy software and buggy instructions. I prefer it when the challenges in an assignment are inherit in the material rather than due to mistakes by the course developers. Finally, unlike with my other courses, I felt like the professor and TAs were dialing this course in and not really excited to be teaching it as part an online program.  I had an extremely difficult time in this course. The lectures were actually pretty good throughout the first half of the course but became more technical and less well explained during the second. The projects were not difficult, but I don't feel that they added anything to my understanding of the concepts. \n\nThe major problem I had with this course was the quizzes. The multiple choice questions were loaded with ambiguous answers, which still seemed ambiguous after watching the lectures multiple times and scouring Google for information. It often felt like you were left with 2 or 3 equally plausible choices and then forced to make a guess. There were multiple times where I felt like I actually, thoroughly understood what the question was asking and how each of the answers worked, but still had to just guess which was the \"best\" answer. \n\nThe free response questions weren't as tricky, but only gave you 90-120 words to explain your solution. There were 2 times in the beginning where I was penalized for not including all the information - I knew the information that I had left out, I tried to imply it in the response as much as possible, but didn't know how to get it all in there given the short answer length. I felt like I was being penalized not because of my understanding, but because of some weird artificial limitation. After this, rather than trying to explain my solution, I wrote down shorter jargon filled answers that, truthfully, I sometimes didn't fully understand and ended up getting full credit. This to me seems like a flaw - it felt to me that the grade was less about understanding and more about memorization. \n\nThis may be a harsh review, but I really didn't like this class.  This was a great class. The projects are challenging enough to be interesting, but not overwhelming. There's no busywork; all the homework is relevant. I learned a lot, and I really enjoyed the experience. The projects were very interesting and overall not to difficult to complete. All of the projects are in Python. The Lectures weren't bad and also didn't take very long to complete. There's quite a number of papers to read every week though and that can suck up a good chunk of time. There were two tests for the summer semester and they weren't awful as long as you were very thorough in your studying. For Summer we had 5 Projects though there was talk about examining the amount of projects to offer in Fall/Spring semesters so be ready for some minor restructuring. I don't think the instructor posted once all semester. The video lectures are very good, though I found it flowed better on a higher speed. The quiz questions are often badly worded, and need clarification from the TAs on piazza. Also, I haven't seen a post from Nick since the first week of class... err, the second week because they started late. Basically, it's not too difficult a class if you can get a consensus on what the questions mean, are familiar with basic linux, VMs, basic python, some general networking concepts and aren't disturbed by a what feels like a beta version of the class.  The course is one of the very well organised ones here in OMSCS. The course did change in its organisation this semester significantly but the contents did not change at all. The course is made a bit more tougher than what it was previously. So instead of some easy projects and easier questions in exams the course now has a few tough projects though only 2 can be called as tough. And the questions in Test1 and Test2 are arguably tougher, but Test3 still had easier questions to answer. It is still not a hard course if you want to get a B but is definitely a hard course to get a A I really enjoyed the course. It's well structured and the assignments are evenly partitioned, which helps time management. The subject is interesting and we covered a lot of computer networks material, from low-level routing and switching up to detecting rogue AS's. People who didn't know Python had a tougher time, so knowing it really helps. There were a number of papers to read (I liked them, some didn't). The instructor, Maria Konte, was new and stayed in the background until near the end, but TA team was great and the head TA Michael was a superstar so the class moved along like clockwork, with assignments coming back regularly and useful feedback. Some projects were a bit raw out of the gate - fortunately, the students on Piazza were very helpful in finding and fixing issues to keep things moving. Don't be fooled by the early reviews - it's not an easy class, it has morphed to be about medium difficulty and time - but it is predictable and well-tuned. This class introduces some great concepts but fails to get into depth of anything. Great class If you are looking for getting credits.  Good course. Learned a lot. Projects were split between writing code, and reading papers and running through experiments. The biggest headache for these was getting mini net to work properly and consistently. Tests weren't easy, but were fair. If you spend the week or so before hand studying and read all the papers you should do fine. TAs were really good, and the office hours were actually worth attending. \n\nI took this course alongside another class, so I may be off the mark, but this class was much more time consuming than it appears to be rated. Maybe they changed the content, or maybe I spent more time than normal, but I would have a hard time believing that 6 hours a week was enough for this course, since the lectures alone were at least an hour or two, and the papers were multiple pages, and released every week. \n\nYou need to know Python, but with the time frames you are given for projects (2 weeks), its a lot easier to learn in a course like this over say a course like Computational Photography Great instructor and TAs. Piazza was pretty active, and the teaching staff was quick to respond to most questions. This semester, we had 2 tests @ 20% each, and 6 projects at 10% each. The projects were all pretty simple, with Python as the required language. Having basic Python knowledge is recommended. Also, the staff released problem sets before the tests that prepared you pretty well for the material. To keep on schedule, we typically had to read one paper a week and watch one 30-minute lecture.  This class is not difficult. When you try to pose easy material as difficult it ends up creating confusions. This is what has happened to this course. Instructors are trying to make it difficult by adding complexity at wrong place. I think this course should be scrapped and redone. I spend more time understanding questions and wordings to make sense of it rather than solving question. Projects are not difficult but you spend more time understanding them than actual implementation.  This was a tough first class.  Wound up with a B, but worked my butt off for it.  If you aren't coming in with a CS background, you are forced to dive in quickly.  The class felt very disorganized and the teacher only showed up twice during the semester, so you're taught exclusively by TA's.  \n\nThe content was super interesting, but not recommended as the first class to take in the program.   During the semester I took the course, NW's was quite easy from an assignment perspective. The course has been revamped since. Despite this, the lectures were well organized and went well above and beyond my undergraduate course content on the same subject. Great course. Having had no context on networks prior to this class, I feel like I now have sufficient knowledge of the basics and enough context to learn networking concepts on my own if I have to. \n\nIt was my first semester, and I took this class along with another course (IOS) in anticipation that CN would be pretty light, given the reviews. It was more substantial than I expected and I would put it at a \"medium\" in terms of difficulty, now that I've finished. \n\nOverall, the assignments were great for understanding the concepts we covered in class, although I felt that some were not substantial or applicable enough. For example, there was one assignment, which was one of the more difficult assignments, that more so had to do with data structures rather than networking concepts themselves. \n\nExams were thorough and I felt that they sufficiently tested my knowledge, and the instructor and TA's were very responsive. Not sure if this will be the same for subsequent semesters, but I also appreciated the quick grading! Lastly, a working knowledge of Python will be useful for completing assignments. This class is very poorly designed and run. The course material is on par with an undergrad networking class minus any exams. I'd say this class should be an easy A, but it's very easy to lose points on the assignments due to the vague broken english the questions are written in, and the autograder which will deduct points for ridiculous things such as having extra whitespace in your text file. Also don't try to bring any of this up on the piazza forum because the TAs will get offended and hint that your grade may suffer for being a troublemaker.  The class was fun and built upon basic networking concepts. \nTowards the latter half of the semester, the world load was very light depending on how you managed your time. If you got the projects done during the first week, the second week was mostly just lectures/reading. \n\nThere is a ton of reading in this class. It can get a bit dry and daunting, especially since each week there are a handful of papers to read, each being ~13-15 pages in length. On top of that, some projects have a surprise paper that must be read to complete it. On top of this, even though some papers are split into the second week of the project, they are helpful to read if completing the project during the first week. This also applies to the video lectures. \n\nFor the summer semester, there were 5 projects and 2 tests. Project 1-3 were pretty simple, Project 2 taking the most time. Projects 4-5 were a bit more open ended and validating your work could sometimes be difficult. \n\nBecause it was the summer, they squished the latter half of the content into a single exam worth 30% of your grade. In my opinion, this was too heavily weighted, with each incorrect answer reducing your final grade by over 1% (as there were only 26 questions on this exam. )\n\nThe TAs were responsive and helpful, but the instructor was completely absent. She appeared once to ask \"why we were interested in the course. \" She was supposed to post weekly discussion threads to provoke thoughtful discussion, but this never happened. These discussion threads were to apply to a 5% extra credit score, which ended up being applied to everyone's grade since no threads were ever posted. \n\nOverall, I liked the class and I learned a lot, but it has flaws which I hope are resolved in the coming semesters. 2nd project was pretty difficult, and didn't feel rewarding. Material was not too hard to grok, and I had literally no networking experience whatsoever. That said, not sure if I would recommend the course. I took this class my first semester in the program, alongside operating systems. I didn't technically meet the prerequisites, never having had a networking class in my undergrad curriculum, but I wanted to use my first semester to maybe try to get some of the more fundamental topics squared away. \n\nI learned a fair bit about how the internet worked, and the introduction to software defined networking was fun to play around in. But I could feel that the class was kind of in an awkward state right now, perhaps transitioning somewhat from a heaver focus on SDN when the course was first designed. Lectures referred to projects that were no longer part of the course, for example, and I'd say only the last two of the eight projects really involved playing around with SDN. \n\nThe remainder of the projects concerned fundamentals (e. g. graph search over a topology) or were follow-along demonstrations of topics we read about in journal articles. These latter projects really required no coding -- you'd just follow the instructions provided and write up the results. \n\nSome of the projects were newly designed and had bugs, but those were worked out and time extensions were given where necessary. If they keep the same project structure I don't expect that to be a problem in later semesters. \n\nA couple other reviews say the tests were hard. I didn't think so, really? I got As on the first two but a C on the final, so maybe they were adjusting the difficulty as they went along. Then again I didn't really study very hard for the final since I was focused on my other course... \n\nMy \"5 hours\" is a guess; I didn't keep track. Some weeks I barely did anything, but where there was a test or a particularly challenging project that might creep closer to 10 or 15. Rarely, though. This course was requires a lot of work, there is almost a weekly assignment with lectures and reading. The two exams are tricker. What salvages this course is it offered some additional credit in Spring 2017", 
    "CS-6262": " Some unorganized bullet points:\n- I think the class is very chaotic and is not ready at this time but has huge potential. \n- Most assignments are superficial and I don't think that I learned a lot. I took it because they mentioned Bitcoins and Machne Learning security in course description but bitcoins were just incidentally mentioned and Machine Learning part was just to update basic python script. \n- I spent 30 hours on one assignment and like 80% of this time was chasing the Instructor to clarify what they meant and fixing environment because it simply doesn't work. Provided assignment instructions were not really helpful. In our internet traffic assignment, they provided instructions to use deprecated API that simply never worked so I don't know if they actually tried to implement it themselves. Students had to figure out on our own how to set up everything and solve the problem the other way. \n- Instructors provided little to no guidance but most TAs were very helpful. \n\nDespite getting an A, this was really unpleasant and stressful experience. I would not recommend this class at this time. TLDR: Expect to teach yourself the material and comb through Piazza\\Slack looking for answers to questions; but was generally an interesting class. Assignments not hard just confusing. \n\nPrep: Have good familiarity with different variants of linux, and be familiar enough to have to deal with VMs without UIs. Having a basic understanding of python, network\\programming basics, and android development. \n\nMy expectations for the class were to lean about network security and ways to prevent attacks or make it harder for attacks to happen. After the course I would say some of these expectations were met. \n\nThe course feels like a great overview of some of the security vulnerabilities in the existing structure of networks and the internet. It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them. \n\nThe course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted. \n\nOverall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors. \n\nThe Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class. He did not even post a single comment and was not involved in the class at all. \n\nThe TAs lead this class completely, with one TA standing way above all the rest. And he wasn\u2019t even the head TA. Overall, good content, badly run course. Required regrades on 3/5 projects due to autograder being subpar. Professor does not exist. TAs were alright but had to change projects halfway through due to their own mistakes. \n\nOverall needs to be run cleaner and not so harsh. People are here to learn, if you want to make a class tougher, make it so that you are just as passionate as we need to be. Can't check out and then be rude all day.\n\nSome of the students in this class asked terrible questions, it seems to attract students who don't belong in the program. Although the course was quite easy, I liked it a lot. All the projects were very interesting, well put together. I loved the fact that the exam was optional and the focus was more on practice. My advice to the course creators: do not make those optional projects optional. I am sure, GT students would be able to handle all 6 of them during the single semester. Also, the experience of breaking into metasploitable is definitely a great takeaway! This course has great potential, but awful execution. The material isn't difficult, but the course itself was an exercise in frustration. The only reasons I'm giving two stars are because the material is interesting and because one of the TAs actually did make an effort to engage with the students. If you are looking for a class where you can have meaningful discussions and really dig into the material, definitely pass on this course for now. \n\nProfessor Lee never communicated with students a single time. When a project was shut down when students got emails from GA Tech Cyber Security telling them they were violating institute policy and potentially federal law, there was silence. When the final project was based around a paper he authored and questions were posted regarding both practical and theoretical application of the concepts, there was silence. The instructor could have been listed as \"Mickey Mouse\" and the student experience would have been the same. \n\nOther instructors were not much help either. If you have a question about something in a project writeup, be prepared to be told to re-read the writeup ad nauseum or to literally beg for clarification on Piazza and then get ignored. Expect cryptic or poorly-worded responses from instructors buried in random threads with no further clarifications provided, and private posts to go unresolved for entire project windows. One TA did hold weekly office hours and actively participated in Slack and Piazza, but it just wasn't enough. \n\nStudents were also limited in their ability to help each other, despite the lack of instructor participation. Trying to give hints or troubleshoot led to one occasion of instructors threatening students with honor code violations. Solutions to past projects were also deemed off-limits due to the fear of withdrawn students hiding on Piazza to learn the solutions. If you didn't figure it out yourself, too bad. \n\nStill on track for an A, though the 10% extra credit exam is no longer EC. This is definitely not an easy class, and takes more than 4-5 hours/week of effort. The projects were interesting; some of them were challenging, and some were straightforward. A few of the projects could be huge time sinks, and could easily take 40 hours. The lectures were excellent, but to truly appreciate them, you need to at least skim the suggested readings. I personally loved reading the papers; they're entertaining, like war stories between the good people and the malicious hackers. The quizzes and the optional final exam were straightforward. I had no problems with the grading, and thought the TAs were patient, helpful, and fair. \n\nHowever, some of the students in the class were some of the most entitled I have found in the program. These students complained and demanded a lot. There were numerous requests for due date extensions with the given excuse of having full time jobs and families.... The problem is that probably 90% of us were in the same situation, and yet we still got the projects done on time. A few students missed the final exam, and blamed the instructors for the \"non-standard\" exam window. Are we in a graduate school here? Piazza was extremely noisy, and a lot of students offered opinions that caused much confusion. Academic integrity violations were rampant: students shared (partial) solutions on Piazza, discussed solutions and included code in their postings, or provided hints that reveal way too much information. TAs had to delete code from some posts, but it's not clear if the students were disciplined or not. \n\nIf you take notes during lectures, do the readings, and work on the projects carefully and independently, this class takes about 15 hours/week. But, if you don't, and simply post on Piazza asking for hand holding on every single difficulty that you run into, or wait until last minute and simply follow the \"walkthrough\" that would be inevitably built up on Piazza, then yes, this would be an easy class that would take 4-5 hours/week. To preface, I work in netsec. This course is a poor netsec course that feels like an afterthought to the professor/course designer. This may be one of the better \"easy\" electives to take in the OMSCS program, but it's definitely not one of the best courses in the program. \n\nThe lectures are shallow, fast paced, incomplete, and often a waste of time. The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is. \n\nThe projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to \"hack together\" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations. \n\nThis class is a shotgun scattershot of topics with poor instruction. The professor isn't engaged at all. The projects aren't hard, just frustrating and annoyingly time consuming for trivial things. If you'd really like to understand netsec, take 6035 and read Hackers' Playbook, Web App Hackers' Handbook, and Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Don't pay tuition for this course. This course is pretty interesting. It's hard too. All projects are based off of research papers. So you essentially have 2 weeks to read and digest the material and finish the assignment. Lectures covered most topics tangentially - which were helpful for quizes but not for projects. On an average, I spent 12 hours or more per week on this course I wanted to take an easy course to boost my GPA. This I thought would be course and I took it in the summer. I was partially wrong! The course is not intense from a material point of you. The subject matter is relatively straight forward and dry. Get as many points as you can from the quizzes. The projects are pretty interesting but take a lot of time. They are not simple or straightforward you need to invest time indoing it! The course material is interesting but the instructor was basically nonexistent. I probably watched 30% of the lectures but read all of the course slides and that turned out to be enough. The quizzes provided in the lectures are the worst I've ever seen. Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As. The lesson here is just do the work and start early on the projects. They are not extremely difficult but they do take time so don't underestimate them. I would break my workload estimate down to ~6 hours of project work and 2 hours of viewing lectures and reading papers. I liked the class a lot, the projects were really cool, although needing some fine tuning--both in the wording and descriptions, and the resources to figure out. I found myself getting stuck for hours on stupid stuff, instead of spending my time struggling with the real content.  The auto grader was rather scary because you literally had no idea if what you submitted would work or not.  If this is going to be used, there has to be a system where we can verify our submission. The weekly quizzes were too easy compared to content and had little to do with projects.  But, if you learn by doing in projects, this is a good course.  This is my 2nd class from OMSCS. I agree with a lot of the reviews here. This course is not difficult if you have some programming experience but just very time consuming. The projects are disconnected from the lectures where the lectures cover extremely broad concept whereas the projects are nitpicking on very specific knowledge. You have to self-learn a lot of things to be able to do the projects. Also, the projects are all over the place, not building on top of previous projects' knowledge or experience. I wouldn't recommend this course unless you are REALLY interested in network security. I think this class has high ratings because it's pretty easy, but I personally don't think it was a very good class. \n\nTo be fair: it's clear that Dr. Lee is an expert in security, and the instructor and TAs all did a fine job organizing Piazza etc. And, on the plus side, the class is purely project-based, and the projects are almost entirely \"color by the numbers, \" so if you can just follow the *detailed* instructions you are given you should be able to finish each project eventually and even get an A. \n\nBe prepared, though, the projects are very concrete and steps you need to follow very clear, but that doesn't mean it's easy. Some of the projects can be huge time sucks while you basically guess and check to find an acceptable answer. \n\nOn the negative side, I found the lectures very poor, like watching a video of someone reading flash cards. They contain frequent \"quizzes\" where the quiz itself is the instructional material. These aren't recaps of anything that is covered elsewhere, it's guess-and-check until you can match a bunch of terms (which you may never have heard of) to their definition, or the exact short answer they want to a vague and open-ended question. The next segment of the video will of course, not discuss the terms you just learned, but move on to something else. It's basically like having wikipedia read to you. \n\nToo often this class felt like going on a tour of the chocolate factory, being quickly rushed from room to room and being told briefly what the machines are called, then having the warning labels read out loud to you. When it was time for a project, it was like being sat at the controls for one of the giant mixers or something, told to push the red button, and write down how much chocolate comes out. \n\nI scored over a 100 (due to extra credit), but still I wish I could have a do-over and take something else instead. The projects were intriguing and they complimented the professor's video lectures and research papers very well. As long as you read the papers and watch video lectures prior to reading and coding the assignment, you should do well. It's definitely an informative class that opens security awareness. Topics like malware detection evasion and botnet infrastructures and takedowns are very important for the security community to pick up on. I would strongly agree with one of the other comments here \"Projects didn't tie in much with the lectures and lacked a lot of clarity, but were enjoyable\". This nicely sums up my experience with this course. \nThe projects were well balanced between being exciting, very cool and the same time posed a little bit of challenge once in a while. The course work along with the projects took a good 10hrs per week which included a quiz that was posted every friday covering the lecture material for that week. \nThe weekly quiz ensured that we were also up-to-date on the lectures so if you planning to take a week off during the course, you might need to plan that a bit. Overall the exams and the quizes were easy, but. the exam being a closed book covering the entire semester, posted quite a bit of challenge getting though all the material before the exam. How are people thinking this class was easy? I didn't rate it very hard because I save that rating for 6505 exclusively, and my idea of medium was 6310. Easy for me were 6440 and 6300. It took a considerable amount of time to do this classwork each week, and I get why we are given two weeks to do the assignments. It's not easy, don't let the 2. 4 rating fool you. The topics many of us may know tangentially are covered through application in these assignments, so two weeks to learn theory and apply it at a mastery level isn't much. I don't mean the theory they're teaching, I mean the theory required to complete the assignments, which is completely different from Network Security. I think the course covers a lot of great materials and some of the projects were insightful but I was disappointed to find that the Projects at times provided no instructions, at times were graded in an arbitrary fashion by TAs and required an awful lot of time (one of the programming projects required nearly 30-40 hours a week if you have beginner or intermediate programming experience).  I have to really highlight that NO instructions were provided.  For example in one of the projects we were required to utilize a well known security tool and you were graded on your implementation of that tool, but no instructions or examples were given and that left some students wondering why they didn't just invest the money in taking a class to learn that toolset from another provider.\n\nIn my case I had to drop because of the time commitments (I work 40+ hours and run a business on the side) and because after getting As on other projects and assignments I received a terrible score on one project and could not recover.  Unfortunately, although I had put in 60 hours of work in and I could demonstrate the logic in my code was correct and met stated requirements, the TAs provided no credit on account of how they expected it to function (requirements that were unstated and undocumented).  Truthfully I received so little feedback and so few instructions that I withdrew in part because I realized I would learn more with my time and money spent elsewhere (ex: CCNA).\n\nAlmost considered dropping the program altogether (I felt the University misrepresented the coursework as something you could maintain with a full time job) but I decided to try another class and see how it goes.  I am also considering leaving work for a couple of months and may attempt the class again during that time.\n This was a course with a ton of potential, and a topic that I was interested in, but poor professor and TA instructions made it more aggravating than anything. Pretty sure the professor never actually showed up on the forums, and I really question what he actually did, though I am pretty sure the answer is nothing at all. \n\nTAs outside of 1 or 2 were pretty useless. They seemed absolutely lost when concerning projects and really all guidance on what to do / etc was handled by a few students who everyone else more or less followed. Grading was pretty poor. They would state deadlines then blow right past them. You went into the last week not knowing almost half of your grade. \n\nThe class consisted of 10 open note quizzes, that were easy if you used Google. Lectures are pretty much worthless for the quizzes. There are 5 projects, though one is split into two parts. Most of the projects themselves are easy, but I found myself spending hours, if not days trying to get their VMs to work, each of which seemed to be just thrown together at the last second. There was an extra credit exam as well, which was very helpful. Let me start with the good. I will admit that I learned a good bit in this course about a wide variety of different topics. \n\nUnfortunately, I had to teach most of this to myself. This, in my mind, made the course very stressful because the skills needed to complete the projects were not taught in the course. There was a lot of \"here's the manual, here's a paper, learn this new technology, complete the project. \" Some of the project write-ups were downright terrible and did not include nearly enough information for someone inexperienced with that particular system to complete it on their own, certainly not within the given time frame. Thank goodness for Piazza. Wouldn't have been able to finish the class without it. \n\nAnother thing which really bugged me: each project had a separate VM, and NONE of them were ready to go out of the box. Each required re-configuring, setup, or installations which were time consuming and error prone. On more than one project I spent more time setting up the environment than I did completing actual work. \n\nFinal thoughts: don't take this in the summer, and brush up on Linux, Virtual Box, port scanning, Snort, and JavaScript first. Go in with the expectation that this is a self-taught course, and expect to spend a LOT of time on Piazza. Start projects as soon as they become available and set aside plenty of time to work on them each day. The professor's lack of involvement was a bit disappointing. Projects didn't tie in much with the lectures and lacked a lot of clarity, but were enjoyable. Wish there was more information in regards to how to defend against cyberattacks. It was a great course in fact. I got exposed to several varieties of projects starting from browser security to network level, which I would not have come across in my 20 year career in IT development field. I became hands on in Python, especially in Data Structures. Course was pretty hectic with 6 projects, 10 Quizzes open book and 1 final all closed exam. TAs were very active through out the course. I meant literally they were very responsive to every question that I have posted. Coming to preparation part, I went through all the videos twice. There were many papers to read. Best part was each of those important papers were precisely explained in Udacity videos except Professor's dialect :) I listened to the videos and read the papers. Quizzes require reading. Projects were really awesome. I did all the projects very well. I was able to relate the practical aspect of the Network Security via projects. One project was really challenging one. I had to scan the whole world wide Internet using university supported infrastructure and processes. The last project was really cool. I had to read the research paper and implement the python code to evade the Intrusion detection itself. I also got good reading material for Bit coins. On down side, auto grading kept me in tension till l last minute.. Also, many fellow students were appeared to be super smart. They were also very helpful. I needed to be on Piazza & Slack up to date. At the end, I realized, Security was really mindset. Overall, TAs helped me to complete the course successfully. Now, I am looking forward to the next course. Network Security was great!! I think that of all the OMSCS classes that I have taken this one is the most important for those who work in any form of capacity with networks or web applications. It covers a good number of the bases. Plenty of decent reading for students and you are free to make it as difficult and thorough as you would like to. It could be very challenging though for those without much experience in the areas of network or web application security. This is the 3rd course I've taken (after IOS and AOS) and it was abysmal. As some other reviews have said, the professor was nowhere to be seen. The class felt like it was just run by TAs who (mostly) had no clue. The was really only one exception, which just wasn't enough to save this course. However, my complaints about this course are as follow:\n\n1. ) The lectures were mostly terrible. On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful. \n\n2. ) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles. \n\n3. ) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/\n\n4. ) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the \"www. \" on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade. TAs had to regrade nearly every project and it was like pulling teeth to get them to realize their mistakes. As well, they never released the answers, so we just have to trust them after all their fumbles. \n\n5. ) I learned nothing. I think the longest project took me 6 hours and the shortest about 2 hours and it would've been very easy to do each one without watching the lectures or reading the papers. \n\nThis class has great potential, but in its current form it's absolutely terrible. In hindsight, I wish I had taken anything else or nothing at all. Steer clear, if you can. If you can't, try to take this in the fall or spring. I feel like doing this over the summer semester made all of this class' shortcomings more obvious. I am a full time Senior Network engineer and do security work on the side so this class was right up my alley. It was one of the easiest out of the 7 classes I have taken so far. Only a few hours of work a week. \n\nLike others mentioned there are only 4 projects that make up your grade. They are not too difficult and do not take up much time. The first is doing a frame busting exploit and creating a Chrome extension/exploit with Javascript. I have never used Javascript before and found it easy to Google what I needed. Youtube videos helped with creating the Chrome extension. \n\nThe second project involved doing malware analysis using some command line tools and Wireshark while running malware in a VM. If you have not used Wireshark you can find some how to Youtube videos to show you how to find data in packets. \n\nThe third was doing some more packet analysis with Wireshark and writing firewall rules using IP Tables. This project along with the first two took less than 10 hours each. \n\nThe fourth was implementing an exploit in an IDS by modifying some Python code. This one took me the longest to do of the four (about 15 hours total) but ended up only being less than 20 lines of Python. Most of it was trying to make sense of what the exploit was doing from reading a couple white papers and figuring out how to code it. \n\nWe had the option to either take an optional final exam or complete and extra assignment for 10% extra credit! You could choose 1 of 3 projects. I chose one that was an extension of the second official project in the class and only took me an hour and about 4 lines of Python code. Another one that looked interesting involved doing a port scan of the entire IPv4 address space for vulnerabilities. \n\nIf you liked the IT Security class you will like this one. The professor and TA\u2019s were very helpful. It is very similar in workload and content and very easy. I haven\u2019t got my final grade but I would guess ending up near 105% with the extra credit. I am nearly done with the program, and this is by far the absolute worst class I have taken. I strongly recommend you stay away. \n\nTo be honest - I have learned NOTHING. Nothing at all. The assignments take a lot of time, and you follow weird cryptic instructions and make the program output whatever its supposed to, but I don't know WHAT is really going on in any of the assignments. It's seriously unreal. \n\nWith the exception of 1 - the TAs are atrocious. They do not help students understand what is to be done. Many of the assignments had huge errors in the provided skeleton code, and TAs dont even address it, other than commenting 10 threads deep as a response to other students proposed solutions. If they cant get their assignments together, how can they expect students to complete them?\n\nThe professor didn't leave a single - not one - email or announcement or comment or anything. He could be mythical for all I know. \n\nIf you actually want to learn something, i suggest staying far, far away. This class is a complete joke and should be either completely revamped or removed from the program. A total waste of my summer that i could have spent in another course that is positively learning oriented, I really enjoyed this class. As someone who entered with no background in security except for CS 6035, this class was very challenging but also very rewarding. I really hope additional security classes and a specialization can be developed before I graduate. For new students prepare by knowing python. You will also be using a Virtual machine so knowing how to setup file transfer between host and guest, basic Linux commands and bash will save you time. The negatives were \n\n1. There was no word from the assigned professor the entire semester. \n2. All but one TA was consistently responsive. This class was my ninth class in OMSCS. I paired it with Graduate Algorithms. I found the beginning of this course to have a lot of overlap with Intro to Info Sec. After the first month or so it the content did branch away from Info Sec. This class is structured very similarly to Info Sec. Mainly project based. Final exam. Quizzes. I found the projects to be pretty easy (usually finished them in a day) but very insightful. I enjoyed learning from the projects. The lectures were harder to learn from. Just like Info Sec the professor tries to teach too much in every video - makes it hard to focus. Plus, I never found a connection between the videos and the projects. The quizzes and videos quickly begin to feel like busy work. I think this class would be better if it had one more project and dropped either the final exam or the quizzes. During the semester I took the class we had a month for the last project. So this would be a good class to pair with another class that has a lot of work towards the end of the semester. I also wish the TAs would have graded things with a little more care. I had to submit regrade requests for every project. Also, the project's instructions were really hard to follow sometimes.\n\nOverall, a good class if you are new to security. Probably easier if you take Info Sec first.  Awful class. Assignments were terrible and were incredibly difficult to figure out what on earth was going on. Like the other commenters posted, I didn't learn anything at all. Based on reviews prior to Summer, I would assume this course has been revamped quite a bit, as it sounds like it used to be an effective course. I can assure you that this is no longer the case. \n\nI am bitter because this class was an laughable waste of time. I dont have much time, and I am actually taking these courses because I want to learn and grow - the TAs absolutely did not care if you learned or not. They did not care to teach, or even fix their own issues on their assignments. Many times, questions students had were usually responded with \"read the writeup again\" (that was NOT clear at ALL, hence the flood of questions) or even in one case \"do not ask questions or you will get a honor code violation\". \n\nI was not active on the slack channel, but I can assure you that the professor never commented once in Piazza. I just did a search to be sure, and NOTHING showed up. Just frustrating. \n\nTAs and Professor did not show any sort of enthusiasm or care at all as to the learning outcomes of this class. i would have learned more if i just read a few articles on wikipedia about security for 10 minutes than i had this entire course. I took this course without a security background and did fine. The lectuer quizzes had nothing to do with the taught content presented and required some googling to complete. During my semester, the course was under development and we often had to wait for lectures to be released. Additionally the TAs were disorganized. I found the course assignments interesting. The content of the course seemed interesting, and I believe that Dr. Lee probably would be an excellent and knowledgeable resource, if available.\n\nThe TAs had poor organization, and frequently provided updates to the project instructions as errors or inconsistencies were found.\n\nThe suggested background knowledge (Java / C) was inapplicable, and instead the course required Python and pretty in-depth web programming ( JavaScript / Asynchronous Interactions w/ HTML ) knowledge.\n\nThe course policies changed mid-course (e.g., Quizes were 'take as many times as you like' to 'single pass' part way through).  The authors of the final exam used vague words (many, often, relative comparitors) for multiple choice and true / false questions which seemed VERY nuanced and specific (e.g., referencing 1 of 20 attacks studied in the course to remember a single facet of that attack) without access to any notes, etc.\n\nDirect questions to the TA (non-complaining) were not answered, projects and grades were generally released late. The topics are interesting when you start looking at them, but the projects just make most of the people lose focus on the content and instead turn to fixing installations and errors that will prevent you from actually understanding them. You will have to learn a lot of things and technologies you won't likely be familiar with before actually starting your projects and understand what could be wrong when you get errors or not the proper result. It would be nice if topics or projects had some connection as you are just finishing understanding one of the topics when you are already into a totally different project (and topic) where only a couple of people will be aware and help others on Piazza. Expect long times when requesting regrades. Instructions for the projects are sometimes not so clear and if the instructions say something like: \"Write down a multiple of 2 (i. e. 4)\" and you write 8, they will be expecting a 4, not an 8, so read the instructions very carefully. I really wanted to like this class because I was very interested in network vulnerabilities and zero-day attacks. I watched all the lectures, did all the assignments, and tried my hardest to gain some value from the course, but it was pretty futile. The professor is completely disengaged and unfortunately, the main TA this year was pretty rude and unforgiving to a lot of people who asked questions on Piazza. I would rate this course a Very Hard in terms of understanding what is actually expected of you, but Easy in terms of actual content.\n\nHonestly, the assignments were not challenging as long as you read every single Piazza post, even if there were dozens. Because I did not do that and just did the assignments as outlined on the assignment description (generally taking around 10 hours for each assignment), without fail, I would receive anywhere from 50-70% on every assignment, and then be forced to request a regrade and claw back points. Every regrade gave me 20+ points, so they are definitely worth it, but it is an absolutely ridiculous process if you think about the effort TAs have to put in to basically grade everything twice because they were not explicit in the assignment instructions the first time or their autograder was just wrong. \n\nYou would think since this class is so poorly managed, that you would be allowed to ask clarifying questions on Piazza, but after one TA repeatedly responded in a downright rude manner to anyone's innocent questions, I decided to forgo that strategy and just rely on the obnoxious regrading requests to get an accurate grade.\n\nAlso don't expect the final to be any less vague or subjective than the quizzes you do all semester. It had many typos, many ambiguous or contentious answers, and was hands-down the worst final I have taken at OMSCS (disclaimer: I have only taken 3 other finals). If you really want to learn network security, just buy the Hacker's Playbook and skip this course. This was my second course in the program and I took it as a continuation of Computer Networks (which I really liked). I thought that transitioning from CN (which touches on network security) would be beneficial and relatively smooth. My conclusion: This class needs a lot of improvement to be on par with the rest of the quality classes found in the program.\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe class is heavily based on projects (5). Additionally there are weekly quizzes (10), and a final exam.\n\n**PROS**\n\n* Topics are interesting and relevant to today's \"cloud\" environments.\n* Projects are engaging and provide opportunities to practice hands-on learning.\n* Piazza was very active and students were very engaged in discussing the presented topics.\n* Helps you appreciate the importance of network security.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* Professor is completely absent from the class.\n* Video lectures were often too shallow to really describe the topics.\n* Project descriptions and write-ups are confusing and often contain grammatical and spelling mistakes.\n* Only one TA is very actively engaged in the discussions, while the rest are often MIA.\n* Grading mistakes were made that required regrade requests.\n\nThe saving grace for the class is that the majority of students are smart and experienced technology professionals who are able to provide thoughtful discussions throughout the course. However, as it stands I can't recommend this class. The content of the course is very interesting and worth learning but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  Taking this class in the summer might be a different experience from regular semesters. The class is run by the TAs, most of them very engaged with the assignments on Piazza and Slack. The content is interesting and timely, we were studying malware by the time wannaCry was released!, The assignments are not complex but some will challenge you and will ask you to think\u200b in more creative ways to achieve results. As constructive feedback, this class needs a better video format, it's basically the professor reading the slides, and make the auto-graders a little smart, you get a lot of deductions that will weight in your final grade, because of trivial problems like file names and spelling. If you have to major in Networking, then you can stop reading this review. If you don't, this is a very badly run course. Here are the reasons why you shouldn't take this course.\n1. The lectures are extremely dry. It's like Prof. Lee has taken a text book and simply read the contents on there.\n2. The lectures are simply a mish mash of materials. Just a bunch of concepts thrown in.\n3. The TAs are not very active. The ones that are provide confusing and sometimes contradictory answers. \n4. The project writeups are mostly poorly written, requiring lots of clarifications from TAs. Almost all projects (except the first) had lots of clarifications, some coming as late as  a couple of days before submission. So if you are the early bird types, forget about submitting early.\n5. There is no autograder you have access to - no way for you to know if you've made a silly mistake in your project. Given that it's binary grading (you either get all points for a section or lose it all), you simply are out of luck if you made a silly mistake. Especially if you made that mistake early on, you basically get a 0. \n\nMy advice is to stay away from this course. I feel like I wasted an entire term and learned very little.  I thought this course would be easy and an A since I really needed one. But I was wrong I took this in the summer so there are naturally less points available to score. This class is a lot of work the material is not particularly hard or complex but it will take time to complete the projects and \nthey are not straightforward. This was my 4th class in the OMSCS program, and I took it as a standalone class this semester. This course is a followup to Info Sec with the same instructor and same style. There were 5 projects, a midterm, and a final. The lectures felt very fast-paced and covered a broad subject at a shallow level, so it was hard to actually learn much from them. I agree with another student that the projects were somewhat disconnected from the lectures. Some of the projects even felt like they really belonged in Info Sec - as if the professor didn't accomplish everything he wanted to in that class, so he's using Network Security as a place to put the overflow. The professor's involvement in the class was minimal - I was active a few times in Slack, and often on Piazza, but I never saw any activity from Prof. Lee in either place, which is disappointing. The class was instead run (somewhat haphazardly) by TAs. The quizzes were poorly or ambiguously worded, sometimes such that there was more than one technically correct answer. Project writeups were often filled with errors or inconsistencies, which had to be resolved on Piazza, and unfortunately made the projects a bit harder to tackle since it was hard to distinguish parts you didn't understand from parts that were just wrong. Project skeleton code had typos that made one wonder if the TAs had actually tried to run the code before publishing it. The autograders were also poorly written, and many students (myself included) had to request regrades for one or more projects due to autograder issues.  Overall, could be a good class with interesting material, but feels poorly executed. Very easy class. 4 required assignments, all were pretty easy to complete. Additionally there was multiple opportunities to get extra credit. \n\nI ended up with a A without doing any extra credit or watching the lectures. While it was a nice break, I'm a little disappointed I didn't learn more. Easy if you know basic python. Lectures shallow and don't really cover the material in detail. Projects changed from time of release until deadline.\n\nStill I enjoyed the course since I've got a lot of interest in network security and had very little knowledge of the subject when I started the course. This is the worst class that I have taken with OMSCS so far.  The lectures are shallow and not explained well.  Its clear the professor was just going though the motions to get the material out.  The professor was completely absent from the class, not one appearance.  The administration of the materials was (poorly) handled by TAs.  I gave a medium difficulty rating, but not because the material is hard.  The difficulty is navigating the twisted, convoluted and sometimes contradictory information given.  I would not recommend this class.  GATech needs to redo the class with a prof that cares about the students. I learned a fair amount in this class, but I agree with others that it was fairly easy. You could probably do all the quizzes without even watching the videos. The homework assignments weren't too difficult, and pretty interesting. I didn't take the Intro To Info Sec class as a prereq, and had no problem with this class (for those that might consider doing the same thing). I thought the piazza interaction was good as well, and grading turnaround was pretty good. This class was way too easy. I am in the network security industry, so this review may be biased. The 4 projects took about 10 hours.. total. I did not watch any of the lectures. I ended up with over 100% in the class. This class seriously needs to be re-vamped to make it more difficult. in fall 2016 there were no exams and the projects were super interesting. there wasn't a lot of additional reading other than for the completing the projects. This is one of the first courses I have taken in OMS. I'm not sure whether I would recommend it as a first course for other students or not (if you have some sec. background it might not be too bad). Most of the project writeups have been quite confusing, and in many cases (for 3 out of 4 projects so far) the TAs have had to make major updates to the projects and/or requirements the while the students were working on them. We have also had some serious issues with autograders this semester that have caused a lot of headaches for students and staff. Fortunately, when issues arise the TAs have been pretty flexible and understanding for the most part. Some TAs have been much more responsive and helpful than others (shout-out to William Lucas for always being helpful on Slack and Piazza!), but overall I get the impression that there isn't a lot of communication amongst all the TAs. The content and the projects are a lot of fun and super interesting though and I have definitely learned a lot! I took this course along with Intro to Operating systems and ML and eventually dropped ML after mid-term. My comments are mixed. First of all this is a graduate course, some topics on computer science are vague and does not have formal algorithms or proofs to learn from, this is one such course. You will apply your computer science skills on this course, so like others mentioned here lecture videos are shallow, skimmed through and covered lot of topics.  If you are research oriented, curious to dig through then this course is for you.  Its overwhelming to do 10 quizzes, 1 final and 5 projects. If you are new to security you will spend lot of time like me but in the end you will feel that you learned something from projects.  Initially i had to juggle 3 courses, so i ended up blowing up on 1 assignment which had a big impact on my grades. TAs were very comfortable on regrade requests and did their best. It appears that materials have changed from past semesters, so if you are new to computer security and expect to learn from course videos and apply it to projects, you are not going to like this course. Its true that professor did not show up but i doubt that it would have made any difference due to the nature of the course. If you have hacking mindset and willing to dig through and learn on your own then you will enjoy this course. Don't assume this course is going to be easy, be prepared to put in solid effort if you care for good grade. In terms of programming language, this course needs some understanding on C, javascript, html, python and firewall rules Not easy. Not very difficult. Interesting projects. Definitely not just 5 hours a week. Twice that. \nAdvice: Practice python, and get used to Virtual box (sharing drives, resizing disk spaces, etc. - Ubuntu, Debian) Also unlike some other posts, I liked this class. While it isn't a difficult class, I thought is was challenging enough and really required you to learn a wide variety of topics related to security. It is a lab/project driven class, so you will spend a lot of time working on projects. If you complete all the assignments and take the extra credit test, you should get a good grade. The lectures are simple and short, but it you really want to learn a topic you will need to complete the readings. While it did suffer some \"new class\" organization issues (it is only the second semester offered), it looks like the professor and TA's are really working to clean up these issues. Overall I think it is a good class to take, especially if you are looking for hands on experience in the network security area. CS-6262 is my first course at GaTech (online), and the course was disheartening. I was very motivated and wanted to excel. I watched every single weekly video and read all suggested materials. I took many notes and was very serious. However, this course is a complete pleasantry. Let me explain.\n\n1) The weekly videos are someone reading the slide without giving any content. The slides are extracted from whitepapers and mostly just the first paragraph of each subject. The videos do not explain; they give outlines of many topics.\n\n2) Each week has too many covered subjects. It's tough to understand everything with the lack of material. Whitepapers are not clear, long to read and a lot of additional web research is required. Videos took me about 1h on average to consume and white papers about 10h. The remaining time was invested in projects.\n\n3) Projects are not related to the lectures. In fact, the projects cover one topic of about 30 discussed in the three weeks the project cover.\n\n4) TAs only answer project answers. Several questions about whitepapers were never answered.\n\n5) Projects are not well constructed. Lots of information are given during the timeframe of the assignment making people working late on the project with a considerable advantage. Some projects requirements were written over +70 PowerPoint slides.\n\n6) Quiz answers are all available on Internet. \n\n7) Final tests are made to trick you. Many questions were related to a subject seen, but the question was touching an area not covered by the lecture. You had to know about the subject deeply to answer. The final exam had many errors (English and structural).\n\n8) Projects worth the most in this course. 5 of them took between 20 to 45 hours to complete. Spread over 2-3 weeks per project it becomes a burden with the whitepapers and videos. The two combined explain why I have an average of about 22 hours per week.\n\n9) Prof Lee is entirely absent from this course. The TAs are doing their best, but they are swamped by assignments questions which prove the lack of cleanliness as well as the disconnect between the material and the projects.\n\n10) They mention buying a book (200 pages). After reading half of it, I realized that it was a waste of time and money. There was a single page that was barely usable for a single project. A student asked about the book and no TA, neither the professor answered about how important was the book was for the class.\n\nIt was my first course, and if GaTech is running this way, I'll stop. The quality is deficient of this course, and it is evident that there was no real intention to teach anything else than cramping a lot of subjects in little time to make it hard. I do not see the point. I put the difficulty to hard only because of the lack of cohesion between the assignments, the lectures and the project. The content is not hard per say, but it is built to make you fail. This class consists of 4 assignments, each worth 25% of the total class grade each. As a bonus, there is an optional project and final exam worth 10% each, but only one of them counts towards your grade. There is not currently much reason to watch the lectures exept to prepare for the final exam, however I personally think they may add some tests/quizzes to future runs of the course. \n\nThe 4 assignments that are all very different. \n\nThe first targets \"advanced web security\". You write code to exploit a fictitious website and also write a Chrome plugin to guard against certain exploits. I found this assignment quite fun. \n\nThe second assignment involves running malware on a VM and examining how it behaves. The entire assignment can probably be done in a single (multi-hour) session. It was quite easy and somewhat interesting. \n\nThe third assignment involves writing IPS/IDS rules using snort to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. This asignment was the most difficult for me and it seemed to cause issues for others as well. Writing snort rules was not particularly hard, but the way the assignment was presented was pretty vague. After prodding the TA we were given some, but not enough in my opinion, additional information. In particular, we were asked to write rules \"with a long shelf life\". There was some comedy here when some of the \"benign\" traffic that was sampled included browsing an adult e-commerce store. Somebody complained and they issued alternate traffic to analyze for those who were offended. \n\nThe last assignment was somewhere between the first and second in terms of effort and required using an ML toolkit to analyze network traffic. Most of the code was provide to us, but it does take some time to figure out how things are setup. The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing an algorithm that was laid out in an academic paper. \n\nThis class is a decent option to fill a Computing Systems concentration requirement. I don't know why so many people rated this class easy. It was not. It took significant work effort. If you have a fulltime job (60 hours per week) and a family with children, this is about all you can take in a class. I had to drop my second class. That said, what you learn is tremendous. This is totally worth the effort. Recommend you take Computer Networks and Intro to Info Security first so you have the right background. A useful course that builds upon ICS, but one with its faults. As mentioned in other reviews, the Professor was completely absent this Summer semester. Fortunately, the TA's were engaged and helpful, but that's not a full replacement. The lectures themselves are pretty barebones with all kinds of discontinuities, jumps, and quizzes that don't always make sense, but the lectures do adequately cover the core materials. The assignments are relevant and I found them doable (but then I lucked out and found an easy solution for the infamous \"frame buster\"). I enjoyed playing the \"black hat\" and defeating machine-learning intrusion detection systems and aggressively probing network hosts. \n\nThere are few things more important in practical CS than network security, and so this course is something of a missed opportunity. You'll learn here, but not as much as you could. Professor don't appear in course. You have to study yourself if you want to understand things. Unlike others who posted comments here, I liked this course. Yes the lectures can get boring sometimes due to the nature of the material. But, the readings are great if you have time to read them. The topics are relevant to today's cyber security environment and also covers recent research in this area. Some papers go really in depth in the topic like how DNS works, etc. You also learn to use machine learning to check for network anomaly and then to bypass it which is cool. Assignments can be annoying since they require specific answers to the questions. Some assignments took more than 40+ hours to complete due to this. I suggest instructors to make the assignment more flexible and grading flexible too. If you want to learn in this course you will (provided you do the readings and assignments) and if you want to just pass it you can (but may not learn much!) Fairly good course as far as work load and interesting projects go. The information presented in class doesn't really apply to the projects but they're do-able using google and occasionally TAs for some guidance. The TA was pretty harsh this semester but there were also a lot of ups and downs with students so I sort of get it. Instructor was non-existent. Exam was hard at the end just because it was over ALL class information and was very short the questions felt random and it was easy to feel unprepared. However, I still feel like I took something from the class (especially the projects) and finally at least 50% understand bitcoin. PS - Project 2 sucks, just ride it out, the rest are fine. This class was executed so poorly. I agree with what a lot of people said previously. The professor didn't make 1 appearance in Piazza. TAs ran the class, poorly. Some projects were easy, some really hard. \n\n*Poorly written assignments\n*Strict auto-grader\n*Slow project grading\n*Horrible communication skills with TAs about projects, especially the 4th and 5th project This class had some issues for a first run, but ultimately was a positive experience, especially for those pursuing computing systems specializations. The problems were mainly with pacing of the course and specifics with the project details. There were many dead spots throughout the semester and the projects had evolving instructions / descriptions. I expect these issues to be worked out in subsequent semesters. For those who have taken InfoSec, This course is VERY similar. \n\nLots of opportunities for extra credit, some of the projects are reminiscent of Info Sec as well. The class was project based, with each of 4 projects worth 25% of the grade. Up to 10% extra credit was available through an additional project or PT exam. Overall fairly easy to score very well provided you don't biff more than one project. \n\nProjects focused on web security (similar to InfoSec, JavaScript), network based malware analysis (also similar to InfoSec), Network Monitoring (used Snort and Wireshark) and using ML techniques for anomalous traffic detection (no previous ML experience required, Python). \n\nThe slack study group and other students were particularly helpful on Piazza, and the Teaching staff did what they could to help students and generally were responsive and helpful. As is becoming the norm, the Professor was less present as Prof. Lee now has multiple classes running here in OMS as well as the terrestrial requirements at GT. This did not present a problem. \n\nThere is no required textbook, but taking InfoSec first is listed as a pseudo requirement. While it will make your life here very very easy to take Info Sec first, you can probably get through it without doing that if you have a CS background and have ever dealt with security in a job. \n\nOverall I would recommend taking the class. Well done, and plays well with other classes (in its current incarnation). The course is interesting, but the projects are very frustrating. \n\nThe course is completely led by the TAs, other than the pre-recorded videos I don't think the professor contributed anything on Piazza etc. In some classes this can work, but not so well in this case as there was a lack of clear guidance when there was an anomaly. \n\nI did learn quite a bit and what I did learn was interesting. The assignments were painful in terms of having to work through incorrect or ambiguous instructions. In some projects then there would be a comment in Piazza that clarified something or corrected an error but that would be late into the project and in some cases meant repeating the project. It also meant that you had to spend a lot of time on Piazza, not just reading every post once but going back to see if an instructor had added a comment at a later date. I spent a lot of time re-working the projects which I feel was time wasted. For one of the projects it is still ambiguous as to why we had to do something a particular way and it has not been explained despite several attempts at asking. \n\nIn addition one project involving zmap Internet scanning resulted in many students being flagged by the IT department as performing unauthorized Internet scanning. This is something that should have been cleared with them in advance by the professor. It left students unable to complete the assignment, although they were given an alternative quiz afterwards it was very poorly handled. \n\nIn summary it is an interesting course and I did learn a lot from it, but the projects were very poorly handled in terms of incorrect instructions and ambiguities.", 
    "CS-6263": " The class topic is very cool. The projects are good for learning about the Industrial Control System Environments. What makes the class more difficult is that there are only 5 gradable events. There is a midterm that had 19 questions total. (I mean, miss 3 and you are at a C-), and 3 projects, plus a Final. The questions on the midterm were somewhat ambiguous which left me very nervous. I liked the first project on Ladder Logic. The Second was Modbus, and I ran out of time because of conflicting project schedules with CS6262 Network Security. I ended up having to drop this one here in the Spring, but will look to redo in the summer. It is a good topic, but overall, I wish the exams had more questions so it had better coverage of the material and less \"gotcha\" ambiguous questions. And actually, I wish there were more projects too. Some parts of the class go a long time with simply reading a chapter and watching a lesson. Even smaller projects would be good here and cement the material. this is a good class, it provides good lectures, good books and reasonable projects. the issue is that the exams which represent 50% of the final grade are short multiple choice / true & false. The material is interesting. the semester didn't provide an active piazza or slack channel. So it's really about keeping up with the class. Office hours weren't recorded which is a definite bummer if you do work on the program late at night. Felt to be more of an survey of Industrial Control Systems and protocols than a security course. We periodically touched on security here/there, but much more of the focus was on a very wide brief introduction to a wide variety of systems and protocols with a never ending list of acronyms. I would have preferred much more time spent on the application of security (e. g. here's a situation... this is what was done to secure it... or here's an case where there was an exploit, this is what was done to discover it, this is how it could have been discovered earlier, this is what was done to fix it -- in other words, learning from other's mistakes and analysis). \n\nThe projects were very lightweight and completed with minimal time and effort. Others had trouble getting the systems up/running, but I did not have that issue. \n\nThe other half of the grade for the course is tied up in hair-splitting true/false questions on two tests (both of which have a fairly limited number of questions). \n\nI think the course needs some work to take some slices of it deeper and give up on some of the broadness of the topics covered. As others have stated, this is a bad course, and the worst security course in OMSCS (I have taken all the other ones before this). The professor clearly doesn't put any effort into the class or the tests. The projects are hard to interpret, but not too bad once you get past the setup time. \n\nThe real issue I had with this class were the tests. They are about 20 multiple choice questions that are terribly worded with answers that all make sense depending on the context that you do not have. Its more or less his opinion really, so you have to spend a ton of time trying to figure out what he believes is the best answer and not what is actually the best answer. \n\nTAs were good. They had to deal with almost all aspects of the class because the professor was non-existant but they did a good job with that overall. I strongly recommend not taking this class, even if you want an easy A. Its not worth the time or effort you will spend. An easy but rewarding course. The projects are perhaps a bit too easy, but I found the material and reading itself very rewarding. Gives me a new perspective on talk of 'cyberwar' in the news. I would strongly recommend reading the academic papers assigned - although they weren't so relevant to the projects/exams, they were sometimes far more interesting than the textbooks. \n\nMy only complaint is easiness of the class - some of the projects definitely did not feel rigorous, especially in their programming component. But others may disagree, just my two cents. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this class, but definitely as a second class in addition to something else more challenging. Overall, a good class. Yes, the lectures and books were often repetitive and some rote learning was involved. And yes, the professors and TA's weren't very active on Piazza. But the material was interesting and you get the understanding about what makes cyber security different for embedded systems versus general purpose systems. In contrast to what a previous reviewer said, when the professor said \"I won\u2019t debate you further. However, for the other students reading this, my statements were correct, \" I thought it was great. The student was arguing for the point of arguing on the Piazza forums, adding unneeded contention. And I didn't really see any other students surprised or \"roiled up\" by that comment. Anyways, back to the class itself. Enjoyed it, and wasn't a bad class to take during the shorter summer semester. Until theres a restructure, I would avoid this course. Unfortunately, its a poor reflection of the OMSCS program and hopefully the feedback on OMSCentral will be used to improve the course.\n\nThere is almost no interaction between the instructors/TA and students on Piazza -- it was the least amount of Piazza/Slack activity I've observed so far in this program. There's pretty much nothing due for the first 4 weeks, then there's an extremely simple project that is made difficult through lack of clarity. After that, there's nothing due for a few more weeks until the Midterm that contains less than 20 multiple choice questions and is worth 25% of your grade. There is no direction on what to study, because the assessments are meant test the student's broad understand. This has the side effect of questions that are vague and open for interpretation, allowing multiple technically correct answers to some questions based on the level of abstraction of your interpretation. The books are just a really general overview of the topic. This course takes only a few hours of work per week to complete in its current state, and when the appropriate amount of effort is put forth, it will give you a 50% chance at a B, and 50% chance at an A. \n\nThe instructor is likable and he does a good job with the lectures, so that is one benefit. The instructor is knowledgeable in his field, just as you'd expect from a GA Tech professor.\n\nThis review isnt in retaliation for a bad grade, or a personal attack on any of the instructors; I received an A, and the instructors were willing to help a student when contacted. My theory is that outside of the lectures, the course was developed and operated by TAs from the brick and mortar program who just don't have much stake in the online program. I'd love to see this course improved upon. This was the first semester this class was offered. It covered a wide range of topics from general network security, industrial control systems and programming in ladder logic. It is a lot of material and overall it is very interesting. The grading was fair and was based on 3 projects and 2 tests. \n\nThe tests were short, multiple choice and T/F tests. In general I ended up studying all the material for a very long time only to spend 5 to 10 min on each test. The testing on ladder logic was not done well since there was no effort to give partial credit. This I feel is important when testing knowledge of a programming language. \n\nThe projects were the best part of the course, but still fell short of providing that much challenge in the class. The actual tasks pertaining to the material were quite easy, but sometimes it was the preparation that took the longest. My feelings after taking the class were that homework should be given each week to introduce the students to the technologies they will be using, like VirtualBox, Wireshark and the ladder logic emulator. Therefore the projects could involve more of the class material and less learning about the project environment. \n\nLastly, TA involvement on Piazza was good. They were there to answer questions or concerns. Since the class grading involved only 5 assignments Piazza was quiet most of the semester. \n\nI would like to see this class improve since the material is current and well-delivered. There should be some attempts to make the delivery focus more on the projects and less on the tests. The instructor (Raheem Beyah) keeps his syllabus on his website at\nhttp://users. ece. gatech. edu/~rbeyah/classes/fall2016/cs8803/ (substitute your term as appropriate)\n\nGrading summary: \n2 projects @ 25% each\nMidterm & Final @ 25% each, via ProctorTrack (T/F, MC)\n\nProject 1 was PLC ladder logic programming\nProject 2 analyzing ethernet traffic and using Python to inject bad commands\nProject 3 researching vulnerable devices\n(All projects are individual; no group projects)\n\nPace is slow, so a great class to take along side another. I'm taking CS6035 concurrently. This class does not require CS6035 as a prereq - it can stand on its own. The content is interesting and worthwhile. There haven't been any office hours, but the TAs and instructor monitor Piazza well. Granted we only have ~50 students in the class during its 1st run. \n\nEdit: updated review after finishing the class Overall a great class! It has some issues, but fortunately they are ones I think will be resolved in future iterations of the course. \n\nThe course stands alone very well, and covers the necessary background material needed to be successful without needing to take other classes. If you have taken CN, InfoSec, and NetSec, you will find much of the material to be review. What is unique to this class is how this pertains to the realm of cyber physical systems like Programmable Logic Controllers, and how these devices are used in a conventional industrial plant. \n\nThis semester the course had 3 projects, each taking between 5-8 hours to complete. Each focused on it's own area - Ladder Logic Programming, Industrial Protocols, and exploiting vulnerabilities in CPS. There was a one hour midterm consisting of multiple choice and T/F style problems. I have yet to take the final, but it is 3 hours long, has a similar format and length to the midterm, and is comprehensive. We are permitted to use a single sheet of notes for the tests. \n\nThe material spends a lot of time focusing on definitions of terms, policies, and best practices. It uses common terminology, so much of it will be familiar, just applied to a new realm. The videos are high quality, easy to understand, and you can tell Professor Beyah was well rehearsed and polished for their production. There are a few moments where I felt like I was watching the Turbo Encabulator video, but it wasn't too terribly distracting. \n\nThe course also has some pacing issues. With only three short projects, straightforward material, two tests, and ~50 students this semester we probably won't get higher than 300 threads in Piazza. I think the inclusion of meatier projects / more projects is likely to occur, and would benefit the class. \n\nIf you are looking to prepare for the course, you could learn Wireshark if you don't already know how to use it, and potentially buy the books in advance and do some casual reading. I almost never write reviews for courses, but this one is so terrible that I wanted to make sure to warn people. The subject matter is dull and the lectures make it even worse, there are two 'required' books which I never touched, the TAs/professor got combative with people in Pizza on a few occasions, and there was almost no interaction at all.  I mentioned the books.  I never once opened them, but I got an 'A' in the class.  I've no idea what is in them, but clearly it wasn't needed.\n\nBy far, the best part of the course are the projects, but that isn't much of a compliment.  The things are terribly designed, require janky industrial software (seriously, why is industrial software so terrible), and have unclear requirements.  Once you've figured out what you are being asked to do, however, the projects are simple and can be finished in an hour or two.\n\nBeware the exams.  They are easy (like 5-10 minutes easy), but there is often misleading wording to questions.\n\nIs this an easy class?  Yes.  Does it require much thought or time?  No.  Will you still be sad you took it?  Very much so.  \n Fairly simple, but assumes a moderately broad basis of knowledge. A little programming would help, and a fair bit of information security, and a bit of networking. If you have that, it's a short time commitment for several assignments and two exams. It was nice that it was fairly new material. One of my favorite classes, and I learned a good bit despite it not being labor intensive. Had A's straight through, despite doing the assignments entirely later than I should have. SHITTIEST COURSE! A BIG WASTE OF TIME & MONEY. \n\nThis is not a Master level class. It does not teach you how to think, analyze, or reason with logic. Instead, it asks you to memorize concepts, protocols, and several shameless plugs from the instructor. \n\nDon't let the first few videos fool you with that hard yellow hat or the substation in the background into thinking the instructor is passionate about the class. On the contrary, you rarely see him participating. There was a question from a student and he condescendingly answered \"I'm not going to debate with you but for other students, my statements were right. \" That surprised and roiled up many students. If there's anything you'd learn in this class, unprofessional attitude is surely one. \n\nThe remaining of the videos are paraphrases from books, with a bunch of fundamental errors sprinkled in for taste. You're expected to remember all of that, including misinformation. \n\nThe mini projects (i. e. homework) are ill prepared. Unlicensed Windows, outdated software, non-working environment, etc. These issues were reported in earlier semesters but none bothered to fix them. The staffs just don't give a f*ck. And the previous sentence is my only review about the staffs. \n\nThe exams, as mentioned before, expect much rote-learning. But questions are badly written. In a true/false setting, most questions can go either way depending on the (missing) context. There is no way to reason them out, even security pros fail to match the answers. The final is especially terrible. Scheduled for ~3 hours, many completed in ~3 minutes. This class obviously does not meet any educational standard. \n\nTo recap, taking this class would set you back a few steps on your way to a good job. There are better security classes in the OMSCS program. But please do take this class if learning-by-rote is your kinda thing and you want to sell security to your boss. This class is easy and has enough spins for that. This class has a lot of potential that goes largely untapped. The professor runs the lectures of the course nearly directly from a technical book, with his preferences emphasized. It sometimes feels more like a survey of a wide range of industrial control topics with an emphasis on the power grid. The problem is that it's a poorly written book in both language and conceptual layout. For example, you find repetition of facts at the beginning, middle, and end - but all high level concepts without specifics. \n\nTechnical papers the professor wrote were more interesting than anything in the book, and I wish the professor focused more on his work instead of the book - \"Industrial Network Security\". There was a little bit of opinion/politics thrown into a couple lecture - and this is my ultimate pet peeve. \n\nNot too much detail on most topics or specific technical challenges like you will find in nearly every other OMSCS course. Two of the three projects allow for a slightly deeper dive, but still not what you would expect from your average GT graduate course. The instructor did post a few things throughout the semester on piazza, but TA involvement was puzzling. Although the TAs do answer random questions, you definitely get the feeling that the TAs have a lot better things to do than answer questions on piazza. Even with that our TAs still really seem like great people, and I liked them. \n\nThe hardest part of the course is having so few grading events. There are two tests and three projects. And the tests are not long, so you have to make each grade count. \n\nI write a review for every class I take, and this will be the first negative review for any class. That probably speaks to the strength of OMSCS. It's not a BAD class, per se, but it does not stand up to many of the others. And that's a pretty high bar. Let's start with good cop- the lectures are fairly alright. The problem is that the course is a long, extensive enumeration of a bunch of things that you should memorize (snooze-triggering videos on the details of various protocols used in industrial control systems) and then the exams do a very poor job in measuring the extent to which you've absorbed that information. So what's the point? I hate courses that function like a laundry list of concepts to memorize, but if they can't even write unambiguous exam questions based on that list, the course is garbage. (Additionally, the lectures are just a condensed version of the book readings, rendering the readings redundant and unnecessary. ) The projects were poorly explained and there was much reliance on the student Slack channel for project setup (hint: project setup is like 90% of the work for the projects). To top it all off, the instructor was either unengaged or condescending. The course is technically \"easy\" in terms of workload and subject matter, but I would imagine that most people got B's just due to there being few grading events that don't measure your understanding very well. I just finished the final in less than three minutes, having settled on an end goal of getting over half of the T/F questions correct for a B (the A being unattainable or not worth it due to crap questions). The worst course I've taken in the program and could use some strong changes. Not sure how fall semester was but I took this in Spring semester and it was an awful awful class. I had to withdraw since my first midterm grade was very poor and the instructor had no intentions of giving a curve even though the class average was failing! Nobody got an A on the first exam and the exam did a poor job of gauging my understanding of the material since it was all T/F questions with 3 ineligible Multiple choice questions (we could not see the diagrams properly). Despite all of the students complaints, the instructors simply ignored them and moved on. On top of that, we never even got the answer key for the first exam so I don't know what I got wrong (or could argue for any points back). \n\nThe mini projects could be fun; however, the lectures do not show how to solve them at all. I was very stuck on both thus far, not because it was necessarily difficult but because there was little documentation or little knowledge given to us about the project. On top of that, the VMs and instructions provided for the mini projects were very very poor and paltry when it came to details. I had to scour Piazza in order to troubleshoot some of the most basic issues with the VM (for instance, there was an Ubuntu VM given to us that had no taskbar and had I not known the command needed to use in the terminal in Piazza, I would've just been completely stuck). A lot of time is also spent configuring the VM, downloading files/applications, and installing everything just to begin the project - why the instructors/TAs don't do this themselves and then provide the VM is beyond me. \n\nI would strongly suggest to avoid this terrible class. It is sad because the material looks so cool but the lack of structure, direction, and overall unfairness of this class has lead me to believe that this is the worst class I have ever taken as a student (and this was my 8th class in the program).", 
    "CS-6290": " I took this course but dropped at the drop date due to the fact that I was also taking another course. Well for the part I covered (about 55%) the course per se is not extremely hard if you strictly look only at the concepts, what makes it hard are the projects and the exams. In fact even the projects are not too hard, it is the exams I found to be particularly different from all other courses. The exams only have problem solving question with some heavy arithmetic. A lot of practice with formulas is necessary. You not only need to know your formulas but the questions will wrong-foot you at every turn. Hardly in real life we get situations where one has to do HPCA arithmetic within a quick turnaround time. And that is what this course's exams are about, doing HPCA arithmetic within allowed time constraints. Well I am not saying the arithmetic is not important but the course turns it into something like a race at Olympics which I think is not necessary. I would say that if you know your formulas well you can do very well in this course sometimes even if you don't understand the concepts well. In fact a high school student can be taught to use the formulas effectively and be made to do well in this course's exams. I did not like the fact that the course's exams only focus on arithmetic even though it is at a graduate level. Great course. I have no background in computer architecture before, therefore It's could be hard at the beginning. But if you got through the course, you will definitely learn a lot a lot. The grades for both project and exam are very generous, I got overall 98 at the end. The leader TA Nolan is awesome! He is the best TA in this program I have ever seen.  I think this course was more difficult that it needed to be. The course covers a ton of material, and only had two exams (second was comprehensive) which made the amount of material to study for both quite staggering, and there were tons of quizzes and problem sets that were picky about rounding/formatting. Office hours weren't recorded for some reason when they were held, and the majority of grades weren't released until after the final was over making it hard to gauge one's progress. The SESC code base used throughout the class is horrific coming from someone who has worked in enterprise for a few years, and sadly the majority of the projects were spent just figuring out what was going on in the code vs. actually implementing and having fun measuring different aspects of the project questions. One project involved modifying the simulator in a file where ~20-30 lines of code directly pertinent to the project didn't even work correctly, and was effectively dead code that misled students. Luckily the main active TA Nolan was awesome, super-responsive to questions and helped clarify a lot of the confusion over Piazza. All lectures were just on a virtual whiteboard with a short intro/outro by the professor, and I would have appreciated a bit more production value like in Computer Vision where there is a mix of slides/camera angles/reading to break the monotony a bit. - First class taken in OMSCS. \n- First time back in school after 15+ years. Was never a very studious person... \n- Married w/ 2 kids under 5, full time job. \n\nThis was my first semester in the program, and I took this class because I was in the middle of nowhere with no Internet for the first 8 hours of my low priority registration window - so I was pretty much forced to take this class. \n\nI thought the lecture videos were done very well. The TA was doing his best to be helpful and was for the most part responsive, but it was clear that he was overworked. The HWs and projects were not graded in a timely manner. Half of the HWs were not graded by the end of the course (though to the TA's credit, he offered to consult individually for students to see where they stand in the course prior to drop date). \n\nThe midterm was pretty difficult. The final was made to be no-notes, no-calculator, and no-scratch paper. The result was that it was a lot of hand-wavy sort of conceptual questions (poorly-worded questions like \"what would be the more likely outcome if... \" sort of questions) - which I do not excel in as indicated in my grade in the final. \n\nThe projects were not too bad if you have previous C++ experience like I did. But I question the usefulness of these projects in learning the concepts. But yes - in the end, you're interpreting thousands of lines of code and changing 10 of them. \n\nI think the biggest problem is that the subject matter was just too academic for me to relate to in terms of generating excitement. And plus it was just drinking from a firehose for 4 months in terms of the amount of material covered during the semester. The subject matter is really quite interesting and you learn a lot about processors. Projects are not hard but tedious to get through because of SESC and its lack of documentation. Grading feedback and general responses on Piazza was very poor and highly intermittent.  This was my first class in the program. While it wasn't a subject I was initially interested in, I learned a lot and had a good experience. The lectures were very clear and well paced. The exams were very much in the spirit of the lectures and were not difficult, although you should study for about week in preparation.\n\nAdditionally, the main TA, Nolan, was incredible. He was very attentive, caring, quick to respond and knowledgable. I was surprised by the amount of collaboration and camaraderie among the class. The other TAs were almost inactive (as far as I could tell. May have done things behind the scenes), however, Nolan was so good it didn't matter.\n\nThe only thing that could be improved were the projects. Each project was essentially running a simulated processor with a test program, tweaking the inputs of the processor, and seeing how it performed differently. Then, there would be a code section were you alter the code of the processor and see how it performs.\n\nThe first section taught me a lot about processors, however, the code portion was more tedious than informative. This is because the simulator is a huge C++ code base that is somewhat poorly written. Most of the time involved in the projects is trying to understand what the code is currently doing. The feedback loop is also very long because running the simulation normally takes about 30 minutes real time.\n\nThe saving grace here is that the TAs allow you to compare results on _a simulation other than the one for the project_. So you can know for sure if you have the right answer.\n\nThis could all be mitigated if the instructions gave you more direct guidance. \"Edit function, foo, so that it does x instead of y.\"\n\nOverall, though, good class, great TA(s). although it is not a easy course, I find the projects helpful. they projects are not very related to the course materials, but rather a complement. The course videos are very good, covering a lot of concepts, and the instructor did a great job explaining abstract concepts very clearly. The videos are one of the best course videos I've seen in OMSCS. (I've taken 8 courses so far) It was an engaging course with a lot of material. This course does assume you have some background in computer architecture and continues on assuming you know some of the basics. The midterms and final are open book but some questions require a significant amount of critical thinking of the topics covered. I would say that overall it is a relatively tough course but definitely doable if you stay on top of the lectures.  Extremely difficult course, I'm glad that I passed it. Overall the course is good, lectures are meaningful, up to date with current technologies and Nolan as a TA was awesome. However the work on projects are tedious and time consuming. The projects are not stimulating at all and I had a hard time bringing myself to doing it. Overall, if you pace yourself properly (and not keep things for the last moment), it is not a difficult class at all. Make good notes throughout the course and keep it handy during exam. Professor allows the notes to be used during exam and it will help you give pointers to solve problems. Instructor is good, material is solid and interesting, exams seemed fair, assignments were frustrating (Largely trying to understand somebody else's simulator, not much understanding of comp arch required). Overall, I recommend the class.  The lectures (and the material they cover) are great if you are even somewhat interested in the low-level design of a modern computer. I thought the exams were mostly well-constructed and representative of the material we learned. However, I didn't care much for the assignments. Reverse-engineering SESC (the CPU simulator used) is neither educational or interesting. I would have learned more if we had built our own simulations of certain architectural pieces (ideally to plug in to well-defined/documented interfaces to a larger simulation) and perhaps written thorough tests for those pieces. All this aside, I think the excellent lectures make the course worthwhile. Note: Professor/TA responses to questions and issues have been problematic for many people.  Exams require good unnderstanding of subject matter and its application, exams are mainly math so you can end up scoring low even if you have prepared well. Projects are not very code intensive but takes a long time to run multiple simulations, simulator is not documented well enoungh and you need to spend considerable amount of time to get started. Overall I enjoyed this class, great class to take if you are interested in systems I did learn a lot in the class. For anyone who took a computer architecture class in undergraduate this class picks up where it left off. Projects take a lot of time, but most of it is from running the simulator multiple times under different conditions. This also means you need an early start on projects because making the wrong code change could take a few hours to figure out your results don't make sense. Exams I believe cover most of the material in the lectures, so there shouldn't be any surprises. Lots of quizzes throughout the lectures to reineforce the material. Overall I'm glad I took it, even if I won't be designing processors I think the techniques used to solve challenges in modern processors are useful for developing new technologies.  The lectures are entertaining. The exams are very detailed, so don't slack on preparation. They are open-note though, and that helps. The projects are not very code-intensive- its mostly understanding the existing simulator code and making some tweaks. The simulations can take a lot of time so you can't procrastinate. The professor does seem a bit overzealous in looking for honor code violations (to the point that most people are too scared to post answers on Piazza), so there is a strange dynamic there.  The thing that sucks the most about this course is that you don't really know how you are doing in it. When we took the final we only had 30% of our overall grade reported back. I dropped this course after the second project/first midterm due to workload of the two courses I was taking (this + CS 7637 meant basically spending all of my time outside of work on OMSCS stuff. It was down to a coin toss which one I dropped). Fantastic lectures and content, but I found that the projects were difficult but in an annoying way - there was a lot of time spent trying to figure out how the underlying simulator works, or what the assignment actually wanted, as opposed to actually applying concepts in the class. Midterm felt difficult but fair. I do plan on taking this course again in the future - it's really interesting, just expect a high workload covering a lot of content.  This class is definitely difficult, moreso than 6210 in my opinion. And, for some reason all of the instructors seem to have completely dissappeard off of the Piazza boards and it's really, really hard to get an answer from anyone (even fellow classmastes). In any case, I REALLY enjoy the content, I think the lectures are really well done, the projects are VERY difficult and involve a deep understanding of the simulator and what is really going on there, even though we have no instructions about how to use the simulator. You have to spend a lot of time just figuring it out on your own. The tests are interesting, they are proctored on proctorU, but you answer all the questions in your browser and submit, not like 6210 in which you had to create a word document and submit it.  This class is fairly tough. It is both broad in scope and deep in individual subject material. If you aren't already well-versed in it, you will learn a TON. It helps if you are already familiar with processor architecture at a high-level (you should have heard the terms pipeline, register, ALU, cache, etc, and have an idea of what they are). You should have encountered MIPS assembly language for the discussions, but you won't need to do any MIPS programming - you just need to understand what the arguments and commands look like and you should be able to pick it up from there. The four assignments (2 individual, 2 with optional partners) will require C++ knowledge, and a VM environment to run the linux VM that contains the simulator (VMWare is recommended). \nI think the class started with something like 160 students, and at last count had around 100 on the roster; although the professor indicated something like 50-60 students turned in the latest assignment, so maybe quite a few more have dropped. If you have any doubts about this class, I would recommend taking it in a semester by itself when you can focus on it.  This class is very challenging, both difficulty and time-wise. The lectures are very good, but the projects have been fustrating and time-consuming. More time is spent trying to understand the poorly documented simulator than demonstrating the concepts. There were a lot of curveballs on the tests also, and you needed very good understanding of the concepts since the problems were often quite different from examples in lectures.  Learning a lot. The midterms are tough. The projects are very useful and hard.  I agree almost completely with a number of the other recent reviews. \n\nThe Pros -- Course material is great - the videos are quite interesting. By the end of it, you learn an amazing amount of material. I seem to be in a minority, but I felt the embedded quizzes were great (despite typos & errors) and really helped to reinforce the course material. You can always hit the skip to answer button if you run into trouble. You got credit for just attempting the quizzes. \n\nThere is a partner option for the last two projects which was great. That became an important channel of communication for working out issues that were not addressed via Piazza. \n\nGenerally positive -- I quite enjoyed the project and felt like the effort level involved was quite reasonable (8-15 hours). If you cannot read C++ or figure out undocumented code you will have trouble. This is a real academic simulator, written by people just trying to get things done; commenting was a secondary concern. The actual coding you do is 20-50 lines, the trouble is just figuring out where they go. Having read horror stories about multi-hour simulations from prior terms, I was pleasantly surprised that the simulations took only a couple of minutes. \n\nThe Major issue (as stated by others) -- was the Piazza interaction with the professor & TAs. Office hours were cancelled for a few weeks, then disappeared altogether. Logistics around projects and exams were poorly communicated. Halfway through the semester instructor (professor / and especially TA) participation fell off a cliff. Shockingly, there was no formal announcement for the Final Exam!\n\nOverall -- the content is great, but be prepared to have to figure things out on your own. Make sure you take the lab partner option as he/she will be one of the best resources to resolve issues that you are unable to post publicly to Piazza.  This class was hard for all the wrong reasons. The instructor was not present at all on Piazza at all during the semester, although he did hold office hours once a week (those were not recorded and I was unable to attend so I can't comment on their usefulness). \n\nAs others have mentioned, the projects aren't hard once you figure out what you need to do. My major difficulty with this class was the sheer amount of material, and the grading structure. 50% of the class was assignments, while the other 50% was tests. I did well on all of the assignments and met or exceeded the class average on the tests and still ended up with a B. The final was cumulative, so it was really hard to decide what to focus your studying on, and there was one concept that I simply didn't dig into when I was studying that came back to bite me. \n\nI didn't end up using the book too much and it's not required. So I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you really want to. \n\nOverall, the material in this course was interesting, but the administration needs some improvement. Still, consider taking it if you're interested in computer architecture. I decided to jump into this program with both feet, taking 6210 and 6290 in my first semester. HPCA was an incredible class and I learned more about computer architecture and optimizations in this class than in my entire undergraduate program. The projects could be hard or easy, depending on your skill with C++, but the grading is fair. I ended up with an A, mostly because of good project performance and spending a solid day before the final working through all the problem sets again. I agree with the other commenters, Nolan was awesome! Pros\nThe content of the class was excellent and the professor presented them very well\nWhen there are problems in regrades and proctor, TAs and professor handled well although not very timely\nOffice hours were very useful for project1 and project2\nCons\nAbsolutely no presence on Piazza after mid-september\nOffice hours didn't happen regularly after september\nOther comments\n- you have to be proficient in C and be able to understand huge code which has no comments to be able to do projects\n- I found the midterm1 content and exam tough. After that the material [cache, coherence and multiprocessor] was very familiar and so found it easy\n- If this is your first course as it was for me in OMSCS, it is a bit frustrating as everything is new to us and the TAs and professors are not very responsive\n- projects are a direct application of the material learnt. After reviewing sample projects in the wiki, I felt our batch got quite easy projects :)\n- All in all, it is a wonderful course, even if you are not specializing in computing systems, it is always useful to understand how processors are designed The Pros -- Course material is great - videos are interesting, funny, and full of content. Minor supplemental reading helped flesh out some of the more challenging topics. Learned a tremendous amount in a quick time. \n\nThe Cons -- the embedded quizzes have frustrating errors at times (typos, looking for specific formats of values, accept only an incorrect answer). Some videos appear missing or incorrectly ordered. \n\nThe Major issue -- Piazza interaction with the professor & TAs was very limited. Office hours were cancelled for a few weeks, then disappeared altogether. Logistics around projects and exams were poorly communicated. \n\nOverall -- great content, but be prepared to learn it with you and your fellow students. Very limited ad hoc teaching support.  Very good course, lecture materials supported the projects. Professor was engaged and the TAs were responsive. Overall a good starting course for ML, though the domain is Finance. Be careful about the projects. Start early because some of them can be tricky. The \"Manual Strategy\" and \"Strategy Learner\" projects are difficult and should be allocated proper time. Challenging yet very rewarding course! Be warned, do not take this if you don't have some OS knowledge or C++ programming experience; the course knowledge is very dense/broad and you will be playing catchup to understand the concepts if you do not have the sufficient background. On the other hand, the course was relatively easy in terms of grading, the exam is way less overwhelming than the actual material taught. The projects require you to understand the concepts and make less than 200 lines of code changes(I think we were required to make changes to less than 8 C++ files total. )\n\nOverall it was a very interesting course imo. Worth taking if you are interested in how modern computers are optimized. I really like this class. It has provided a lot of clarity to what happens where the electrons hit the silicon. It was not difficult, but there is a lot of information to digest. It is the compliation of decades of very clever ideas, all rolled up into a short class. The lectures are well laid out and I was able to watch them at 1. 25x or 1. 5x the speed, depending on whether or not Milos had his coffee before he recorded the session. I enjoyed the coding sessions and I think that the changes we were required to make are close to what you might see in the real world if you were modifying internal simulation software. The most difficult aspect is that there is little guidance as to whether or not the metrics that you find in your projects are the optimal solution. This simulates the real world, where you have to make sure that what you code isn't outputting crap numbers, but makes it difficult to ensure that you get a good grade on every assignment, especially those where you are competing against the other students. Not for the feignt of heart, but a good class full of pretty cool information.  Avoid taking this class! Tests were very unfair. There were some lectures without problem sets that then had exam questions. Professor was not to be bothered regarding additional problems. Overall the professor was hardly on Piazza. Professor would not spend time to create Piazza threads and interact with students. Udacity TA was rude in Piazza in a couple of instances. Would have spent more time on the course if it was presented and maintained better. This course uses ProctorU and is mainly test based (60% of course grade - two midterms and a final). I had a horrible experience during the first midterm exam with ProctorU and it took almost 5 days to hear anything from the course staff. I found the projects (40% of course grade) relatively easy, but they required a good bit of tinkering and took a good bit of time to run the simulations.  Very rewarding. Learning a lot (not yet finished). Projects are good but little tedious and reinforced what we learnt in theory. This is my first class and I think it will act as a solid foundation to any systems class I might take like intro to HPC or Intro to OS or even AOS. I have gone through random lecture of all these classes and found the concepts are highly needed there.  May review may be biased since I am working on processor verification. This lecture gave me more insight and broader perspective. Beginers may find overwhelmed by course load but lot of them are building blocks and are absolut necessary for computer architecture. In my time assignment was average hard. Once you figure out initial thing rest are mostly repetative contact TAs for starting, Exams are open book and question quality is great , But it tend to have only 5 questions if you dont get a part of it whole question you wont be able to answer. Also evaluation of assignment and exam is harsh Very erratic course. The material was very interesting, and I generally liked the presentation. Everything else, though, was awful. Poor responsiveness on Piazza, with a week or more going by without any instructor or TA presence. Absurd grading... one assignment had us submit (among other things) a 'Hello World' program with a modification to include our name. I forgot to submit that one (partly because the way the assignments are written makes it tricky to pull out what's needed for a submission) and got docked 30% of the whole grade. The course makes use of the SESC simulator, which is one of the worst, most poorly documented codebases I've ever seen. In addition, the effort required to work with SESC and modify it was vastly out of proportion to what we were studying. I never understood how wading through SESC to figure out how to change the branch predictor had any relevance to what a real processor does. Finally, the exams were a disaster. They used ProctorTrack for the test, but it was basically open book in that you could use any printed or written references, but couldn't use anything on your computer. You had to do everything by hand on paper (like when doing the incredibly tedious cycle counting problems). This was a real problem in the test, because I hadn't done them that way... I always worked in OneNote to set up my tables, plug in my steps, etc. When I had to do it on paper on my desk, it was a complete mess.  This was a pretty great course. The lectures are well done, and the tests were straightforward. The projects were on the challenging side, but not because the concepts themselves were difficult (though they aren't a cakewalk either... ). The main challenge in the projects is development in a simulator that is old, *very* poorly documented, somewhat nebulous, and doesn't seem to follow a coherent design. That being said, it isn't really a problem, just time consuming. \n\nI took a similar course in undergrad, but this class goes more in-depth into actual algorithms and designs, and peels off several layers of abstraction to get into the core of CPU architecture design and theory. I would definitely recommend it, but do be prepared for the projects! Amazing course! Excellent video lectures. Haven't learnt so much in a long time. Prof. Prvulovic's explanations left very little doubt on almost all the topics he covered in the lectures. I have them all downloaded & can keep going back for reference. Although a more active participation on piazza would have made the learning experience even better. But, having gone to a college here in the US for my masters' I know it's almost not possible to get full attention of a Prof all the time... \nPerhaps some homework assignments would have helped improve the understanding even better (& helped in the midterms :)). The projects were interesting and were useful in applying what we learn in the classes. There were lot of complaints about the SESC simulator code in general. Its very understandable that the code is in that state having changed so many hands. Don't have much to complaint about this course in general. \nOverall experience with the course has been very satisfying. Very disappointing class. Its starts out fine. The lectures are good and the professor is very good at explaining the material, and there's A LOT of material. The exams are hard but decent representations of what was taught. \n\nThe projects on the other hand are poorly done. Any attempt at trying to implement what you've learned in the lectures is overshadowed by very confusing code. For one project students wasted hours and hours trying to work on code that the TA's eventually admitted had an error in it. I didn't learn anything from the projects and they account for almost half the grade. \n\nThe worst part of the class was the presence of the professor and the TA's on Piazza. It was decent at first but halfway through the class suddenly nothing was being addressed. There was literally an entire week leading up to the due date of a project where no questions were addressed, and there were a lot of questions. I'm actually amazed that the TA's in this class got compensated for their efforts. Not only was their presence abysmal, but many students were still posting about month old regrades into the last week of classes. \n\nBottom line: There's a reason this class has the highest withdrawal rate in the program.  This is a very hard class, but in my opinion completely worth it. Don't let fall behind on the lectures or cram everything into a weekend, it will be your downfall. The professor was active for the first half of the semester on Piazza. We had a really great TA that was active in answering questions and clarifying any material we've learned. Please review your C++. It wasn't too bad but having some background on C++ will help you be ahead in the coding projects. Overall I loved the course, even though it was difficult.  For the most part, I really enjoyed this class and the labs. My problems with the labs were twofold. First, the emulator used in this class is poorly documented and has weird behaviors that have to be taken into account to get correct results. Once I understood (read: got burned by) this, I spent more time in the projects trying to make sure that I didn't misunderstand how the emulator worked than I did actually doing the lab. The second part was that it was really hard to get a feel if your lab results were expected. It is structured so that you do the work and analyze the results. I ended up analyzing the \"wrong\" results and got double penalized (see point one). The TAs try to help with this, but they can't just come out and say whats wrong, so make sure that you read everyones notes to the TAs regarding the labs. There may be something there that is relevant to you, even if the post's title doesn't seem that it will be. This class is hard, but you will learn a lot. Hands down, this class has the best lectures of any course I've taken. \n\nThe projects revolve around a simulator whose source code is old, defunct and hacked together by a bunch of academics. On the surface it looks incredibly hard, but you only need to change a few lines here and a few lines there to get it to do what you want. They'll tell you which source files to look at. I found this experience of reading other people's source code helpful, now that I have a job as a maintenance programmer. Use a buddy for the project if groups are still allowed. \n\nThe tests were hard, but not unreasonable. Study and you'll be fine. \n\nWe had an issue with one project spec (the required IPC was not attainable), but the Prof gave us a few day extension.  I was able to manage this course with no professional programming background. But you need to spend a lot of time trying to understand the code in the simulator for the projects. I think this code is basically written by hardware folks trying to get the job done in software, which is effectively what the simulator is simulating, a processor. I think the intention of the instructor is to have students spend time on understanding the code rather than give it to them on a platter with comments. If you nail the project 1, the others are just a breeze. Once you understand the flow, actual implementation should be fairly straightforward. Lectures are just awesome. Mid-term was hard mainly due to lack of time, 2 hours is not sufficient. Final was easy even though it was comprehensive. Solid class.", 
    "CS-6291": " Enjoyable course, we got to look under the hood of compilers and learn about different optimization techniques as they apply to embedded systems.  The projects were time consuming and interesting.  My only complaint is that due to the nature of the projects they took a long time to grade so we didn't know about 75% of our grade until the week of finals.  But everything was graded fairly and carefully with good feedback so all's well that ends well I suppose.  Looks like this is the first review of the course, but it's just because it used to be 8803 - see the one with embedded in the name for some relevant reviews. \n\nI really liked the course, and a lot of it had to do with the main TA's involvement on Piazza. The assignments are pretty straightforward, and the projects are not too bad as long as you get ahead on them and don't wait until the last minute. Exam was meh - ProctorTrack sucks but what else is new. This class was very much a mixed bag. The course material is interesting and the professor understands it well, but the lectures often were a little convoluted and hard to follow. The assignments and projects seemed a little rough; most of them were updated to include clarification/correction after being initially assigned. I believe this is the first time this class has been offered online. After another semester or two, once the kinks are worked out, I could see this being a very good class.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this class was definitely with the first (group) project. It felt like my group spent as much time trying to parse the project description and figure out the project requirements as actually complete the project. On the last weekend before it was due, we probably spent a combined 45-50 man-hours (on a 3-person team) trying to complete it and still didn't finish. I think the instructors realized that the project was more difficult than they anticipated, because they ended up grading it very generously (I received full credit even though the project was incomplete). The second project was also much more reasonable.", 
    "CS-6300": " good introductory class for OMSCS for those who are not familiar with java, eclipse, github or other tools. I had problems because my laptop wouldn't support Android runtimes, but even bombing that project had time and other projects to make up the grade. \nThe grading was a bit frustrating, losing points for having a comment without the correct capitalization. The projects were fun though.  This class might be easier if you already have professional software development experience, but I still learned useful skills and overall enjoyed the course. My group worked well together although based on the discussions this wasn't always the case. You should not take this course if you new to programming or cannot figure out how to use a search engine.  I thought this was a great class. I've been doing professional development for over 20 years and honestly didn't really expect to learn much.... however I did (and a few things I had forgotten from the past got reinforced). I thought the professor's lectures were extremely professional and actually entertaining. Online resources including Piazza, Google Hangouts, and regular office hours from the professor and TAs also helped. I've taken four other graduate courses online at another school and this blew those away in terms of quality of content, interaction with other students and staff, and sophistication of projects requested of us. As an aside, I want to note here that anyone taking this course should invest in learning Java fairly well before diving in. It's a poor excuse to be taking an MS CS course but claim you're unable to do the project work because you're not a programmer. This is CS - it requires coding skills and this course definitely utilizes those skills. Just be glad it's Java and not Lisp or Erlang....  I have a difficult time figuring out who is the ideal audience for this class. The first few weeks cover 'this is what an IDE is' and 'this is what source control is', etc. - stuff you would expect in an undergrad CS101 class. Other topics are very advanced, like 'write a non-trivial database-aware Android app in 2 weeks, including test cases and other stuff'. It seems to me like anyone who was new to the former is going to get completely sunk by the latter, and anyone who is capable of the latter is going to be bored out of their skull by the former and then be surprised by 'oh... we actually have to work in this class!' halfway through. For this reason, I think the class should be split in two, so that people can take only the portion that is relevant to them. I'll echo other commenters' statements about group work - do not like it, and in the future will only look for classes that involve solely individual work.  Hate group work. Hate staying on group schedules while we are all working and in different time zones and schedules. Interesting course work; hope you get a good group. Better if you have a strong backround in java - you do not want to hope your group mates do. If you do, take the lead in coding right from the start - it'll waste too much time to try and make it equal, which people tend to want to do - there's probably only 1 maybe 2 actual coders in your group, and there is a lot of documentation and stuff anyhow.  I would say this class was really easy in the sense that it wasn't super stressful and the projects didn't feel like 'homework'. If you're looking to take multiple classes at once I'd consider doing so alongside SDP. This course is about the best practices in software development. The course is very well organized and provides a great coverage of the full-cycle of the software development from requirement collection to test-driven software development. There is no difficult concept to understand, the challenge of this course is really the follow the schedule and deliver assignment project on a weekly basis. I had no Java and Android development experience before, this course provided an excellent introduction to these two topics. The assignment for testing, i. e., white-box and black-box are really interesting. The instructors did a great job to design the individual assignment, which wraps up the important concepts and techniques of the entire course nicely. To me, the most challenging part of the course is the group project, this is partial due to the time commitment to work together with one free rider in the team. We struggled quite a bit, but in the end managed okay thanks to the generous grade given by the TAs. It would be easier for us to keep track of the course progress if the grades were released a bit earlier though. This a good introductory course for new students, people without programming backgrounds, or those that want to dip their toes in. \n\nLectures and assignments are done very well and although there are some hiccups they are in the realm of what I would expect for a large class (200-400 students) and one taught online. Grading is very fair although one of my complaints in a lot of these lower level classes is that roughly 50% of the class gets 100% on assignments and then there is a steep drop off. You either aced the testing criteria the TA / Professor had in place or you lose 10, 15, 30%. I would rather see an actual bell curve where very few students get 100% even if the majority get 90+. \n\nBesides the group project, all of the programming required is on par with sophomore level programming classes especially if you have any Java experience. For the other assignments such as defining test cases, diagrams, etc. I only found about 20-30% of it actually value added but I appreciate being exposed to these various tools even if at the end of the day I didn't find many of them useful in the real world. \n\nFor the group project, as many others have mentioned, it is very dependent on your teammates. That being said, you can do yourself a big favor by assigning tasks based on individual skills, don't try to break it up \"evenly\" or \"fairly\". If one member of your team writes android applications professionally there is nothing wrong with having that person write the entire app themselves. Another person do all of the diagrams, and another all of the writeup. Run your team like you would an interdisciplinary team at work. \n\nI gave 3 stars as I personally didn't learn much in this class, if you come in to OMSCS with a lot of coding experience its ok to skip this one and take something more challenging or interesting. The lectures are good. For a person coming with a significant background in programming, there may not be nothing new to learn in this course, except for Android programming, if one is not familiar already. Good engagement from professor. Overall, this course was a very good intro to the OMSCS program for me, and provided an overview of software development techniques I had always wanted to learn. The Udacity lectures were informative with easy-to-grasp concepts, and Professor Orso has inspiring enthusiasm for the subject matter. This being my first course I can't compare to other GT classes, but this is easily the best online course I have ever taken. I appreciated the weekly YouTube office hours and was not required to post a mindless forum thread on a weekly basis, in contrast to my undergrad experience. The weekly workload is entirely doable if you read the instructions CAREFULLY and IGNORE your classmates' forum posts until you've absolutely hit a wall and need an answer to something in particular. Using this strategy, even while working 50 hour weeks I devoted about 4 days out of the week to schoolwork (this 1 class) and managed to get no less than a 94% on each assignment, I consider myself a software developer newbie with average intelligence. My favorite part of the course was the group project which we split up equally on documentation and coding, and I could not have asked for a better team. Having said all that, the TAs do take their sweet time on grading assignments, apparently especially if you choose to contest a grade (I did not), and I rarely saw any interaction by other TAs on the forum besides the two heads (perhaps they were grading?). There are some concepts that I would have liked to go deeper on, such as Agile, and the lectures could be updated with lessons on the currently used software. These did not manage to spoil my enjoyment of the course. Very intersting class, and useful to those with little background in Object Oriented Programming. You get exposure to Java, Android, SQL, OO software design. If you already have this kind of background, the class should be a breeze. If not, there will be some catch-up, but it's not such a big deal. The one hickup to this class is that your experience will depend heavily on what group you were placed into, as the second group project was somewhat complicated if you don't have prior Android and SQL experience. The individual assignments are all very straight-forward and not time intensive.  Great introductory class for the OMSCS program. Well structured, with interesting projects, both individual and online. The Professor and TAs were very involved. Even though I has many years of experience in the software development industry, this clas kept me interested and learned a few tricks as well. You will need a bit of Java, nothing too deep.  I think this class was very simple for a CS major or someone with a previous background in the subject. But you should be comfortable with Java or C# before taking the class. I think the class could have had much more material and be more rigorous. Since I have quite a bit of industry experience I don't think I got a whole lot of new knowledge. The assignments were simple the only problem being coordinating with your team. In the end some of the projects (like Project3) just seemed like busy work. I think it is a good class to get you warmed up for the harder classes in the program. The Piazza forum had some interesting discussions going because of the variety of student background in the subject matter. The professor is very responsive in the forums and fun to watch in the lectures.  I did not get much out of this course and didn't enjoy the experience very much. The material explored many topics but none of them in-depth, in some cases were just basic tutorials for tools like git and Eclipse. The assignments felt more like jumping through hoops rather than being challenged to think critically and be creative. Overall the course felt disorganized and vague, most of the time I was not confident that I actually understood what was required and had to read a lot of forum posts for clarification, even on extremely simple busy work assignments. The most effort in the course is required during the group projects, which can include students anywhere on a spectrum from not being able to write code at all to having 10+ years of Java experience. A lot of groups had problems and partially due to that the last group project was changed to a solo project at the last minute. I think I would only recommend this course to beginners who are confident that they can write Java code but do not have much software development experience beyond that. If you know absolutely nothing about concepts like source control, test coverage, and UML then you will learn a lot. If you already have a lot of experience in software development and want to explore software engineering concepts higher than a very basic level, this course is not for you.  This was a tough course for me having never been a software developer and knowing no java. Can be extremely time consuming. Luckily when you get teams to work with you are given teams with skills that compliment your own. I took this course while I was on vacation for most of the term and completed it with an A. \nFor someone with hands-on java programming and software development experience, this course should be a cake walk. Also, taking SAAD(CS 6310: Software Architecture and Design) in my prior semester helped skim through most of the UML/Design pattern related stuff. From a learning perspective, Android app development and testing methodologies were some of the interesting aspects. Group project got a little tricky with one member MIA but the remaining two of us were able to get the project past finish line. Lectures, Piazza and Office hours were well planned/coordinated.  After having many years of industry experience, I felt this course is very basic and assignments/projects were okay not great. Well, If you are just into software industry and trying to learn basics, this may be a good course. I've been a developer/coder for 18yrs; so the concepts that this course taught were nothing new to me.\nI didn't learn anything new; however I would recommend this course as someone's first OMSCS course.\nI've read quite a few bad reviews; and didn't experience anything like what was mentioned. \nThe projects in the course were fairly easy and didn't take me much time; but again, I've been developing for while. Useless class.\n\nAs an experienced developer, I have a lot of problems with this course and completely regret taking it. The professor read a bunch of papers in the early 90s and decided to make a class based on his naive understanding of software development. It is easy to get an A if you follow instructions closely and prioritize what the professor and TAs think is important. \n\nAlso, very much a TAs vs. students environment; I never felt like they were trying to teach us, but instead using us to make their lives easier (even though they still took 8+ weeks to grade a single homework on some occasions). I think this is because there wasn't really anything to teach.\n\nWaste of my time and waste of money. My java skills were entirely not up to snuf. I thought this class would focus on the process and wouldn't require so much ground up coding. I seriously had the best group ever but even that's hard because you don't want to let people down and the coding just required more time than I had to spend. I will try and avoid classes with group projects from now on. In terms of grading, even when I thought my submission sucked, I got a decent grade. Even not knowing enough java, I would have gotten a B on my own but my awesome group assignments pushed me to an A. I hope in the future they reconsider that Android app project as it is just way too much in that short time (maybe extra crappy due to summer?) Know your Java. Android assignment hadn't been done by staff with the version we had to use. It and Git needed more attention. Simultaneous deadlines. Other than that, I feel good about the course, i. e. , the Piazzan esprit de corp, videos (Orso & clever cartooning), challenges, and teamwork. Learned alot, I believe.  Good exposure to a variety of tools. Assignments should be done by staff first to make sure there are not issues. Course grading should have been better defined.  Easy material if you are experienced in developing software but the team projects were a lot of work. What ended up happening is you are paired with people of varying levels of skill and if you are more experienced, you end up doing almost all of the work. If everyone did their equal share, it probably would have been 5-10 hours a week but since that isn't realistic, a lot of weeks I was stuck doing almost all of it which is a good 15-20 hours. Earned an A in the class The content was a bit outdated IMO. Professionally not many places use formal UML modeling anymore and I think there was too much emphasis put on formal documentation to be truely representative of the real world. The individual assignments were okay (not too difficult) but they were looking for a very specific way for them to be implemented which in my opinion were just bad design. The course instructor was one of the most engaging though which made it an alright experience. As others have commented the group work is awful, there is such a huge gap in experience and certain team members carry the lions share of the burden. I understand it's trying to represent 'real-world' work where you have to collaborate with a team, but in the real world you don't have people with so little programming experience who are still gainfully employed, and quite frankly the 'project-manager' role for the project doesn't have an equitable share of the work.  Lectures: good. There are also some interesting resources that Prof. Orso links to in the class schedule. Read those!\n\nAssignments: overall pretty easy, (I have ~3 years experience in the software development industry with Java + CS undergrad degree involved a lot of Java). My biggest complaint is that the grading was all over the place. Some assignments were graded harshly while others seemed to only be glanced at. At least for the Spring 2016 semester it seemed that they didn't have enough TA/graders to handle the number of students. \n\nGroup projects: Project 1 was kind of silly, Project 2 was a good first \"real\" Android app. Groups are teams of four, and your workload will probably depend on your team members. The second project was the most time consuming part of the course. \n\nNo exams. \n\nOverall: If it weren't for the nice introduction to Android I would regret taking this course. It is really meant for students who are new to CS (or at least Java) or have been away from it for a while. \nI took this class with Introduction to Operating Systems. It was a doable double (A in both courses) but I didn't get to do as much \"reading on the side\" as I would have liked. \nThis is the only class I have ever taken (including undergrad) where all Piazza questions were answered.  I am glad that I've taken this as the starting course of OMSCS. Overall, it is a very gentle and basic class to learn Java and software design & testing \n\nVideo & Office Hour: it is short and fun to watch. Prof.Alex is very engaged and TAs are involved with Office Hour and have been on the Piazza all the time. Thumb up to Head of TA and Erin, who are most responsible TAs I've encountered so far in my education.\n\nAssignment &  Project:\n7 Assignment\n1 Group Project and 1 Individual Project\nFirst 3 Assignments teach you to write simple Java program in IDE.\nGroup Project is to step-by-step design and to build an Android App. I think it is a good intro for software development process, including documentation, UML, test plan and even some database skill to prepare the overall structure of the app. But don't worry about you have to do it all by yourself. Highly suggest you get a better computer in order to run the android studio smoothly. It saves your testing time for quite a bit.\nI think the Individual project is a little bit easy and less practical in term software design. Though it covered the course content of black-box testing and refactoring, we didn't get to practice that on a complete software program.(It is a small command line utility)\n\nIf you think you don't have any CS background, you could take this course as the only one and first course. If you have any background in Java or familiar with another programming language, I would suggest you to take this class with another medium or easy class in your first semester or take it in the summer.\n\nEnjoy this class with good discussion and helps from classmates!\n\n\n Like some others have posted, I am not sure how is it that there are students giving 5 stars for this course. I do not necessarily blame the professor, rather, the TA's. These are the worst TA's I have ever had. At this moment, we have been waiting for answers for questions for the assignment due this week (November 8, 2017), and it is 3 days and we haven't received answers. But guess what! Yes, when it comes to grade the assignments do not expect the best results, these TA's are like in the Olympus, untouchable. They use this autograde system that will never grade as a human does. Even if you are not very good developing, their comments or feedback will push down, making you feel like you are not worthy of becoming a developer, or something else, because we have to be honest, this master program isn't to make 'software developers', it is for anybody in the area of computer science: IT engineers, developers, architects, etc. The name of this course sounds interesting, but the content to me is awful. I don't know the reason we have to be doing like more than 50% in software testing if there is already a course called 'Software Analysis and Testing'. \n\nBy the way, get ready to be part of an experiment, when it comes to use this tool called 'TSLGenerator'. There is no valuable information on the internet for this, nor videos, etc. Nothing! The little you can learn you get from the Udacity lectures. So, the only reason I am taking it is because it is one of the options as requirements. The other course is 'Computability, Algorithms, and Complexity', thus, either you take SDP or you take CAC. \n\nThe schedule for assignments due? The worst! They are due every Friday night; Saturday morning for some people. I wonder why they do that, when other courses assignments are due on Sundays. It looks like the people leading this course do not have a sense of humanity. They do not care if you have a family or if you are in another course: assignments are due every week on Friday! Easy class. Take it if you want a free A. This course can be easy if you already have experience as a software developer, but it can be challenging otherwise. Make sure you brush up on Java, Android, Git, and JUnit before taking this course. All of the coding is done in Java, using the IntelliJ and Android IDEs. You should probably take this course early in the program, as the language and tools used in this course will prepare you for other courses in the program. You will be building two Android applications in this course, one by yourself and one with a team. Hopefully you land in a team with at least two knowledgeable software developers, else you will be writing a lot of code on your own. This is a good class. The lectures are fluid and linear, and the projects are really good at providing a platform to try out the techniques taught in lecture. There was an element of Android development which presented a bit of a learning curve to some, but generally if you are comfortable in Java then this course will be easy for you. The workload is definitely back-end; the last few projects are group-based as well.  If you have experience in Java development, this should be a pretty straightforward class. The most difficult part of this course was coordinating with your team for projects 1 and 2. The programming assignments were usually pretty simple and could be knocked out in one sitting. Overall, the course was pretty enjoyable. The lectures were extremely polished and thoughtfully designed.  For me, starting fresh, I thought this was going to be an easy class to get familiar with the program, and I was right. I enjoyed the content very much, which was an advanced rehearsal of the software architecture classes I received in college, and the programming portion wasn't difficult at all. \n\nThere was a lot of documentation to write. You need to be ready for it and feel comfortable creating UML diagrams and writing lots and lots of content. This is tricky because your evaluation will highly depend on what somebody else interprets of your writing. In Software there are usually multiple ways to skin a cat, so you need to make sure to show the instructors that your way is a valid one. \n\nThe course uses Java throughout. If you have used it before, you shouldn't have any problems getting by. The material is not complicated, and I enjoyed the different programming assignments. The final project is the development of an Android application, which will take some time. I did Android before, so I felt right at home, but I saw some people struggling because the learning curve wasn't easy. \n\nDuring the class, you are part of a team that works the projects together. Teams are somehow hit or miss; there's usually somebody that does very little to help during the class. If you are unlucky, you can find yourself bearing most (if not all) of the work. At the end of the project, you get to evaluate each team member, which is appropriate and forces people to try to be helpful. \n\nIn the end, it was an excellent course, and I loved the material. Although I was very familiar with the topic, I had the opportunity to rediscover things that I had long forgotten. The workload stretched me enough, and I highly recommend it for anyone working in the Software industry. Easy but fustrating assignments. Basically a lot of documentation and a few, 3, java projects. TAs kind of dropped the ball in semester.  I enjoyed this course. The professor and TAs were very involved, which was a nice contrast to CS6250. Lectures were interesting, and assignments/projects did a decent job of letting students practice the development process concepts we were learning about. I came in to this class with 6 or 7 years of. NET development experience, but no Java/Android experience. I had to spend a little extra time on the assignments to transition my. NET knowledge over to Java, but it was easy to do so and the assignments are relatively basic. I would think that someone with zero programming experience would want to take a quick intro before jumping in, though. There were two group projects in this iteration of the class, which I'm normally not a fan of but they complemented this class nicely. Good simulation of working as part of a team in the real world. I felt like the way they handled grading the team vs. individual contributions was fair. I had a great group that had no problems working together, so I'm not sure how any serious conflicts within the team would be handled if the professor/TAs had to be involved.  Found it easy but I have 10+years of experience in software development. Course is very organized, teaching team is excellent and touches a lot of tools of the trade. The empahsis on the importance of software testing is biggest take-out for me from the course.  If you do a little prep work in java and SQL this class will be easy. Look into the coursera classes to help you prep. Not a lot of time is required to do well in this course. If you are just getting back to school after a large break this class is a great starting point I definitely recommend this course as an intro to the OMSCS program. The professor is energetic and involved. The assignments were mostly practical and allow for proficiency with a bunch of development tools. Programming is in java, and db experience helped a lot with the group project. Speaking of the group project - I had a wonderful group and really enjoyed the group assignments, however some had a more negative experience. We were not allowed to select our groups so you have to make the best of what you are given. \n\nThe four weaknesses of the course were 1) VERY slow turnaround with grading. 2) The rubrics were not published and some of the grading seemed a bit nit-picky. There was one case in particular where instructions for a deliverable weren't entirely clear, yet grading was strict on that section. 3) I was a bit disappointed with the final project since it wasn't something one would ever encounter in the real-world, and it did not add much to what we had already learned in the class during the semester. 4) The Friday midnight deadlines were rough, especially since office hours weren't until Weds evening. Would have preferred a Saturday midnight deadline so that some of the weekend could be used to finish things up after office hours. \n\nBottom line is that you will leave this course with a good understanding of the pros and cons of different development approaches. You will have completed some interesting white and black box testing assignments, and you will get a good start on Android development if you have never dabbled in that before. The professor and TAs are genuinely supportive. This is a relatively low-stress way to get back into an academic environment after being out of the classroom for many years. For the bad:\nThis is the easiest course I've taken thus far, and it's my fourth software engineering course (2nd at GA Tech), and I have a substantial amount of experience coding in Java which helped. However, this will probably be my lowest grade at GA Tech, because their grading rubric and assignment weights are absolutely asinine. They would deduct huge amounts of points for trivial, ridiculous, or even subjective reasons. \n\nThey would also derive requirements from posts between students, or from optional office hours (note: there was a special requirements interview office hours, and I'm not referring to that one) and then grade against those arbitrary requirements, which I found to be rather uncalled for and unbelievable. \n\nThere's a lot of group work, and every week some project or assignment will be due, so the workload is very consistent, you will be putting in hours towards this class every single week for the full semester. Take this into account if you have a lot of business trips or plan to take any additional courses while taking this one. \n\nFor the good:\nThe lecture videos are some of the best I've seen at GA Tech and the android application development was really fun, plus there were consistent office hours on google hangouts every week.  Reiterating an earlier comment: 'I have a difficult time figuring out who is the ideal audience for this class... ' I couldn't agree more. Lectures were average, but I admire Prof Orzo's enthusiasm. Group projects were terrible - if possible I will never take a group project class in this program again. Students should have to pass some coding pre-reqs to take this course because unprepared students are a huge burden on teammates; 'just' working on documents is no panacea because if they aren't involved with or don't understand the difficulty of implementing requirements, it hurts the entire team. There is zero involvement from TAs in managing group conflict, and no real authority structure to groups. We had a team member who refused to do any coding but argued for adding *more* features than the assignment required. I don't need that kind of drama.  Lecture material is very simple and easy to understand. If you have any industry experience in software development, the concepts should be very familar. Group projects are where the fun is at. Projects require you to develop some software apps (all in Java, two commandline, one Android and one web). You might get paired with people in different time zones so cooperating might get difficult. We had two people drop out of our group which made things stressful. But very quickly you learn to assess each other's abilities and split up the work so everything gets done. I had prior experience in Java but no Android experience and I was able to pick up Android pretty quickly and be productive. I really enjoy programming projects so I really enjoyed this class. Best class I have taken so far (As of writing, I have taken four courses total) I agree with the views regarding the group project. I think that some students were not qualified to take this class and caused an uneven distribution of workload. The other problem was that with a rate of drop out around 20%, the teams that were formed early on in the semester were subject to change. For us, the guy with the Android experience and skills dropped out of the progam and this made it difficult for us to work on the team project. The professor is enthusiastic and the material like testing, GIT, etc. is very relevant so someone new to all this will find it helpful, but those who already use and do such things for work may get bored.  Material and leactures are great. Very helpful. The group projects (if you have a good group) are fun and you learn a lot. I do felt like I spent more time learning about the frameworks and less on the formal process, however learning frameworks is part of the overall process :) Great class for the OMSCS program, well organized and the Professor and TAs are very involved. I already had some years of experience in software development and I still gained a good amount of knowledge. This class will give you the foundation so you can go deeper into software development processes so don't expect to be able to run a team of develpers, planners, testers, etc. just by taking this class. I say this because some people complained about the content of the class. If you don't have prior experience with software development and Java programming, you may need to spend a lot more time. Also, there was an Android project which I think it wasn't too bad but some people complianed about the need to learn a lot of things in a short period of time. The workload will increase towards the middle of the class since you may have individual assingments due while you are still working on a group project. Overall, I think this was a very enjoyable course.  Basically an \"intro to industry\" course. This course is a broad survey of topics relating to how the real world does software development. Includes a group and individual project. The group project can be either very easy or very hard depending on your group - in my case, it wound up being incredibly time consuming (>40 hours one week because I had two absentee group members). I wouldn't recommend taking this course in the summer for just that reason - I don't think they scale the project back for the accelerated schedule, and one bad week of coordination can tank your schedule. \n\nThe lectures are informative and well-done. The professor and TAs are very involved with the class, and I'd take another course from Orso in a heartbeat. \n\nIf it's been a while since you've worked as a software engineer in a modern environment, this is a great course. If you're like me, and have been one for more than half a decade, it's probably less valuable. This was a good course that covered a wide variety of software development processes and topics. It should be a good primer for the other software development courses. The lectures were well thought out and the presentation was good. The individual assignments can usually be completed in a couple hours (2-4). The group projects can take upwards of 20-25 hours a week. The class originally had 3 group projects, but 1 was changed to an individual assignment by the professor due to various group issues. This course requires Java programming so learn it beforehand or be prepared to learn on the fly (which is what I had to do). You will also need to know some SQL and Android. If you're already skilled in another OO language it shouldn't be too difficult to pickup these skills as you go along.  Good class. They've changed the structure from previous summer's. We had both an individual and a group project. I think the change really made the class a bit too hectic on weeks we had assignments and individual deliverables in the same week. Also, the TA's weren't able to keep up returning grades and feedback in time for projects that were dependent on prior assignments. I still really liked the class but expected with the class being offered every term since our program was started to be well oiled machine by this iteration. DISCLAIMERS:\nThis was my first course in the program, so I spent a fair amount of time early in the semester learning basic OMSCS infrastructure (Udacity, Piazza, T-Square, slack). Related, although I have experience as a software engineer, my current job is entirely different. So I also spent a good chuck of time creating a workable setup on my machine (Cygwin, .bashrc aliases, git). Finally, although Java is clearly stated as a prerequisite, my closest experience is C++ from 15 years ago. So coming up to speed there was nontrivial.\n\nPROS:\nProfessor Orso is a ton of fun! The lectures are great and the office hours are helpful. I enjoyed the material and appreciated the weekly assignment cadence. This course has been refined over many iterations, and the instructors are very clear that the decision to make each assignment due on Saturday morning is a deliberate one. Initially I was unhappy about this, but came to rather enjoy it by using some weekend time to get ahead on the homework rather than scrambling to meet the deadline. We were exposed to several technologies and tools (git, IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, Java, JUnit, markdown, XML). The Android Studio group project was a lot of fun. Groups were assigned based on mutually available meeting times and complementary Java experience, which worked out great! \n\nCONS:\nAssignment grades were consistently very late. I literally had no idea how I was doing in the course for the first half of the semester. (As a new student, this was particularly unsettling!) The instructors take grading very seriously, and go to lengths to ensure fairness by making sure grade distribution from TA to TA isn't skewed, releasing all grades simultaneously, and so on. I do prefer a fair grade over a fast grade, so I appreciated this. However, I think it's also reasonable to expect timely qualitative feedback, perhaps with a delayed quantitative grade. (Otherwise, there's no difference between OMSCS and watching Lynda videos!) I felt the lack of timely feedback hampered my learning and caused unnecessary anxiety. Professor Orso is amazing - his lectures are fun, engaging, clear, concise. He's also all over piazza, which is very encouraging for the students. \nAs for the content - to be honest, I wish there was more content. And assignment material to practice it on. I committed less than 10 hours a week to this class, and covered the materials and tasks easily. I would've gladly committed another 5 to cover more content - maybe delve a bit deeper into design concepts, or perhaps an extra individual project with android. The instructors are not available to answer questions. They claim that they cannot guarantee a response in 24-48 hours. The course is more about following the process. There are assignments every week, which kind of make it hard. For me, with a baby arriving in September and full time job, the weekly assignments made my life a hell. I was constantly chasing a target. The assignments are very ambiguous and requires the help of other students to understand what is asked. Assignments submitted are not graded even after 2 months of submission. In all, I would say avoid this subject if possible. There are many other good subjects and good TAs around there. This course was very simple. It introduces you to the basics of Software Development and provides some tools that you would use on a daily basis. Many of the projects and assignments were very simple and took around 3-4 hours per week to finish. The TAs and Professors were very good and helpful. \n\nOverall, an easy first class but none of the material will be new to someone who has worked in the field for a few years.  Agree with most everyone above me. I thought this was a very easy intro class for Graduate level. The most time intensive part of the class was regarding to meeting with my teammates fro group projects. I luckily had a wonderful group and everyone did their part on the projects. The difficulty level on projects and assignments were quite easy, especially if you watch the lectures. There was only one issue with an assignment due to semantics but was graded fairly by the professor. This class is more focused on the documentation more than the actual programming itself. The latter part I found quite trivial and this was without any java experience. Pretty much if you watch the videos you should get enough knowledge on how to do the assignments and it should be a pretty easy A.  Not too much to add, it was the first class I took in the OMSCS and I was bored. I did get some good info design strategies. This could definitely be a 2nd course for a 2 course semester If you are new to java, do not take this class.  Know java and know SQL. Learning android on the fly definitely a requirment and will make your group members very happy I liked the lectures and have found the content very relevant. The assignments and projects are straightforward. For the projects, I think a lot depends on the group you are assigned to. I had a great group, so even though we lost one member that dropped the course after groups were assigned we were all active and involved in sharing the workload and it turned out okay.  My first class in OMSCS so it is hard to judge Overall Difficulty. I have a lot of software programming background but very little Java. Some kind of assignment or project deliverable is due practically every week. Only one class project was particularly challenging... but luckily some of the other team members had some strong Java and database experience so they definitely carried the day. Generally good concepts and the assignments/projects helped reinforce the lectures.  Great course on the general development process. I enjoyed the projects, as I had a pretty awesome team, and the individual assignments. \n\nVideos are very, very well done. Dr. Orso was excellent in helping and staying in touch on Piazza. He also worked very well to keep the course moving and fixing issues.  I loved this class, luckily I had an amazing team. It was fun to create Android application as well. Knowing Java is very important. Facilitating with remote classmates are challenging at times, but with the right communication tools I think it is not too difficult.  This class is very useful. It's somewhat easy if you already have some software development experience. The teamwork was a challenge because some team members aren't as dedicated plus dealing with schedules was a pain If anything, take this class if you like your lectures spoken with a cool Euro accent. \n\nI think the grading was generous. As long as you read the assignments very carefully, you should get > 95% on all assignments. I read on the forum, though, that many complained about getting major points off, but that's their own fault for not following directions. \nWhat else... forums are very active. If you ask a question, you'll get many answers within an hour or so. \n\nThe Lead TA's are awesome!  They provided really good feedback in Piazza, and at least one TA used to answer questions in the Slack channel.\n\nAs much as I loved this course, the only I didn't like were the Friday deadlines. I was calling in sick every Friday to finish my assignments, until my boss pulled me into a breakout room to have a 1-on-1. He thought I wanted 3-day weekends every week. lol. \n\nIn summary, take the course if you want to learn Android, or if you want to learn techniques on how to write quality code. This class had very active TAs and instructor, which was great. It never goes super-deep into some of the topics, but is a good general course on software development. I had a pretty good group for the group project, with only one member not contributing much, so things went well and we received a good grade. I would recommend this class if you haven't done much software development. I've done it off and on for 20 years and I found the topics to be pretty easy, but enjoyable. In three words: tedious and tiresome. The material is not difficult at all. I actually enjoyed the lecture videos. However, the mind numbing, useless and extremely tedious assignments and projects makes this course almost unbearable. If that wasn't enough, your assignments are all due at 8 am on Saturday. Therefore, you can almost guarantee that this class will ruin every Friday the entire semester. \n\nThe assignments are intended to help you master a certain topic, however most of them are extremely unnecessary, vague and time consuming. I've never wondered in the desert before but I\"m pretty sure this is what it feels like. Constantly wondering how you got into this situation, if you will ever see an end to the drought, wondering if you're just walking in circles and elation when you're finally done. \n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this class. Very Good software development foundation course, taught passionately by Dr. Orso and TA Team. Office Hours were conducted diligently and all clarification questions were addressed nicely. Very good Piazza Participation. Only downside was having team project and individual assignments going on in parallel during the summer time, making it very tight. The fall and spring semesters may not encounter this issue. Good intro course to software development, Android and JUnit testing. The group project and Individual project were interesting, but focus on testing is a lot in individual project.  I learnt Java and Android development while doing the course so anyone with good software background will find the course easy. The bad part is all the submissions have Friday deadline, which makes it  a very stressful week especially if you are working. Overall a very well structured class. The professor and TAs are awesome in this class and very active so definitely use that resource. The course was mostly review for me, but it is definitely a good intro for people with a light programming background. Some Java experience is recommended. While this class is very broad in covering content and the lecture videos were excellent, the assignments were almost always monotonous and there were huge logistics issues. The assignments were almost always returned about a month later so it took forever to know how well you were doing, the group project (at least in my case) had 4 students in 3 different continents and it was hard collaborating discussions as the meetings for me were always either 1 am or 9 am (not sure if this was just bad luck for me.. or?). The projects themselves were quite interesting but I thought some topics were rushed too much while others had too much time spent on focusing a minute detail that doesn't really matter in the software engineering world.\n\nOverall, the course content was pretty decent and a great learning experience, but the logistics of the class itself has turned me away from the class.  The major programming assignments were group-based. So your experience in this course depends to a large extent on the group you were placed in. I had a great experience with my group however I am aware that this was not the case universally. GATech make an effort to place at least one experienced Java dev in each group so even if you are not particularly strong in programming, you can fill another role in the group such as testing and/or documentation. There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects. The overall progression of the assignments simulated a typical system development lifecycle project (with a RAD twist) with all the associated deliverables; systems requirements doc, prototype, test case doc, UML model, user manual, etc. I found that it was possible to deliver the assignments without really watching the lectures however part of your grade is based on your completion of the udacity quizzes so I guess this encourages you to watch all the lectures. This is a great course to ease yourself into the OMSCS program.  I took this over the summer. The projects are team-based, and I ended up doing a huge amount of work. The content felt dated and too OO focused. The instructor is awesome, but the course is meh.  Wonderful instructor, great class dynamic. My team worked well together, and we were able to parcel out tasks and time to meet, so we didn't have as many issues as other teams did. Projects are very straightforward, and if you're comfortable with Java, you should do well. My only difficulty was learning the hooks for the Android project, as I'd never done that before.  Prof Orzo is very cool. There is a decent chunk of work to do most weeks, (especially if you plan to take over the summer). I am generally not a fan of group assignments, but I was lucky enough to be assigned to an awesome group. Even still, there was overhead in scheduling meetings and whatknot. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this course and think it is a doable amount of work for a summer semester. P. S. A couple of students had issues with the way that 'extra credit' items we rolled into the final grade (somewhat ironic since the final assignment was a 'Student Grader'). As such, I would recommend doing 'extra credit' tasks whenever possible as many of them were pretty straightforward.  This class was AWESOME. Made me a better programer. Alex Orso is a really good teacher that knows how to make an interesting video lecture. Class wasn't to difficult and I liked learning how to make android apps.  Great class! You learn a lot of industry best practices, and a lot of useful tools like java, git, android, and project management. Assignments usually took around 8 hours, except for group projects, which could run around 15 hours. Lectures are clear and concise.  With a good group around me, I found the Android project really edifying about Android, but not really about software development as a process. You write a lot of docs, code the project, then backfill your docs with what really happened. You create one really useful diagram that makes you think, and a ton of expository writing that just fills pages. So, a lot like any highly regulated domain. This presumably forms the core of the class. \n\nHowever, in summer, you get the thrill of concurrent group and individual assignments. The individual assignments contain a lot of \"aha!\" moments that can take hours or days to find. But you don't have hours or days - you spent those on Android. I bet these individual assignments carry meaning in a longer term. In summer, they stand in the way. The course lectures don't have the information or the presentation quality to pull off \"aha\" assignments. Most of what you need, you find googling. And you don't share what you find because you never know how close you walk the line of distributing unfair information. \n\nI would have felt much happier ignoring the lectures and spending that time on the individual assignments. Really, they do not help. \n\nLast point (completely serious): The instructors do not believe in the western tradition of starting things on Monday. They live in an alternate calendar. Get ready to fight it out with your bosses and spouses. This course has no respect for your school/work/life balance, and throws many obstacles in your way. Much harder courses strike the balance, why can't this? If you've already worked as a software developer you should avoid this course. It's some very simple development ideas and introduction to git and android. A team project makes a simple app. \n\nOr take it along with a tough course to pad your schedule.  I think if you already have considerable experience in software developing, this class would both be easy and useless for you. The class covers a wide range of content but doesn't go enough in depth with any of them. The weekly programming assignments also seem to lag the readings a bit (you'll be doing an assignment in Lesson 6 when the reading schedule indicates Lesson 7 or 8). \n\nI don't even consider myself an experienced software developer and there was only a few things I got out of this class that I felt I could apply in the real world. I didn't get enough hands on experience with Android development to be confident enough to enter that field. I got SOME useful experience with black and white box testing which I liked. Other than that I got some Java experience and that's about it. There's an opportunity to get a little bit of project management experience if you volunteer to be the leader for the group project but the curriculum doesn't go into software project management. I do wish the group project was shaped to focus on a particular software development strategy (e.g Agile, Waterfall, etc). I also wish there was a project on refactoring as the lesson material covered that but the projects didn't. This class really measures your writing and Java programming skills. If you don't have experience with Java and JUnit, this class will be very time consuming. The material is not difficult, but project are a challenge (especially if you're placed on a team with weak Java skills). The written documentation you need to write is extensive, but not challenging.  #### Background\nI have Java (10+ years) and Android experience( 2+ years), so the review might be a little biased.\n\n### Course Content\nVideos were a bit too long and if you have been developing software development in any capacity following a lifecycle, should be really simple. \n\n### Udacity Quizzes\nThe udacity quizzes can be taken as many times as required with no penalty, but make sure your last submission is correct as they are counted against the grade.\n\n### Assignments\nThe assignments attempt to build on top of each other with the second half being a group project. Be brutally honest about your skillsets to be matched correctly. There were few teams who had lot of trouble leading to disparaging discussions in Piazza.\n\nIf you have Junits and/or Java development experience, the assignments itself should be a breeze. The only problem would be a black-box testing assignment with no clue about what bugs you are looking for. I would recommend living with whatever is possible as at the end of the day, it accounts only for a small part of your final grade.\n\nIn the group project, attempt to identify an integration lead, ideally with Android experience. It would make all team mates lives simpler with each building one or more components and the lead integrating them together.\n\nI was the lead and all my other team mates either had paired this with other courses or were either getting a baby or moving, so getting the right team and responsibilities is crucial. There are 3 deliverables as a group and getting the dynamics is important to get them delivered.\n\n### Exams/Tests\nThere are no exams and all grading is done via Assignments\n\n### Office hours\nThis is the only 1 course out of the 3 that i have taken where the professor actually does a live office hours.\n\n### Parting words\nIf you have Java experience, this is a simple no-brainer class which can be clubbed together with another course. If you have no Java experience or haven't worked in a group, i would tread a bit light and look for an alternative if possible. The learnings are not that really extraordinary nor the effort worth the merit. This course taught me a great deal about testing and team dynamics. I suspect a lot of your experience depends on the group. My first group worked very well together. The second group (for 3 projects) had lots of late night meetings that moved slowly. (30 hours per week worth) A big part seemed to be busy paperwork but maybe that was just the group I was in. It is very Java oriented and the Android emulator was brutally slow on my machine which made that section tough to deal with.  The professor was very involved. The TAs (who do the grading) sometimes do not follow the \ngrading rubric, so we had to request a few regrades. I did learn alot about Android \nProgramming, GIT, and JUnit. This was more easier than 6310 Software Architecture and Design.  This was a great course. Very informative. Work was doable but the last Project would require some extensive understanding for Java Programming.  Excellent engaging hands-on prof. TAs were well organized with an excellent synchronization of 'one-voice'. Even if you're an experienced programmer, you'll learn quite a bit in this course.  6 Individual Assignments, 3 Group Projects. Easy if you are a java programmer, but a nice easy intro to Android, which I haven't kept up with. Test driven development, other development processes. Work is doable but constant, so take when you won't miss weeks and have time to coordinate with a group. The lecture videos were very well presented and were professionally produced. The professor and TAs were active online and responsive to student questions. These aspects should serve as the gold standard for the class materials and instructor involvement in all OMSCS class offerings. \n\nMuch of the class will be a review if you have worked in the software development industry, but it never hurts to review and there's always a thing or two left to learn. The projects were sufficiently entertaining and educational. Some prior OO and GUI programming experience will go a long way to eliminating any frustrations with this class. \n\nThe group project experience depends largely on the project partners who are assigned to you. I worked with excellent individuals, and the 4 of us just automagically dove into our imagined roles and pounded out a project with a good score. Though there is a mechanism to adjust scoring should there be inequities in contribution from the other group partners (or so I've heard). \n\nBased on conversations with others, there were additional projects that are now in place where they weren't present previously in prior summer semesters. The final projects (both group & individual) were running somewhat in parallel and can make things busy. Group projects tend to increase workload that is otherwise pretty manageable. Not a lot of depth here since the course covers a lot. It's well-designed though and has a lot of activity on Piazza.  This was one of the two courses I took my first semester in OMSCS. I come from a non-CS background and do not code for a living (Im actually in recruiting - ie.. sales). I have never written Java, never been exposed to unit testing, heard of UML but never messed with it. I do have a lot of procedural based coding experience, as well as have developed a CRM using MySql back end in VBA. I have done some PhP/MySql too, but not much. \n\nI couldn't recommend a course more highly, especially for a new student in the program. Dr. Orso was a joy in class, was involved weekly, always available, active on Piazza, and the weekly office hours were fantastic. More importantly for me, the projects made me think. I always (once released) said - oh, this wont take long. Once I got into it - I realized that the assignments were a little more involved and thought provoking than I first thought. The only assignment that I really wish were reviewed was the Category-Partition testing assignment. We had lectures on the subject, we used the application; however, I totally see the value in the tool, but not sure I really understand the best way to choose and assign categories and parameters. \n\nAs for the group Android project, I hit the mother-load with group members! All 4 of us put in a ton of effort on the project, and our grade reflected the work we did. We started early on the assignments, followed the instructions, completed the writing / required documentation, and by meeting multiple times during the week all assignments were submitted and complied with requirements. \n\nIf I had one recommendation, to me, the group project (15% weigh) should have been weighted higher. I certainly worked much more on that than I did on the individual project (which had 20% weight), it consumed more weeks in the course, and was a much more comprehensive effort than the individual project. \n\nTA's were Great and active daily. This class totally flipped how I approach software development! new to CS area from EE hardware field, gained knowledge, practices and confidence by doing those projects and assignments. Even as a person who did not come from a computer science background prior to entering OMSCS, I barely learned anything from this course. It should be said that Professor Orso is excellent, and the lectures themselves are reasonably good. However, the assignments and especially the time it took to have them returned left a huge amount to be desired. Okays class. Group projects are fun. You get to work and deliver projects with your classmates. Prior knowledge of Java is helpful.  I spent many hours in this class compared to others because I don't have that much experience in Java, Android, or databases. I think I came out alright and learned a lot in the end. Group work is a little frustrating since everyone on my team was on a different time zone, but we made it work. I am most appreciative to be in a hard working and cooperative group. The professor and TAs were fantastic and very engaging throughout the lectures, piazza discussions, and office hours. I recommend everyone to take this class.  Was a great way to be re-integrated into the CS curriculum. I've been out of the classroom setting for some time now and this class was simple enough, yet technical enough, to provide me with an opportunity to slowly get adjusted. The content was not too difficult however I do feel as if I learned. \n\nWould have loved more resources to be identified to assist with self-study considering most of the class was just that. Not too hard of a course if you have Java experience. The group project is in the middle, making it an ideal course to pair with another course that has a heavy work load toward the end of the semester. The topics are well covered and easy to grasp, but there are a couple projects that are grind it out, type that make the class less enjoyable. Alex Orso is an excellent professor. This is a great beginner software course, and I really enjoyed the lectures. There was a final group project at the end in Android that was very time consuming, but other than that the assignments were straightforward for people who know Java. I had a horrible time with this class. Everything was subjective to the TA's and the group project was unbearable (I had a really bad group). If you have any real world experience, this class is a waste of your time. I did not learn ANYTHING new from this class. Everything is \"Perfect World Scenario\" with no explanation of how it really works in implementation. I understand that this is a class teaching about the theory of software development, but does not give a real outlook of how it works in industry. Group projects are NOT GOOD! Only a couple of team members have to work on all projects and it affects the final grade.. make sure to do all assignments on time and learn Java/Android before you start this class Very good class to learn materials. Easy to understand. Time consuming with projects and team works. Get heavier end of semester.  Third class I've taken, and I absolutely do not understand the positive reviews for this class. If you have programmed in an OO language before, this class is a huge waste of your time. Several of the projects are tedious and are of limited value to programming In Real Life. \n\nExample: In one project the assignment asks you to write 30 black-box test cases for \"test-driven development\" - when you have the source code (that you wrote) right in front of you. Actual worthwhile tests that you might write in industry are frowned upon. The standard \"red-green-refactor\" is barely mentioned in one lecture, and never really asked for in any assignment. \n\nGrading is unbelievably slow. Assignment feedback (when you get it) is random and worthless. If you want an easy foundational class, go for it. If you want to learn something useful, avoid. This class made me seriously consider dropping out of the OMSCS program. \n\nI should say something positive. If you've never written an Android app, you'll get that opportunity. The group project is also somewhat enjoyable if you find yourself in a good group (which I did). This is a good introductory course. You will get familiar with Java and create an Android application from designing it to actually coding it and testing it. It is important to have a good group and they try to pair the groups so that each team has someone with prior development experience.  I really enjoyed my time with this class. Professor Orso was a very strong teacher and his passion for the subject definitely bled through his lectures and office hours. I would advise that there is a TON of \"ticky-tacky\" grading in certain assignments especially where instructions are incredibly vague or opaque. I struggled not because the material was difficult but because assignments were never entirely clear or the lectures didn't adequately prepare for assignments so you're left researching stack overflow and other places for hours. The projects depending on Android development was a blast! It was cool to see Orso start us off on a mobile project and then implement some of the SDP concepts on the project. Also, you're gonna need a good team for the project. By good I'm not talking about dev-savvy (though it helps). Good in this context means good communicators and overall team members. I had a fantastic team where we could depending on each other and split work appropriately. At the end of the day though, I have a tad bit of a bitter taste in my mouth because of a few assignments and some grading that I didn't agree with 100% (and I'm not the complaining type for this stuff). If Orso and his crew were to re-work some assignments this would be a 5/5 course for me. As it stands it's somewhere between a 3-4/5 Simply the waste of time. Avoid it if you can. I mainly took it to pair with a hard class, but apparently there are other better-use-of-time classes for that.\nWorst part is the head TA. She is a I-know-it-all and not very helpful. TAs enforce an environment on Piazza where students can't help others. I felt bad for some students who genuinely put in all the effort but got stuck in some trivial parts of assignments. But TAs would never give a simple straight answer. It would rather be circular and useless. \n\nOh, and grading is super slow and frustrating. I didn't know more than 55% of my grade till last week of semester.  This was my first class in the program and I thought it was quite well done. The class eases students into development the first few weeks by giving several introductory individual assignments at the beginning including a review of github, Java and Java testing. These will be a breeze for anyone who works as a software engineer already, but gives a nice review and catch up time to those who aren't. Thus, if you aren't a software developer you have a few weeks to ramp up. The group project was perhaps the most time consuming part of the class and also my lowest grade in the class. Overall, the group assignment was not so difficult technically, but the struggle of my group was procrastination by 2 members such that I didn't have time to review and fix what they worked on. The white box/black box testing assignments near the end of the term were interesting, though highly academic and theoretical. Overall, this is a great first class for the OMSCS program, especially if you are already a software developer. The class will also keep you on track with set deadlines and assignments coming out at manageable intervals.  If you are starting OMSCS program without having good programing skills, I recommend taking this class as the class is nicely designed to cover fundamental elements of software development and you will have opportunities to develop or brush up programing skills through the course. While I had been away from programing for quite some years, I was able to catch up and enjoyed all the material in the class. However, I still recommend some preparation beforehand such as learning basics of git commands and java program through the free Udacity courses if you are very new to the program. \n\nThe quality of the class is very good as lectures are well structured and clear. I hear different opinions around project assignments but the class will try to assign a project team with good mix of experience (i. e. balanced) with common available time slots as much as possible. My experience on project was very positive and I felt like I was really in school having a weekly hangout meeting with colleagues. \n\nOpportunity for improvement I felt was the lead time for assignment grades and opportunities to practice white box and black box testings. The class gives some good examples but it would have been nice to go deeper in these area. \n\nOverall, very good class to take and I enjoyed almost all assignments and exercise in this class.  Take this course if you don't have software industry experience. Otherwise, you will learn so little. \nThe course is very well organized and run. Staff are very interactive. Group projects could be a bit of a headache. Be prepared to do the most tedious/hated part of working in the software industry, documentation. Know your Java. And if you want to be the programmer in the group project, know Android dev. Overall, this was an enjoyable course. The content is a good intro for someone like me with no professional CS experience. Most of the assignments were fun, interesting, and not overwhelmingly challenging. I wasn't crazy about the group projects because there's always a roll of the dice with the quality of your teammates, but it mostly worked out ok. \n\nThere is one major problem with the class, though: they were extremely ineffective and providing timely feedback for assignments. We had weekly assignments and in many cases it was over a month between submission and when the grades were released. This made the assignments quite a bit less effective than they could have been. Every week the head TA made commitments about when we'd get our next wave of grades back and he virtually never followed through on those commitments. Were it not for this significant shortcoming, I'd say the class was outstanding.  I enjoyed this course. Although some of the grading felt nitpicky, I think for the most part the instructors were fair. My understanding is group projects could be a crap shoot. Lucky for me my group was terrific and everyone was well-engaged and willing to put forth effort towards each project. This year, two of the projects were group projects with the final agile project being an individual project. \n\nWhile it's not a make or break, coming into the class with an intermediate level of Java is probably best.  This is a very good course for JAVA or Android starter. This is a good course for the introduction of software engineering. It may not be useful for those who have much experience from industry. This course is of medium difficulty. For someone having java/web development experience, this course would not hold any value.\nI am a mainframe programmer from a decade and hardly had any experience with java coding experience, so i learned few basics about java coding and also android development. The lectures were good, but did not taught me anything new as i am already used to work in agile environment. \n\nGrades are always late and no one knows for what marks will be deducted. I lost few marks in some assignments because of fat-fingering few spellings. one of the more interesting classes, it required weekly assignments which were due saturday morning and released on saturday. the work was doable, but it was challenging. This class was awesome! Its not terribly difficult, but you get exposed to many current ideas in software development; you also get exposed to Android programming which is cool as well!\n\nThe instructor is probably the best you will see at GA Tech - he is knowledgeable, passionate about his profession, loves to teach / great at teaching, and is fair. The projects do take some time but as long as you are willing to put the time in, you will have no problems. \n\nTake this course! This course is a great intro to the OMSCS in general. It includes group projects to get you used to coding with a remote team, but at the same time will teach you the basics like using git. For most people who work in SW Development, the content won't be anything new, but the chance to create something in a group is always beneficial. Difficulty and workload definitely depends on the teams. My team was awesome and we were able to accomplish a lot together. I was in charge of main development. Workload will be more during project weeks. Great class to get started.  Despite not having any recent java experience, I found the class very easy. The various assignments vary and some of them you get multiple weeks to work on. The thing that is time consuming is coordinating with your group. There were 2 group projects this semester and testing/documentation are part of the projects, not just coding. If your team works togethter, you don't have to spend a lot of time on the project. I know other comments have mentioned the database aware app, but you get 5 weeks total to work on it between your team members. Our team finished in 4 weeks and didn't actually need the last week but I know some people did.  My assesment may e a little biased in terms of difficulty becasue I hadn't ever programmed with an object oriented package. Also, my background is in EE and not computer science. Regardless, I'd say this class is very well structured to let the student understand the software development process. I was lucky and was assigned an amazing team of individuals that pulled together to get everything done. I know of others that were complaining about their teamamates. In any case, I believe that just reflects real life anyway. I highly recommend this class. Ended up getting an A in the class.  I really liked this class. Some weeks were very easy, and others had tons of work to the point where I spent my whole weekend coding. I suspect if you are good in Java this will help out tremendously. One of the most important variables is that you get placed into a good group since several of the projects are group based. For example our group worked very well, but many others complained in the forums about issues they were having where some team members were dead weight. Because of this your experience can vary greatly. You definetly need to know some Java going into this class. My knowledge was limmited to one class I took several years back, but was able to catch up quick by taking other online tutorials and READING BOOKs as I went and I Googled ALOT! The last project (originally scheduled to be a group project but changed after complaints about groups) was a solo project and very large. My project ended up being over 500 lines of code. It was a good challenging project and I am a better Java programmer for it. Also learning Android development for the first time was fun! The class is interesting but it all depends on your group. We had a terrible teammate for the first few weeks and that was a mess. But, the class ended up fine. This class is an excellent overview of the stated topic. I work at a large company in a division that develops software, and learned much about what certain processes are, why we do things a particular way, alternatives that could be explored and areas that could be improved. The actual coding of the class project was beyond my technical capabilities without a lot of additional work, but fortunately some of my teammates were well versed in programming Java and Android, and I was able to pick up more/most of the work on the requirements and documentation side to make up for it, which obviously helped and felt like a fair distribution. You will need some basic Java programming on your own as well, but if you have any kind of a programming background and take any beginners-level course, like the one offered by Udacity, you'll be fine. The instructors is fantastic and funny, and the TA's are very helpful and responsive. We went nuts with Piazza, which made it hard to keep up with, but that was our fault. Overall I highly recommend this class, even though it's not a killer I think everyone who doesn't have a highly detailed background in large-scale software development and management can benefit from it. If you're a programmer and you want to brush up on the best practices in development, this course is for you. I had long forgotten about best practices and processes. A good course to be reminded of them. The TAs and Prof are very active on Piazza. \nI took it in the summer so there was one assignment every week, which can be a little frustrating. \nThe team projects needs collaboration. I had an awesome team. The tip, respect other people's opinion, its ok to give in sometimes and keep it simple... and do not take anything personal.. its all about the grade. \nThere is one individual project.. follow up on piazza to get through it.. I got it working due to posts on piazza.. \n\nGood luck. This is a good, fairly well-paced course. This course teaches a lot of the fundamental software development processes and techniques that you need to know in the real world but that aren't necessarily taught in undergrad or other grad classes. I would definitely recommend it as the first course you take in OMSCS and also strongly recommend it if you haven't worked as a professional software developer but are looking to break into the field in the future. \n\nI have been a professional software developer for 10 years so I wasn't sure how much I would get out of the class however I did learn some new tricks and techniques in it so I think it is worth it even for people who have done software development in the \"real world. \" \n\nThe class strikes a good balance between learning new subjects in the lectures and testing that knowledge by doing fairly simple programming assignments. The class is paced well and I didn't feel overburdened except for a couple weeks where we had invidividual and group assignments in the same week. \n\nThe group project, like all group projects, is hit and miss depending on the group members you are assigned. If you have someone not pulling their weight it can be a nuisance. That said the grading in general is fairly generous as long as you put forth effort. SDP was my first class & I am not currently working in the software field. I have had programming experience 10 years back and more recent scripting work. I had to learn Java & Android for the course unlike some people who had both or at least Java background. \n \nEvery Friday there was an assignment due so it was a busy course. Some were easy, some not so much. I had a great group for the project so overall I loved the course. I felt like it was challenging enough for me but not too much, to be discouraging. I learned stuff and more importantly felt confident about getting back to school and taking harder courses. \n\nThere was a lot of gripe from people in the class about how easy the course was and I can see how it might have been. So if you are programming/scripting for work and are not looking for class fillers, please don't bother taking this course. These reviews exist for a reason This is an easy but good course. It teaches many concepts in software engineering that Non-CS students don't learn in school. The concepts of software development tends to be overlooked. A good software is not just good coding. The workload is fine. There is deadline almost every week. It is a good course to refresh your java programming skill or even learn it if you don't have much experience. The grading is lenient. I would actually recommend any Non-CS background student to take this course even though it appears to be easy, but many of the concepts in the course are basic but important to know as a formal CS student and can tell whether you are a CS student or CE/EE student if you don't know them. I would recommend this course if you have no prior software engineering background, though I would skip it if you have had an undergrad SE class or SE work experience. There is no major challenge to the projects themselves, as they aren't designed to test you on your ability to solve problems, just how well you follow process and complete documentation (which isn't a complaint, that's the point of the class!). Unfortunately, there wasn't much engagement in the process beyond wrote tasks and standard documentation. Since the projects are fairly trivial, it seems silly to spend so much time on design and discussion, so hopefully in the future they use projects that are a bit more complex, or maybe having to deal with changing requirements or incomplete requirements. That being said, if you don't have any experience in software development or process, this is probably a good introduction to it. \n\nIf I were to give advice to those taking the class, I would say two things:\n 1. Be careful with your time, the Summer section was quite fast-paced, and it is easy to fall behind. The instructors insist on making things due on Friday, and make things *very* awkward for those who work. You can get some of the projects done on the weekend they open, but Piazza comments and project errata will appear during the week, so you still have to work around your weekday schedule unfortunately!\n 2. Check your work over until you feel paranoid about it. The instructors are *not* very compassionate nor understanding when it comes to simple mistakes. I personally was only affected by this once at the very beginning of the course, but two of my teammates lost a full letter grade due to this. If something isn't compatible with the auto-grader, or there was a simple typo in a commit hash, function name, etc., then expect to receive zero points for that portion of the assignment, with no real wiggle room! Course lectures provide good examples and walkthroughs. There's a historical context for each lesson which I liked.\n\nThe Android lessons need more work. The group project involves making a Wheel of Fortune app. The implementation is somewhat important, but the bulk of the grade comes from the design documents and project plan that your group creates. I didn't know much in terms of Android development so going from the first individual Android assignment to the group project was a bit of a stretch. Someone else in my group was knowledgeable about Android which helped. You don't get to choose your group, but you can assign preferences for meetings times. Hint: choose to meet early in the week before project deadlines.\n\nIndividual project is implementing a command line utility. The focus is on testing and refactoring.  It's straightforward, and while the black-box testing assignment doesn't provide much in the way of learning, I did find the overall project helpful for thinking about test cases and inputs.\n\nGood course to kick off the OMSCS program and pair with a harder course. The other reviews for this course are accurate. There is a lot of work (and some of it people think is monotonous), but the summer is shorter than the fall and spring semesters, so the amount of work per week is probably higher. \n\nTo prepare for the class, I recommend brushing up on Java and Android development. There are some good classes on Lynda for this purpose. Great class! You learn some very useful stuff, but it can be pretty intense at times as there is a lot of technology introduced and group dynamics to consider. If you don't already know them, you'll be learning eclipse, git (and github), md format, java and android in the first part of the semester. The groups are 3-4 people each, and it can take more time than you expected due to the various concerns of your group members. You'll find that they approach things a bit differently than you do, so you may spend a fair amount of time just sorting that part out. A bit of real life thrown in! At least this semester the groups remain the same from beginning to end. Make sure you don't have plans which will take you away from your computer for a long period of time, as it's heavily group based.  SDP is an extremely well run course. Alex the lecturer, and the instructors are all very responsive on Piazza. Alex also has office hours every week where you can ask more questions if you have them. The course material is well laid out, the assignments are easy to understand what is required, and the lectures are well done. \n\nNow for the not so good:\n\n* This course is easy. I have only a sliver of a Java background, and this was enough to get through the paper just fine. \n* This course covers things like using an IDE and git. If you're a working programmer like myself, you will probably already know this. \n* The grading on the group assignments is focused on the paperwork you produce, not the code. We turned in an assignment that failed half the instructor tests and still got an 80 or 85. \n* There is a significant amount of group work in this paper. I was in a different time zone to my colleagues and ended up doing 6am meetings most of the time. \n* I didn't really enjoy the material. The course is about the software development process, not coding, and it covers a lot of tools that aren't relevant to me as a working programmer, e. g. UML, Rational Unified Process, e. t. c. However this is the point of the course so I shouldn't be too surprised :)\n\nOverall, this is a good paper to take if you're new to OMSCS and want an easier paper to start with, to learn the ropes of taking papers. If you've already met your foundational requirement, and aren't interested in more enterprisey processes, and are looking for challenging papers, then I wouldn't recommend this one. However I must emphasise again, how well Alex and the TA's run this course.  A good, interesting class with projects that do a good job of illustrating the concepts taught in the course. Great course. I would love more emphasis on agile. I enjoyed the group projects, but this is probably because I was lucky in this regard.  TLDR: Great course that teaches the fundamentals of the software development process, however, it uses some outdated practices in what is taught. Professor highly involved along with TAs. Highly recommended. Assignments released on Friday, due Friday (7 days). Makes a good, getting back into academics, course. \n\nPrep: Have good familiarity java and android development; have the ability and time commitments to work with a team to get a group project done. \n\nMy expectations of this class were to refresh some of the basics that I already knew from coding in industry for 7+ years. The class met these expectations, but relied on some outdated information and documentation that is not actually used in the real world industry. \n\nThe course was a great overview of what it takes to develop software from the systems or business side of things. Not just the guts of programming. The course takes you through the steps from initial concept, requirements gathering, documenting designs for approvals, prototyping, reviewing designs again, implementation, testing, and final presentation\\shipment for a software project. \n\nThe class leans more towards requirement gathering and documentation then programming, so be prepared for that. \n\nThe course had almost no flaws in it, besides the team picking process and getting the students to work together, but that is a separate issue. The TAs and professor were very helpful and willing to see the students learn the material. \n\nAs others have mentioned, while this is a decent course for those who are not good programmers, you still need to be able to program to take this course. This is a Computer Science Masters degree after all. This course also has little learning for industry experienced developers, but it worked as a decent transition back into academia after being out of it for a while. This class completely depends on the team. This course is a hit and a miss. The material isn't difficult, however I found the marking (especially without a provided rubric) to be highly disagreeable. The group project is also nice - if you're on a team which knows what they're doing! I was on a team where one person was essentially MIA for the whole time. This has lead to the higher workload and sleepless nights from my part. I found taking AI and ML less stressful than dealing with the group projects in this course (comparatively when I took intro to health informatics, that group project was relatively pleasant)!\n\nAt the rate this course is going - it looks like it will be my first B of my 7 courses in the program. Would not recommend unless it is required for specialization.  Dr. Orso and his Merry Band of TAs did a great job with this course! The lectures were well done, materials were documented, and the projects were perfectly in line with what we were learning and reflected what was presented in the course prereqs and syllabus (as opposed to my experience in another course). \n\nMy only suggestion to future students is that if there's ever a debate as to whether something is required or \"good enough\" (documentation, feature, tests, etc) - be safe, not sorry.  The documentation portion of the class is awful. Seriously. Lets make a full class diagram, use case model, component diagram, deployment diagram, and mockup UI for the most basic application you've ever worked on. Makes you wonder how people swear by UML. Overall though you learn a lot. Especially if you're new to SDP If you are new to programming or to Java, this will definitely be more challenging. It was fairly easy for me because of many years of software development experience. I especially enjoyed the Test-Driven Design element of this course as well as the introduction to agile development. The professor and a couple of the TAs were very active on Piazza and there were several good discussions. The course was well organized and the assignments and expectations were well defined.  This was one of the first courses I took, and I am glad that was the case. It was a comfortable way to get started. I also enjoyed learning how to develop an Android app.  This course feels like the easiest I've taken in the program, but this may be due to the fact that it is very well organized, clearly structured and not ambiguous. There are individual assignments with enough time to complete and a group project that is a small Android app. The lectures are fabulous in their flow and design and quite interesting, even if a lot of it might be familiar to someone working in software development. It was still helpful to have the material laid out in such a fun way. Getting an introduction to Android was also great.\n\nConsidering the ambiguous nature of the rest of the classes I've taken, SDP is now engraved in my mind as a sweet memory. I wish more classes were like this - I feel that many other classes try to cram an inappropriate amount of material, which causes them to be kind of all over the place. Pretty easy class, and you won't learn much if you've done any software development in your career. I was just starting my career when I took this so learning to use git was useful. There's some exposure to developing a basic android app and working with a team which is useful. This class is definitely more valuable at the beginning of the program as opposed to later, and pairs well with anything. The course allows you to practice many things including working with J-Unit for testing, agile development methods and Android development. Although some of the topics will seem rudimentary if you have been working as a developer, they are taught well and help reinforce many good practices.  Excellent class. While I have coding experience, I am not a developer, so many of the material and tools we learned were very interesting and helpful. I can understand why some people get bored if they've been in the industry for a while. The lessons are fun and the assignments build on whats taught in a way that helps reinforce the material. As for the structure of the class, I feel this is a great first representation of what OMS CS is about. Excellent presence from the instructor and the TA's. Any issue posted on Piazza will either be addressed by other students or the faculty in a very timely manner. As stated in previous posts the one wild card is the team you get assigned to. The team assignments are definitely the most time consuming and if you have members that don't participate it could get even more difficult.  This class is very well run by Prof. Orso. My background is in Python programming and I entered with essentially zero Java background aside from the Lynda course you may use provided by GaTech. \n\nGood: Well run (as stated previously), videos are well produced and the assignments are very clear in what they expect*. \n\nBad: TAs took an extremely long time to get us our grades. This was very frustrating because rapid feedback is always appreciated. Our class project (#2) depended on one of our past assignments, on which we did not receive feedback. This made it quite tricky to navigate. Additionally, as with any class with group projects, some teammates will be good, others bad. \n\nTakeaway: I learned plenty of Java, and I feel that I've successfully polished my ability to use Git well. I would definitely recommend this as a first course to the GaTech program, as it is a good intro to the program's systems itself (Piazza, Buzzport, T-Square). Overall 9/10.  This is my first class in OMSCS and this is a very good introductory class to OMSCS and Software Engineering. I\u2019m working as Software Engineer but I still feel the class is fun and worth taking. It brushed up my git skills and introduced me to Android programming. \n\nThe instructor (Prof. Orso) is very active and always conducts office hours every week, he is also always present in piazza (except nearing the end of the semester, when he and all TAs were overwhelmed with grading and grade challenges). \n\nThe load is quite constant and I spent about 5-7 hours a week, except for the Android team project, which I spent almost 50 hours across 3 weeks span. But that\u2019s more because I wanted to deliver a \u2018nice looking UI\u2019 with a close-to-non-existent Android expertise. \n\nThe contents are pretty straightforward and easy to grasp. There is no exam but instead your grade comes mostly from assignments and projects. Having said that if you want to get an A, you have to focus on the details of each assignment and project, making sure to deliver what the instructors expect from those assignments and projects (make sure to attend/play later the \u2018optional\u2019 office hours too, as often clarifications are given here - even though usually the piazza also has a corresponding thread). For some deliverables, the instructors may deduct quite some points for non-compliant items, so don\u2019t underestimate the seems to be easy assignments and projects. The grades are also not curved (90+ to get an A) so it is important to get a good grade for every assignment/project. \n\nOverall, it is a great course, and I recommend taking it especially for new students as an introductory course to OMSCS and Software Engineering.  Very good and passionate instructor. Made good use of Office Hours time. TA's were helpful. \n\nMake sure you inform instructor early on if one of your project team members is MIA. \n\nCourse was a good review of some of my undergrad work. Very good presentation of Agile and Scrum. The JAVA and Android was a nice change for development tasks. \n\nWork with your group up front to find strengths and weaknesses. When it is your turn to be the task lead stay on top of it. Having team members in 5 time zones can be a challenge but it gives you a perspective of what it will be like for remote collaboration efforts. Professor Orso made the lectures interesting, and we got to work with some cool languages. Grading was fair, and TAs were good at correcting mistakes. Using GIT to grade was a great idea, but I would recommend you check over the grades they give you. I had multiple instances where they used the wrong commit (mistakes happen), but again, they are quick to resolve these issues if you talk to them about it. \n\nCourse is entirely project based, with a group project, and a series of individual projects. Not being able to select your group is annoying, because the group project is pretty large and the time frame is really small. I ended up getting a team where two students did not pull their weight, and I had to do a large portion of the work, putting me in the position where I had to play catch up for that class and another class for the rest of the semester. Some of the projects can feel like busy work as well. \n\nKnowing Java is ideal, but knowing Android will really help you on the group project. I enjoyed a lot of the material and thought it was a good course for people who have not been working in a software company that primarily uses object oriented programing.  I have mainly been in silicon and embedded systems development (C heavy) so found the material quite good as a survey of understanding potential processes outside of that environment.  The weekly assignments differed greatly in difficultly and completeness of instructions, the TAs would help clarify - but if they thought it was clear enough they would stop.  \n\nI really disliked the Friday due date of assignments - the only way to make this work with the curriculum is to stay one week ahead of the published schedule otherwise the weekend is wasted as you don't have the background needed to make progress.  This made the course interfere with work much more than it should have, particularly for the bigger assignments.\n\nGrading was always really late - especially annoying for assignments that built on one another (and it turned out the multi-phase assignments only got one grade at the end.)   This is a great class to start the OMCS program off with! Gave me a good opportunity bang off some rust programming with Java and I got to learn some new stuff with android development. This class is project driven, which I really liked and I felt the projects were generally challenging/interesting. First, the good: Professor Orso is a good lecturer and is passionate about the material. There are some interesting individual and group projects. I particularly liked the ones on Android and White-Box Testing. I plan on using what we learned about Extended TSL for automating test cases at work. \n\nThe bad:\n\n- Holy hell, the TAs are awful. I'm more than half-way done with my OMSCS degree, so this isn't my first rodeo - this has been without a doubt my worst course experience. The co-head TAs (Will and Erin) are defensive, easy to anger, slow to answer threads, and almost purposefully ambiguous in their replies to simple yes or no questions (e. g. \"is X a requirement?\" or \"Should the behavior be X or Y?\"). I'm a pretty agreeable person, but I feel like I need to get my blood pressure examined after each interaction with them on Piazza. \n\n- The assignment docs are poorly proof-read, contain errors, and are often ambiguous. \n\n- There is an assignment due every Friday night (or early Saturday depending on your time-zone). Assignments are released the previous Saturday morning. This wouldn't be so bad if the TAs were responsive - but posts routinely take 2-3 days to get a response. Usually the responses are ambiguous, defensive, and over-all unhelpful. All in all, this makes for a stressful weekly experience. SUGGESTION TO THE PROFESSOR: Please consider releasing assignments 1-2 days early (Thursday instead of Saturday). Or work with your TAs to get better response times. Or have the TAs do a better job at proof-reading the assignments beforehand. \n\n- Feedback is non-existent. It's November 10th, and we're still waiting for grades on assignments that were submitted back in September. The feedback we have gotten has been one or two poorly worded sentences. A silver lining is that the TAs grade easy; but I'm here to learn and feedback is crucial to that process. Other OMSCS classes do a really good job at feedback, so it's definitely possible with a class this size. This was my first OMS course. I enjoyed the video lectures and Professor Orso does a great job keeping you engaged in the subject matter. I really appreciate his breadth of knowledge and enthusiasm for the material. I was very impressed (and relieved) by the quality of the online delivery system and Piazza classroom forum. \n\nWhat I liked most about CS 6300 is that it differed from your typical boring, textbook heavy software development course that beats SDLC to death. There is no textbook and no exams. Just quizzes and projects. I really enjoyed the projects because they were opportunities to apply course concepts. We learned Git, Android development, MD format, JUnit testing, and so much more! Many of the tools, such as IntelliJ and Android Studio (and even Git), I had never touched before. I learned so many useful tools and concepts that directly applied to my professional work. \n\nAlthough the majority of reviewers rate this course as easy, I caution others not to under-estimate the effort required. I finished with an A but it did require an all-nighter once or twice to meet deadlines and weekly deliverables. Having a programming background definitely helps, especially Java. If you have zero programming background or you're not strong in it then be prepared to suffer a little. The course will not be impossible but I found it challenging enough to meet deliverables because the week seemed to go by so fast between keeping up with lectures, quizzes, and the assignments themselves. I have over 10 years experience developing in C++, C#, Java, VB. NET, SQL, and some HTML and PHP and I felt I was barely prepared. There was still a lot of new learning I had to do and had to do it fast in order to complete assignments on time. I am thankful my group had others with programming experience. It is true that grading is slow but I feel the TAs were doing the best they could. I never felt the slow grading affected my progress or learning. Some weeks were more and some less of course, depending on schedule. Group projects aren't my favorite either but do make a certain amount of sense for this sort of class. Lots of busy work but not too much that is difficult if you know Java. Liked the course better than I thought I would and got more out of it than I thought I would (my career has been SDP... but just goes to show you CAN teach an old dog new tricks).  Eesh, I really hate group projects. In this case, we had a team member who was pretty much non-contributing, which is just totally lame. I'll be on the watch for classes with group projects in the future, and I'm going to try to avoid them. What a pain.  The testing requirements are a little more 'elaborate'(you have to answer all the quizzes on udacity, which makes it hard to download the lectures and watch them). The grading requirements for a project/assignment are badly defined, by design. This is to stimulate real life requirements, not something I particularly enjoy but I understood the need. Group projects were fun, but I suspect this depends on the project partners you get. Mine are great so it was pretty easy going Very much an intro-level course, you'll dabble in a couple of different testing and design options, work on a few Android apps. The group projects seem to vary from person to person, but I enjoyed mine. Those were certainly the most time and labor-intensive parts of the class. On other weeks I could sometimes spend as little as an hour getting an assignment done. Enjoyed the class.  If you are familiar with java, it should be easy. It is a interesting class and you can learn a lot.  This class can get a bit boring. However, you learn some useful development methodologies that are useful when you work on long projects or when you work on group projects. Also, you learn about test driven development which is a useful thing to know. Android development in this class is not that difficult. For the first android assignment, you practically follow a tutorial by the instructor with minor changes. For the group project, you will also use android but it is not that difficult as well. You will need to know how to integrate databases in your app as well as how to navigate through views in android. Other assignments are not bad and can be completed comfortably within 2 days. The instructor and TAs are involved and quite active on Piazza and generally do a good job in answering questions and clarifications. Generally I have favorable view of the course. As someone who coming from an optical physics background, I've worked on device drivers and algorithm, but there were things that I'm peripherally aware that are missing my background. This class filled in the knowledge gaps in software development process, and pieces of best practices over the years made sense to me holistically. Most of the time crunch will be with the team project. \nHighlights:\n1. ) Learn to develop in asynchronous, distributed team environment using github. Shifting and changing roles. \n2. ) Learn to develop android app in 1 week (or less)\n3. ) Learn to do simple software architecture with UML tools\n4. ) blackbox test interface development with TDD. whitebox test on code coverage.  If you have any experience as a *software developer* this is a very easy course for you. Another way to look at it: you will not get a lot out of this course.\nLectures are very light and superficial, there were 7 assignments doable in a rather short time, an individual project and a group project. There was no exam. Grading is generous (but not curved). The average median over all projects was 95.\n\nThe group project can be time consuming depending on your team. Teams get assigned based on availability and experience (you fill out a google form for that) - you can't choose your team members.\n\nOverall: most of the time I felt like I was wasting my time. Exception: the group project where I was working day and night. This class is necessary. I wish it weren't. You get to know some important tools. You're given vague descriptions of a bunch of documents to create. So you google them and make your best guess about what you're supposed to be doing and fill the page up with as many official sounding words as possible. They teach you just enough to know you don't know what you're doing. The grading is the most nitpicky grading imaginable. If you don't include an exact word they're searching for you get points off. Getting questions answered is an adventure. Some weeks- no problem. Other weeks you might as well smack your head into a wall for all the good it will do. If you're assigned a group where people withdraw or don't have time to do their share, you'll have to do it all yourself. Expect 15-20 hours if you're not very experienced and you're having to do a lot of the group project yourself. Overall, frustrating.  Overall, a great first class to take in the OMSCS program. Of course, I was fortunate to have an excellent group to work with throughout the semester. Lecture content was presented clearly, however some things required extra research on my part (ie. Android development, JUnit testing, GitHub usage, etc. ), but hey THAT'S WHAT GOOGLE IS FOR. Prof. Alex and the course instructors are very good about responding to PIazza posts. You DO need an understanding of Object Oriented concepts, even if it's not Java. I've had some Java and C# training (but minimal experience) so I was able to pick up the material fairly easily. I'm glad to have learned some of the administrative and testing components to software development (inc. the project plan, use case diagrams, testing methods, etc. ). \nGROUP PROJECTS --> As mentioned, I was fortunate to be in an awesome group. However lots of people were not so fortunate. There IS a teammate rating form given at the end of each project because of this.  Hate the group work too. Deciding on requirements with a diverse team can be very difficult. Finding meeting times was very challenging. This class was sometimes more difficult to deal with and fit into my schedule than Machine Learning Pretty easy material. But, depending on the role you play and group dynamics, it can be a lot of work. If you are an experienced Android dev, you'll find it easy. If you've never used Java, it's going to be tough. Also there are a ton of design documents to produce and grading wise these are as important as the code, so don't underestimate them.  Lets start with the most common complaint in the class. Too much programming. I do not agree. The programming was very light and very reasonable. I believe if you have trouble with the programming in this class, that may be a sign to find a new major. I haven't done much Java (mostly C#) and I had no issues translating between them. The other complaint is about group work. I imagine this depends on your group. I had a great group. 3 programmers and a professional PM. We spent a lot of time together, which was the hardest part, but we worked well together and I learned a lot about group work. Some weeks I spent very little time in this class. The start is slow and was a little boring, but when the group projects started I spent quite a bit more time talking to my group. We likely didn't have to, but we did. The lectures are entertaining and insigtful. They do a good job of creating interest and are a good starting point for further learning.  Overall, this was a good course, but IMHO is mainly due to the level of involvment from the professor and TAs. The content was decent but I would have preferred much more focus on Agile. Knowledge of Java would help but anyone with reasonable coding experience in any language should pick it up quick. My one serious concern is that, though the team projects did take some significant time and effort, the individual assignments were relatively simple (but also fun and good learning tools). However, it seemed many students made them much harder for themselves than necessary but you couldn't help others too much in that respect without violating the honor code. I think KISS and YAGNI should be part of the lesson plan.  This was the first class I took through OMSCS. I enjoyed the class overall and learned a great deal too. Unlike some other OMSCS classes (that I've taken since taking one), I thought the lectures were done very well in this class. The professor and TAs were very helpful on piazza. Overall I enjoyed this class, and I was able to apply some of the material I learned immediately. Great focus on practical topics. It was more work than I expected based on reading this sheet beforehand, but that's probably because I was new to java, git hub, and pretty much everything covered in the course. There were a few times I was frustrated with some of the programming assignments.  This class stays true to its mission, which--as the name suggests--is to build up the 'process' parts of the skill set as opposed to the programming or theory skills you'll get in other classes. This means that it may not be the best option for those that already have experience as a developer, but for those that don't, you'll get useful practice with Git, unit testing, UML, white-box testing, and black-box testing, among others. The assignments and individual project account for over 70% of the final grade, the group project accounts for another 25% (split 15% for the actual project and 10% for your teammates' assessment of your collaboration), with a a few remaining free points from Udadcity tracking whether you watched the lectures and did the quizzes. As long as you follow instructions, the grading isn't very strict. This class pairs well with other classes, though be aware that the workload during the month or so of the group project can be higher than for typical weeks. Professor Orso and the TAs were very involved and helpful. My main complaint was that the pace of grading was pretty slow. This was the first course I took as an OMS student and it was a great introductory course to get used to the framework of OMS (Piazza, Udacity, T-Square). \n\nThe assignments and project guidelines were fairly straightforward, though there was a pretty wide disparity in grading leniency among TAs. I'd expect rubrics in future iterations of this course. Best advice I can give would probably be to establish how and when your team will meet/communicate/collaborate for projects early on, and try to keep up with the Piazza threads. \n\nProf Orso had great lectures and was very consistent with office hours. I really enjoyed the Hangouts Live format of office hours. Overall, great introductory course for the program! The name of this course should be Ambiguous Software Test instead of Software Development Process. There are 5 formal assignments besides Survey and Github usage, and 3 of the 5 are tests. And the whole individual project focuses on testing. Assignment 6 uses a tool named 'TSLGenerator' invented in 1989! I think lots of students are younger than it. Deliverable 3 of the project asks to write test cases to cover 100% of the classes which are invisible to us. It made me like a robot when I spent several hours on trying all the combinations to achieve the goal. What is worse, the whole course is ambiguous. The descriptions of assignments are ambiguous. Most of topics in piazza are discussing the meaning of assignments. The TA (if not a forum mediator)'s answers are ambiguous. For example, a student's test cases cover 98% of the main class and he/she wants to know the weight of the other 2%. \"You can get partial score\". Do you think this kind of answer helpful? The comments of assignments are always ambiguous. I got one line comment for most of assignments even I lost lots of points. I have to say this is the worst course I have taken from this program.  This course was a lot of fun. I could see where anyone with significant development experience might find it boring but I myself enjoyed it and encourage any new OMSCS student to take it. Dr. Orso was active on Piazza and held regular offices hours. Lecture material was well put together and entertaining. The TAs were very active on Piazza. There was only one group project that lasted about 3 full weeks. For individual homework, I advise that you do pay close attention to details. The material isn't very difficult but you will lose a large number of points for small mistakes that could have easily been avoided by reading the assignment more closely. If you have some development and Java experience before, this course would be very easy. I recommend this course for the fresher to get to know how OMSCS program works. ", 
    "CS-6310": " I learnt UML and OOAD back in 1999 when the three Amigos were the three Amigos - Booch, Jacobson and Rumbaugh\nhttps://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language\nI had to switch careers during the 2001 meltdown. Its good to be back learning OOAD again. \nThis course has a very interesting perspective on teaching UML and OOAD. \nYou have to know or learn ILP and java since the solver is java based\nThere are no fixed answers to the projects since in real life there are no fixed design solutions. \nThe same with the requirements. In real life requirements tend to be vague and it takes a good analyst to fill in the blanks. \nTake this course with an open mind and you will learn a lot.  Overall the course wasn't terrible but in some ways misses the mark. You work through building out an application from the requirements stage -> initial individual implementation -> expansion of requirements -> expanded group implementation. This process is incredibly helpful as it presents things that you do in the real world. \n\nWhat I didn't like was the weight put on sticking to OOP principles throughout the process. While the instructors have to pick some sort of way of evaluating code, picking specific programming paradigms/features cause problems as it is outside the stated goals of project architecture/documentation/design/implementation. That said, if you have any sort of OOP background you should be OK in this course (another important piece of info is this course is very much a \"do your assignments in Java\" course). \n\nI got the feeling that this course is somewhat evolving and some of the lecture material isn't useful for the full implementation of the projects. Hoping that GaTech addresses this disparity going forward to make sure the assignments and lectures converge a bit better. I took CS-6310 in Spring, 2018 with Dr. Mark Moss. This was my first OMSCS course. I felt like the course was a good first course. It was not too difficult, but it did require me to put in about 10 hours per week on average. Dr. Moss and the a couple TAs were very involved in the course and I feel like they communicated very well compared to what I've heard about in other courses. The course was organized and well-run.\n\nThere were no tests, just assignments, which included a group project in the final 3-4 weeks. The main assignments were 2 design documents using UML, an approx. 6-7 page (double-spaced) research paper, and and the final group project. There were of course the Udacity videos and some required readings, but the readings did not count as part of a grade. The content was fairly interesting, but I felt like a little too much emphasis was put on UML and not enough on architectural styles. You can't really work ahead on the assignments as they are released at specified times. I had taken UML classes before, so this was more like a refresh on the concepts. \nThe only problem at least with this summer term was that the feedback took too long for each assignment.  It was an ok course. I have a lot of professional development experience so I didn't learn anything eye opening. I was hoping I would enjoy it more than my undergrad design course (after 14 years on the job). It didn't really turn out that way. As with a lot of courses, the workload varies depending on the assignments due. One thing I didn't care for is the team-based projects. I had a great team and enjoyed working with them but some times it felt like I couldn't really do things on my schedule, so I would have preferred working alone. \n\nThe high point for me was the first project which had an interesting problem not related to software architecture. I had a lot of (stressful) fun trying to figure it out. So I will probably start focusing more on those types of classes.  As has been said in other reviews, each project builds upon the next, and there is little to no feedback between turning in one part, and starting the next so you have no idea if you are going down the wrong path or not. The last piece of the project turns into a group project and you have to merge each members ideas/work together or start from scratch. I think this was one of the ONLY group projects I have enjoyed, mostly because everyone knew what they were doing and actually did the work. It was spectacular. Hardest part for me was some of the diagrams you have to build. A few of them didn't really have good samples so I had to do some comparison from the real world examples I could find and hope it correlated back to what was expected in the class. \n\nSoftware Architecture and Design is what I do for a living, so this class was a breeze for the most part. Completely forgot to turn in one of the projects (wrong date on my calendar, lost 15% of my grade right of the bat) and still got an A. Before this class I had a rather strong hatred for Java. I can honestly say this was the first time I used Java, that I actually enjoyed. The course title describes the course exactly. The Udacity videos are very long but thorough. The most tedious part of the course is the UML diagrams, but once everyone found out we can access LucidChart for free with our @gatech. edu emails, it made the process much easier. At the end of the course, there is a final group project that involves creating a user application for a course registration simulation. If your group is responsive and you're willing to put in the work, your results and grade will reflect that. For me, the main takeaway from this course is a better appreciation and interest in software design. \nBeyond that, if you've taken a Software Architecture course before in your undergrad, most of the material will be very familiar.  Super dissapointed in this class. I feel like there is a huge rift between the amount of work I have done and the amount I have learned. Understanding lecture material does not coincide with Project success... hopefully if you take this class their will be enough team members with advanced Java skills. Dealing with many different groups with different members in different time zones also subtracts from the quality of the course. Strange and contradictory assignment requirements and nitpicking grading... the list goes on. I feel the quality of CS6300 was many times higher than this course.  The only reason the class is somewhat difficult is because it's SO boring. The material is completely irrelevant, and mostly has nothing to do with the real world. Very disappointed in this class, and is by far the worst I've taken in the program.  This class has a high workload: multiple 7 page papers that are each worth around 4% of your grade, projects that have a program and two 7-10 page papers worth 15% (total). They are group assignments but because of the high number of students dropping out and people without a programming background you are lucky if you have 3 people working on the project. Compared to other high-workload classes, SAD isn't rewarding because I don't think that the material is all that interesting or useful (at least to me).  The concepts were not that hard to learn, but were time consuming to implement, especially as a team. This course is similar to SW Dev, both in the sense that you have a group project and as far as content goes. I do remember the lessons being a bit dry, and not fully feeling that I had a grasp on all the design patterns and principles when the course ended. This is a good course to take as the first one in the program. It is easy to understand and the assignments and projects are well balanced. Mr Moss is an excellent lecturer and the classes are good. There is one group project, but it is not a big deal if the group is responsible.  The course is a decent mixture of software design with actual implementation. It has no tests, but focuses on a semester-long project that has various design and implementation phases. You will have to make a few UML diagrams (Class, Sequence, etc), write requirements, and develop the designed project in Java. \n\nIf you already have experience with Java, and are familiar with Object-Oriented concepts, this course won't really be hard at all. If you aren't very experienced with programming in general, I feel that this is a nice starting point to practice these concepts and learn in a very practical way. \n\nThe only downside were the lectures, which I didn't find too interesting, nor did they help me too much with the project per-se, except for a few ones that talk about UML Class Diagrams and others that talk about converting requirements to classes and methods. \n\nIn summary, this is a good starting point if you aren't too experienced with programming. If you are, but want to start off the OMSCS with a not-too-difficult class just to get an idea of how the whole program runs, this is a good option as well. However, I wouldn't suggest it to an experienced software engineer. For those students, there are other courses in the OMSCS that would teach them more useful things. If you want the same basic content in a much-better-prepared course, take 6300. They two classes use several of the same lectures; and both cover analysis, design, and architecture. The lectures are not very helpful as they keep referencing optional material in the course wiki that winds up being required to complete homework, and the prereqs are sadly understated (you need a good grasp of UML/OCL going in, be ready to build linear programming solutions). Be ready to buy/read all optional material listed in the course syllabus to just keep up. If the course description had been more accurate up front, I would definitely never have signed up for this class.  Enjoyed the course. Loved how the assignments built off the prior assignments. \n\nNot sure if videos should be refreshed however towards the end the videos were not very helpful. \n\nInstructor and TAs were very responsive. Has to be the worst class I've taken in my college career. \nThe workload is enormous, topics are not relevant to the real world, instructional materials such as the videos are beyond terrible. \nThe only good thing I can say about this class is that it ends.  This class was okay. Not sure I learned a whole lot. Seemed like a repeat of 6300 honestly. The lectures are long and pretty boring. The assignments are mostly UML diagrams with the exception of the one coding project you do throughout the semester. Grading is suppppper slow and pretty careless. I constantly had to ask for it to be reviewed. No tests. All Java, cmd line stuff. You should know or have time to learn how to troubleshoot threading and animation in Java. Items (e. g. , sequence diagrams, state charts) taught in theory only, learning how to apply the concepts to Java code is DIY. Enough material wasn't ready this semester (project solutions for the prof, a. uml model for the ocl assignment, a 3 credit workload) that refunds should have been allowed throughout. Time-pressured teammates drop, conclude there's no time to communicate adequately. Positives: LogicBlox and Geeks in Black lessons The topics are interesting, the projects and overlapping assignments done as a team are a nightmare for coordinating during non-work hours. Many people dropped the course because of this, which made it even harder for their team members.  The less enterprise you are, the less happy you will be with the materials. Team-based projects and assignments could go either way. It could be painful, very much so even, if the team doesn't have a good dynamic. On the other hand, it feels really good with strong teammates.  In general, it was a good course. It was much better organized and prepared than a few other OMSCS courses, and office hours were regular and informative. I'd think that both professor and TA's could have participated much more actively in Piazza, as it was usually necessary to wait till office hours to get responses to some of most straightforward questions, even questions about logistics and organization. \nThe unpleasant surprise, however, was that the group project, which was supposed to be most highly weighted in the overall grade, was never actually scored (or perhaps it was scored, but score was not disclosed to the students?). Eventually, I of course did get the overall grade for the course at the required deadline, so I thought the project grade is just a little bit delayed, but up to this moment I still see neither grader comments, nor the score for the main project. Don't know if I just missed it somehow. Perhaps other folks could chime in if that is indeed the case. Ditto most of the above comments (especially #12 and #14... 'Artificially Difficult' gave me a chuckle). Most folks who have been in industry for a while are unlikely to be impressed. Many of the lectures are just recitations of long lists of whatever (UML diagrams, architectural patterns, etc. ) without any depth. And a closed-book, 60-minute final exam containing plenty of questions of the form 'Regurgitate the 4 types of blah covered in the Leroy & Jenkins paper' was an appropriate ending.  'This was an interesting course. As mentioned earlier, there are 3 projects which take up a lot of time, only if you are actively \ninvolved. The assignements are interesting and you get to apply what you learn in the lectures. You are free to choose your own team for assignements. THe project teams are pre assigned and your team pretty much determines how you end up doing your projects. THe projects are Java heavy and the teams are assignend such that there is one or two Java pros in each time. The proficiency of the Java person will determine the outcome. They are vast enough that everyone in the team will be involved if they so desire. The second project was very physics heavy, but I enjoyed doing the third project. The professor and TA is actively involved in piazza and had many hangout sessions. There are rooms for improvement but, overall, this is a good course. ' Same as above comments. The workload is big and time consuming and yes you will learn some things, but the majority of my group(s) time was spent debugging code and not really focusing as much on the documents like we were suppose to do. The projects span about a month or so and require good teamwork or else you end up pulling all nighters on Sunday nights getting it finished and during the project period you will also have 1 - 2 group assignments with different groups usually. The videos were informational yet a little dull, but watchable. Overall it wasn't diffcult, but again expect to spend a lot of time doing group work in this class The aeronautics prof was admitttedly 'monitoring', rather than attempting to answer questions, and the TAs had only just taken the course themseslves. Again, the assigned projects weren't done by anyone ahead of time (aside from a late, failed attempt). And again as a result important staff steerage was bum. <p/> I was retaking the course to ask the many questions I ran out of time to pose last semester, but w/o the prof of origin no one could answer any of them (mostly harder questions about the videos that still deserve an answer). Expect to do creative writing, e. g. , describe your algorithms that don't exist as if they do.  Expect a lot of group work on poorly designed projects and exams. While the professor is very enthusiastic, his lectures are very dull. The workload is so much because of the tedium, not the challenge. Unless the projects change, expect to spend too much time research math formulas and debugging temperature modeling than actually understanding architecture design.  This course felt like a continuation of Software Development Process. It is not meant to be, but the topics built upon what I had already learned, so I'd recommend you to take CS6300 before taking this one. \n\nAgain, be ready to write lots of documentation and spend a long time diagramming UML. There's also quite a bit of Java involved, so make sure you've got a good understanding of the language before adventuring in this class. \n\nThere are several assignments where you'll be modeling solutions to different problems and writing a lot of content. I specifically remember the Stateflow diagram problem stealing more than a few hours of sleep from my nights. \n\nTo me, the best part of the course was learning optimization with Gurobi and applying it to a real problem. There were three projects, all related to an application that needed to optimize the scheduling of classes. It was an exciting and challenging exercise. The final deliverable takes time, so start as soon as possible. \n\nThe final exam wasn't particularly complicated and it was open notes. You can pass it using the video lectures alone. I studied like crazy and then found it to be easier than expected. \n\nOn this class, you work on teams. I began to be very picky during the selection process, and I ended up with a great team. We had our challenges but ended up pulling through and completing all the work on time. The class content is not difficult but the workload and the high amount of content makes it a difficult course. In my opinion, there is too many assignments and projects. It feels like the professor tries to have enough assignments and projects so we can put the class material into practice. The end result is a class that is heavy in assignments/projects and you end up spending a lot time here. If you plan to take this class either make it the only class for the semester or make sure you other classes are easy.  If you have a background in designing or architecting a system, this course should be a good refresher course. The topic presented is broad and the professor presented it thoroughly. That being said, some of the lectures only provide brief discussion and then it is up to your curiosity. The amount of knowledge you learn, hence, depends on your initiatives. \n\nI found the assignment was quite okay and the grading is fair. Piazza forums was active and the TA were really engaged in answering the questions. This helps a lot in the assignment because the feedback for your submission might not be delivered on time for you to work on the next task (and most of the assignments are basically refinement of previous assignment). \n\nSomething that I think might be improved is to include modern architecture like microservices or SOA and more examples on the popular frameworks/tools for the implementation. It might be good since most of the students are working professional in the industry. I have finished the class. If this were my first OMSCS course, I would likely not continue in the program. I hope I can give feedback that will be constructive. First, there should be fewer assignments, they should be shorter, and they should be individual. I say this because I know a limiting factor is the workload on the graders, so some combination of fewer/shorter assignments can result in them grading the same number of pages as they do with the current set-up. Second, the projects need to be set up in a way that recognizes teams do not meet in person, and that teams are comprised of a wider variety of CS backgrounds than one would find on the on-campus program. People without programming experience can't contribute to the code, nor can they contribute much to documents that require understanding of the code. Third, the administration of the final exam has been a disaster. More than a few lucky students have been allowed up to three hours to take the test by their proctors, while others given only 60 minutes. To do well in the course, you must have some lucky combination of getting assigned to the right project teams, getting assigned to a lax grader, and getting a proctor who gives you far more than the allotted time for the final exam.  The projects in the course need to be restructured a bit. Too much emphasis on figuring out Physics-related requirements takes focus away from the project purpose of learning about Software Arch and Design. About 10% of project work was directly related to what we learnt in course. Rest of completely irrelevant. I thought the assignments were good. They reinforced things learnt in lectures. But they team based and that should not be the case. They are small enough for individual work. Plus the learing would be better if the entire assignment was done by a single person. Currently, sections of assignments are split up and you rarely get a full view of the topic at hand. Projects should be cut down in scope and grading emphasis should shift a bit more towards assignments. \nSince I had teammates who were in my timezone or in the zones at max 3 hours away, coordination wasnt really an issue. I am glad projects were team based since that is one way to meet other people in the course and learn from them. \nThe course has some great content like design patterns, design pricipiles and architectural styles. However, first section focuses on UML/OCL and pretty much everyone who had sw dev experience said that it is not very practical. We spent a lot of time on that in the course and during projects and it feels like a waste of time. Instead, if the lectures focuesd more on the other three topics I mentioned and go in depth about them, it will be useful. Some of the lectures on these topic were just 'read-a-list-from-telepromptor' type and that was really disappinting. \nWith some modifications, this can be a great course.  My only complaint about the projects is that there was a significant amount of Physics domain knowledge required. Thankfully, on each team I was on there was always a physics guy, which was invaluable. The assignments can easily be done on your own, but I believe the group requirement for the assignments was to make things easier on the markers. Coordinating a group on the assignments was trivial; however coordinating the group for the projects was decidedly more difficult. I had two great teams, and one bad team, but I wouldn't use that as a reason to get rid of the group work. I found the group work a great way to meet other people in the OMSCS program. The course web site states that you need to know how to program, and that there will be group work. A few small tweaks, and this course will be awesome. This course is a lot of work, but I wouldn't steer clear of it.  This course - at its core - teaches two things:\n\n1) the syntax and conventions of UML diagrams: class, sequence, state chart make up the major players. Other diagrams get supporting roles. \n\n2) the taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\n\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n1) grades focus on the _syntax_ of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming. \n\n2) in summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments. \n\n3) also in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback. \n\n4) another summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.  When I took this course it was a tremendous amount of work. It was not an easy course and the way that it is taught varies from Professor to Professor. That being said, I would not take this course with any other course. I would recommend that it be taken by itself. The subjects that are covered are important and work to enhance your domain knowledge. this class required a lot of work. it also required having a good team. We ended up with a good team initially and picked up some other good members before the end of the semester. it's one of the most time consuming classes taken so far in the program. It was both interesting and rewarding. Learned a lot along the way. 50% Projects\n20% Assignments\n20% Exam\n10% Class Participation\n\nThe projects were and assignments were doable if you had a good team, but this course is entirely team dependent. The good thing is that unlike some other courses, you can choose your team members. The exam is straightforward as long as you watched the lectures, or did the assignments. The second project was pretty nice, since it allowed you to develop a whole system, and allowed the students to work with many different components and languages, which I found useful. The biggest annoyance with the projects is that they require you to interact with a Gurobi which is very poorly documented and hard to use. I spent more time in this course learning that Gurobi than I did doing anything else. That being said, you can pass this course or get an A, as long as you put in the time and the work. I am a professional software developer who was looking for some formal architecture teaching and the course fits that bill. I found the course lectures to be rather thorough but dry at times (Hey, it is Software Architecture so you can only make it so exciting). The course took you through design and implementation of a Java application. Therefore, you certainly need to be able to program a working basic application that will become more complex as it shifts to the group stage of the course. \n\nMy only disappointment with this class is that if you were unsure of a direction you were working towards in your design, you would not get feedback for several weeks which is after the next assignment or two were due. They are very clear that you won't get marks off for repeat offenses in the case you didn't get feedback; however, from a learning perspective, this impacted my ability to learn through the feedback while working on the project throughout the course. Assignments were numerous but doable as long as you stay on top of them. Project success was largely dictated by who you chose in your group and whether or not any of them had significant application-building experience. Biggest complaint about the class was that it seemed the majority of the first project had to do with mastering Gurobi, which IMO, had nothing to do with Software Architecture and Design. This was a make it or break it. Thankfully, after many hours, I was able to figure it out. \n\nBiggest upside to the class is once you figured Gurobi out, the rest of the project which included, of course Software Architecture and Design and then implementing that design, was pretty fun. A good project and the implementation could be in any language. \n\nLots of good techniques and knowledge taught here, although, in my 30 years of software development, haven't had to use UML, and probably won't for the remainder of my career, but still good to know. Topics covered are not hard concepts but workload is crazy. This class covers a ton of material while assigning a lot of work. Often having multiple assignment at the same time. This class does not fit well with taking another class at the same time.  This was an extremely time-intensive course. It feels like someone took a software architecture course from 10 years ago and went too deep trying to evaluate it. It felt like the Professor needed to make his mark on the course by adding additional assignments, in this case some problems in Linear Programming. Doubled the course load, poorly-defined requirements, and very little guidance from Professor. TAs run amok (though I have to give them some credit for trying to deal with an overloaded situation).  The material was interesting, and pretty much an example of why I joined the program. However, the workload was very group intensive, and it gets tiring working with and coordinating with a team for nearly every project. I was lucky and had a great team, that not only did well but kept together for the whole course. But still, I vastly prefer to work on my own and at my own pace. In addition, the first programming assignment was awful. It assumed a level of knowledge of Linear Programming that wasn't even hinted at in the prerequisites, and caused a huge amount of problems for students that couldn't interpret the requirements. The required papers were tedious as well. They all followed the same formula, and were harshly graded to strange standards. I really don't feel I learned anything at all from writing the papers.  I liked the lectures and readings, but wish we'd had a chance to explore some of the key subjects (such as design patterns) in more depth. Some of the best lectures were the ones that were more interview/interactive in nature. The team focused nature of every project AND every assignment means you'll spend a lot of time coordinating with other people. The projects (45% of the grade) were physics-focused and we had to spend a lot of time dealing with those aspects of the project, which distracted from time to focus on the software architecture. The final exam covers the entire course, so do yourself a favor and prepare study questions as you go so you don't have to re-review and cram the week before finals! Overall, you'll definitely learn a lot in the class, but some of this stuff has to soak in over time and experience. I think with some tweaks this course could be really great; there were definitely some frustrations (and that's perhaps the price we pay for being the first group to take it online) but I think they are serious about trying to solve those for the next offering.  This class is probably a good first class or one to save to take with another class.  No tests, and most of the work towards the end.  I wrote 5 hours/week here but I am not sure how much it actually was, since I basically just completed every assignment the weekend (day) before it was due.  The group project was the only thing that required scheduling, but if you have a good group like I did then it's not a problem; plus it was an obscenely small % of the total grade.  The periodic assignments, class participation, and peer feedback was a large percentage, and they were very manageable.\n\nThis class went through the motions hitting all the key beats, but focusing mostly on UML class diagrams and state charts.  It then touched on and required us to generate behavior diagrams and a deployment diagram.  There were periodic assignments requiring various diagrams to be generated for various designs, and then there was a group project.  The group project was based on a scenario described in a prior assignment, so the initial work consisted of reviewing the group members' class diagrams and code and combining all the best parts (or picking someone's who got a good grade).  All of that was fine.\n\nThen there was a surprisingly large amount of coding.  It was my first time having to write Java in 10 years or so, and I was surprised, considering design can 100% be done without writing code.  Either way, as you can see from my rating, it was pretty easy overall, but I would just be warned that there is significant coding required.  Also the videos were weird; I didn't think they were bad at the time, but having taken a couple more classes since I can see they weren't great.  Also, they didn't always have anything to do with what we were actually generating for the assignments and the project, but the state chart ones were OK. Not bad -- just not super interesting. I do designs at work frequently and the details in this course I definitely learned but felt that I would never need to dive this deep 95% of the time. Would skip this course if did it again Assignments are all group-based and require an obnoxious amount of time. Material is useful if you have never worked professionally or have a weak background in software engineering methodology. Expect the the time requirements of this class to impact your other concurrent classes.  The aeronautics prof was admitttedly 'monitoring', rather than attempting to answer questions, and the TAs had only just taken the course themseslves. Again, the assigned projects weren't done by anyone ahead of time (aside from a late, failed attempt). And again as a result important staff steerage was bum. <p/> I was retaking the course to ask the many questions I ran out of time to pose last semester, but w/o the prof of origin no one could answer any of them (mostly harder questions about the videos that still deserve an answer). Expect to do creative writing, e. g. , describe your algorithms that don't exist as if they do.  I really wasn't a fan of this course. The readings in the class were good, and I was fine with most of the lectures, but the quizzes didn't help reinforce any of the concepts in my opinion. Also the TAs were slow graders, and took quite awhile sometimes to respond on piazza. A ton of the topics are pretty much stuck in the 80s/90s of SAD, so a lot of it isn't really relevant to today. The class is pretty easy if you have some programming knowledge, especially since there are no exams. 50% Projects\n20% Assignments\n20% Exam\n10% Class Participation\n\nThe four projects build on one another to ultimately produce an app that uses a linear programming engine (Gurobi) to make course-enrollment recommendations given student/admin input. \n\nThe assignments require writing a document covering a particular topic. I thought pursuing CS would be an end to writing essays, but I was wrong. \n\nThe final is open-book, take-home. As long as you've watched and internalized the lectures, it's straightforward.  I was hoping to get a glimpse into modern software architecture and design techniques, but instead, I got UML. In my own experience as a software engineer, it has been sufficient to simply be on the same page as business partners and make sure you understand their requirements. Regular code reviews with senior team members and architects would help to ensure proper code design and quality. I have never once had the need to \"translate\" requirements into any kind of UML diagram. The assignments had a lot of \"busy work\" around this UML and in one case there was even an essay portion to discuss the pros and cons of various architectural styles. I actually found that useful despite it being a bit tedious. \n\nHaving coded in Java for many years between school and work, I found the coding assignments to be a breeze. Having the last two assignments be group projects really didn't help matters. I went all out on the last assignment to make sure the team would get high marks, even though I didn't need them. The last assignment was valued at only 100 points (10% of grade) but I feel like it should have been a lot more given the amount of effort that was required to complete it. \n\nThe lectures weren't particularly engaging and there was a requirement to complete all the quizzes in them to get full participation marks. After the first few lectures that introduce the student to UML and OCL, I didn't feel like I needed the knowledge provided in them to complete the assignments. Indeed, I watched the first two and a half parts, then never watched them again until I had completed *all* the assignments (only to get the participation points). In the end, it was a very average course for me. Not particularly bad, but not great either. 1) This course is extremely difficult on very many levels. Though the course name is SAD (D stands for Design) this is course involved too much Code Development. So unless you are GREAT in Java programming (I mean, you need to be a Guru in Java, being good enough just won't cut it) please do yourself a favor and skip this course. Mind you, they don't teach you Java on this course at all. \n\n2) All projects are cumulative which is not a bad thing but they take their sweet time to grade and return the previous projects, so if you make mistakes in the previous ones you carry them on to your next projects. So it is a double whammy!\n\n3) One TA admitted to me that they were instructed to be extremely stringent in grading. Tons of marks were deducted for very flimsy reasons. Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn't change anything. No motivation to study, correct the mistakes and improve at all. \n\n4) Tries to cover a lot of topics without giving sufficient, valid examples (eg. OCL). And then you get dinged for that (for something you were never taught to begin with!). \n\n5) Absentee professor. Professor doesn't teach this course. He doesn't appear in any of the course videos or lectures and rarely visits Piazza. Office hours are conducted by TAs and sometimes the professor pops in there. In the 8 OMSCS courses I have taken so far, I have never seen this. The Professors always taught their respective classes. \n\n6) Do NOT expect any grade curving. Even if you score 79. 99%, you will get only a \"C\". For some other courses you can easily get a \"B\" or even \"A\" for 79%. \n\n7) As another student pointed out, this course is way out of touch with the real world. I have been a designer/developer for 20+ years now. Never ever worked on any UML translations. The assignments are not difficult, especially with teams. Most, if not all, of the assignments could be accomplished by a single person, so dividing amongst 4 or 5 people makes them easy (For one assignment, the TA's recommendation for splitting work was for everyone to do it themselves and compare answers). However, constantly changing teams for every assignment and project is a nightmare; plus, they overlap. In eight days I had been on 3 separate teams. The projects aren't too hard either, but time consuming and the content is boring. I was expecting a follow up to 6300 which I enjoyed. Instead, I, like many others, just dropped this course. For what it's worth, my grades on all assignments were at or above the median, so this isn't sour grapes. Just a terrible class. Note: There's also a 'class participation' component, based on Piazza. As students pointed out, this leads to a lot of noise on the forums and makes them even harder to glean important information from than it already would be.  Agree with the anonymous poster 2 spots above me. Everything is in group projects so at any given time there are at least 2 groups you need to be keeping track with. Which is extremely annoying. The content isn't difficult, the structure of the course is what makes this course difficult. If I didn't have to rely on other team members, I feel like I would be doing much better in the class. This is my first semester, but this is also the worst class I have ever taken. I have an undergrad in CS. I can't tell you how much I despise this class. The content is extremely boring and outdated. I was hoping to learn more code architecture in this class, but instead I'm learning how to create diagrams that I've never had to use as a software developer for the last 8 years. Very dissappointed.  I'm currently in the class and doing well, but am disappointed with the class in general. I feel like I've learned very little yet expended quite a bit of work and effort. Working with many random teams across different time zones can be problematic. Often people drop class or simply don't contribute their fair share to the team. The material itself seems boring and dated to me. I suspect there are some jobs that would make use of the different items that are covered, but I've only seen a handful of them used in my working experience.  Terrible class. Lectures are long, uninteresting and basically consist of a bunch of common sense that doesn't make sense. Assignments (which contribute only ~2% each to the course grade) are usually a 7 page paper and are group based and due a week after being assigned. There are 3 projects (each contributes 15% to the course grade) and you are assigned to a different group for each. Each project has 2 10 page papers plus the Java code for the project. There is no limit to the minutiae of detail on what is expected on each assignment and project. This might be considered a good thing, but it really isn't when the detail on the project changes during the course of the project and the format required on the papers isn't consistent with what the grading criteria are. Grades on the assignments and projects are not returned in a timely manner (they can't be given how involved the projects and assignments have to be). And even after the assignment or project is complete we have no idea of what would have received a 100% (no exemplars or even a diagram that works) - so how can we learn what to do better? Numerous classmates dropped the course which makes project completion even more difficult. \n\nSummary: Very time consuming and difficult - BY DESIGN.  Random -- in a nutshell. Awkward course design. Too much emphasis on group projects with random team members; subjective participation criteria (15% of the grade); unclear expectations.  Enjoy this course a lot. I was happy that I was able to learn the different architectures and actually put them in play This is a good course for someone from a non-CS background or has little experience in architecture and design. The UML coverage overlaps a little with SDP 6300, but expands beyond that.\nThe early assignments were good. The professor held ~weekly \"reading discussions\" to discuss research papers, which I found very helpful. Most of the reading assignments were very interesting also.\nThe group project felt like just another group project. It had some design aspects, but little to reinforce the architecture component of the course. There were 6 assignments (4 individual and 2 group). Your overall grade is based on these assignments and class participation (completing all quizzes and actively on piazza). I took a Software Design course during my undergrad and as expected this went more in depth than my undergrad but not as much as one would think. The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester. \n\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester: \n\n1. Feedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza. \n\n2. Grading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class. \n\n3. I found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design. SAD is a good course and gives an overall basic knowledge of software architecture and design aspects and principles. If you are new to architecture and design it's a good learning and if you have already worked in the software development and design for few years this will be a refresher course. This course was well structured and took you through the iterative design and implementation process that you might experience working as a small consultancy. You start on your own then move into group work. The class was all project based which I prefer. Grading could be slow but overall I enjoyed this class. I agree with most of the other comments, but would add that the three projects are poorly considered, poorly specified and consume a lot of time unrelated to software design. The instructor attempts at clarification added to the confusion as often as not. My summary: the course is a huge amount of work inefficiently applied to sofware design topics that would have been state of the art in 1994.  Very poor ROI in this class. A lot of effort for very little value. If you have been in inudstry for a few years and already know the basics of architecture and design, don't take this class. Majortiy of the content isn't relevant, is just common sense, or something you can learn in a few minutes on the net. All topics are covered briefly. More time should be decidicated to the most relelvant topics. All the team-based assignments and projects can be frustrating especially when team members drop in the middle of a project. This creates hell for the other team members. And unfortunately, team members dropping the class is common due to all the items above.  If you like skeet shooting, take this class because the project instructions are a moving target. This is not a physics course, however much of the development time on the projects will be devoted to figuring out how to model heat diffusion. The instructor should provide code or a jar file that can be used to perform these arbitrary calcualtions so that the students can focus on the real goals of the projects which should be learning how to architect and design a system. The instructor expects perfect papers, yet his course material is riddled with errors. There is even a dedicated place on the class forums to report these 'bugs. ' The only positive aspect of this is that it counts for class participation. I found many of the problems I reported just by copying the instructions and doing a spell check in Word. I know of 2 students who dropped other courses and one who withdrew from school because of this class. If you take it, be ready for a roller coaster ride. I never realized how much stress and anxiety can produce physical symptoms until I went to the doctor and she said I was likely experiencing a rapid heart beat and night sweats because of this class. The best thing about the whole experience is that now I have a profound respect for those people who deal with panic attacks on a daily basis. Worst class I've ever taken. Constantly made me consider dropping out of school. I almost think he made it this hard on purpose so it can be a 'weeder' class. I can just imagine him leaning back in his office chair and grinning as the negative feedback surveys come rolling in. Despite all of this, if you have to take it, try not to stress too much becasue I think (hope) most students will end up with an A or B regardless of the actual grades. See his 'grading philosophy' at https://www. udacity. com/wiki/saad/faq. One other positive... It has given me a greater appreciation of my free time because there are weeks on end where you have practically none.  Some of the grading seemed arbitrary, but it's a great overview of the topic.  Disconnect between the older lectures and the newer approach in the readings and office hours/discussion.  Group project was really good, and a good way to get to know others in the program well. One of the easiest courses in OMSCS. Projects are easy but time consuming. The last project which is worth 20% of the grade was a code based implementation group project which needs to be tightly managed as team members are all over the world and have different experiences. The subject matter of this course is not difficult at all if you are a java software engineer. That said, the workload of this course can be deceptive. There are some assignments that don't take much time but there are others that do if you want to get top marks. If your goal is to get the highest grade possible then be prepared to put some time into this course but if all you want to do is pass then this course probably won't require too much. This is grad school so at the end of the day you get out what you put in.  Though it was stressful at time, overall I liked this course. Professor and TA's were very responsive on the Piazza forms, though they were at time slow on returning assignment and project grades as well as updating mistakes in the grading. \n\nOverall the workload depended on the week. When there were no projects released or assignments due, I would typically spend only a few hours a week. When a project was due, I would spend closer to 20 hours a week. I would recommend starting on projects when they are released, as if you do not, you will end up having to pull some late nights. The lectures were informative, but really did not cover what you needed to do on projects and assignments in great detail, though I think the professor's point that you cannot teach design through lectures is valid. \n\nThe one thing I really did not like about the course was the choice of technologies we had to work with. The projects involved implementing a tool called Gurobi, which is very poorly documented, and very hard to work with unless you understand what you are doing. For the first project especially, I spent at least 75% of my time trying to get Gurobi to work and 25% actually focusing on what the course teaches.  I liked as a first course, not too many hours per week. I ended up spending more time since I had to review the course content more than once partly due to work. However its easy and with the timelines you could make it. Important is the 200 point project, if your team is good you're good. Make sure you spend sometime learning the UML concepts, they will be used throughout. Decent course. Course involved one group project when I took it, which took a ton of work due to other students not pulling their weight. Otherwise, class was interesting and I learned a decent amount. I was part of the Spring 2016 class as well, overall I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot. This class was overall not difficult in terms of the content that was taught. However, the programming projects were a bit more difficult and extremely time consuming, thus the reason for my higher average workload feedback. Mark Moss was a very good professor. He attended all office hours together with the TA's. TA's were also very responsive on Piazza as well, so support was easy to get if you asked for it. Projects were all java based which was nice because my Java background is lacking, so I was able to learn a new programming language as a result. In terms of project details, the first project was not team based and required decent knowledge of optimization concepts and the use of the Gurobi optimization framework. So you would be wise to brush up on Linear Programming optimization. Projects 2 & 3 were team based and as someone else mentioned on a different review, if you have a strong team, you will love this course! We had a diverse set of skills that allowed us to get very good grades on the projects, in addition to coming up with really cool designs and implementations. For our last project, we pretty much designed a full web based distributed application that utilized Vaadin (web gui), Spring (MVC framework), and the Gurobi optimizer. These are all technologies that I believe are used in the real world so I believe I can really apply what I have learned.  This course ended up being much more time consuming than I had originally expected. A normal week I probably spent about 10 hours, but weeks in which projects were due it was more around 20-25 hours. The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice. I did learn a lot about the subject and thought it was well presented. That being said, I do have two major gripes about this course:\n\n1. Feedback and Grades. I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn't have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know. \n\n2. Group projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience. I honestly would have been better off doing it all myself. Keep this in mind if you take this course!\n\nOverall I give this course a 4/5. I enjoyed the material and learned a lot about software architecture and design. While time consuming, I enjoyed the class. Just learn from my naivety and be careful when selecting a group The material was pretty straightforward, especially if you've had any experience working for a large organization. Some of the stuff was a little tedious to implement. Additionally, the workload increased dramatically toward the end of the semester with implementation stages and team projects. Very good course with a lot of material to learn. It can easily be thought as two consecutive courses in order to spend adequate time on all topics. I loved the videos and the reading materials. Most emphasis is on UML class diagrams and state charts. The design patterns are covered but it deserves more emphasis as it seems to be a hot topic these days. You need to know Java to do the projects. This class was fun and I enjoyed it. However, my experience was probably due to the amazing team I had to work with. Almost everything is team based. The projects are big and hard, but no too hard if you have a good team. There are several weeks where you need to be working on your big project, but they assign you a research paper to do at the same time. They aren't big, but almost seemed irrelevant, like a side nuisance in the grand scheme of the projects. Plan to spend lots of time on big projects and get yourself a good team right from the start. It will make this class much much easier.  The Course is OK. However, the response from TA and instructor is relative slow. Sometimes, we would not get feedback from them 3 weeks after submission. In my opinion, the course material needs an updated for more design pattern coverage. This was my first class, and it was a good introduction to the program. Not too difficult, some projects to help get you into the flow of school again (for those of us who last attended school ages ago). The group project was the hardest part, mainly because of getting everyone on the same page and being able to do the requirements on time (there was a lot of wasted time on our part organizing and scheduling). I highly recommend when you get a new project to start right away as they projects always seemed to take longer then one would expect.   The course had really good TAs, they were active on Piazza. One thing that got me was the first java assignment, they were very finicky about your program's output matching the expected answers. Make sure you match the expected answers 100% (keep running diff commands). Make sure you familiarize yourself with UML diagrams, state charts and OOP design patterns and you'll get an A. The grades come back kind of slowly, but as long as you break the problem down and model it correctly you won't have any issues. The video lectures are good, actually pretty funny because of the professor's interactions with the udacity person. This is for sure a first course to get you in the swing of the program. \n\nUse lucidchart for your diagrams, it's ezpz. This course is very strange, and I was very disappointed from its offering and content. \n\ndownside:\nOther then that, this is a total waste of time. The lectures are super boring and outdated (too much in high level) and not relevant for 2016 - you we feel like you are 15 years back in time - This is a shame. \nThe assignment are very general and will not provide you any added value. \nThe course is not being organize and it feel like lectures, projects and assignments that have nothing to do to each other, and 80% of the content will need help you in your career. \n\nupside:\nYou can learn a lot from the projects, but I do not think that they were managed and specified poorly. \n\nBe prepare for lot's of hours being spent on the projects.  Big disconnect between video lessons, reading discussions and assignments. Probably, in part, due to the fact the professor changed from the the time the video content was created.  I thought a disproportional emphasis was put into UML versus SW architecture and design topics. Group project towards the end of the semester is interesting, but if you find yourself in a bad team you may be in trouble as the team project accounts for 20% of your entire grade. Also on grading, it took the teaching body a long time to grade assignments, which can be a problem as, since some of the assignments sort of build on each other, if you make mistakes on an early assignment, you may get penalized for the same mistake on a later assignment. However, grading seemed very reasonable and methodical overall. It was my first course on the program, and one I thought to be a good intro to it after the fact. Probably worth taking it, but don't expect much learning if you work as a SW engineer on your day job; however, as others already alluded to, it is a Graduate course and you get what you put in.  Good course. Definitely applicable to most work places. Good experience with the team project. The assignments that require drawing (diagrams and so) took me a very long time to complete. Not a hard course, but very time consuming. ", 
    "CS-6340": " The class took a total U turn after midterms. The assignments before midterm were fun and were about topics that could be used practically like automatic unit test code generation, random testing etc. The midterms were open book but took many by surprise and it resulted in very low mean and median scores. The class also had a month long break after midterms were nothing was due. \n\nThe last two assignments were crazy difficult and people struggled a lot. There was not much help from the instructors and the Piazza forum was ran by only handful of students. The software analysis tool used was the one developed by the professor and it had limited documentation and no practical value unless you are into system programming, IDE development, Compiler design etc. \n\nSoftware Test part of this course is good and has some practical use. Software Analysis is good to know and is explained well but not applicable to everyone. \n\nIf you are just looking to add one course to complete the course requirements, stay away from it. If you are not specializing in systems, stay away from it.  This class is hard... BUT... it is fair and passable.\nThe exams require quite a bit of preparation and study (I studied at least 40 hours for Midterm, 25 hours for Final, and my grades reflected it [83% midterm, 74% final]), and are timed, but there is ample time given. The assignments require multiple languages, C++ (this was one assignment, and my first time with C++, and got 100%), Java, Python, Shell-scripting, etc., and using unique tools to convey the concepts in the class. The resources are excellent, test prep, pdfs of lectures, office hours are unmatched in quality of information. The Instructors are continually making improvements, and I've personally witnessed some, (I attempted class twice). The instructors are a class act, with plenty of communication, and always making sure students are given the tools needed to be prepared week to week.\nWhile I did not ace this class, and would not want to re-take, I wouldn't change the fact that I took it. I did learn quite a bit, and will end up using the concepts in my day to day job.\nJust don't think you'll skate by, without putting in the effort.\nAnd If you take this next semester, I'm sure it will be improved, knowing these instructors. Warning about previous reviews: I found many of the claims in previous reviews to be INACCURATE: that the exams didn't test student's understanding, that the exams didn't look like the practice exams, that the assignments lacked specifics, that the lectures didn't help with the assignments, or that the documentations of libraries/frameworks/tools for the assignments were lacking. \n\nThe exams and assignments' questions were among the best quality in all of the classes that I've taken so far. Mid-term and final exams tested concepts from the lectures, were straightforward and fair. There were no trick questions. If you paid attention during lectures, took notes, and spent the time to understand the concepts, you would do exceedingly well (I scored in the 90%s for both mid-term and final; it can be done!). In fact, for a couple questions in the final exam, the answers were directly in the lecture notes, and so you could literally just copy and paste!\n\nThe lectures were excellent and provided all of the (basic) fundamentals to work on the assignments, and you would fill in any gaps by reading the required readings mentioned in the assignment instructions. Again, if you took notes during lectures, and did the readings, then the assignments would feel straightforward. This doesn't mean that they were easy, but at least you wouldn't get entangled in the concepts, and would instead be able to tackle the \"puzzle\" head on. The documentations on the libraries/frameworks/tools were sufficient and clear. \n\nIn summary, this is an excellent class on static and dynamic analyses. In addition to the application, it covers theoretical aspects: does an analysis terminate; is it complete; is it sound; can we do better, and if so, what the trade-offs would be? You will learn a ton, and end up with a deeper appreciation of static/dynamic analyses--the sort of things compilers and IDEs do to optimize/analyze your code. Also, Dr. Pryby and the TAs were responsive, fair, helpful, and awesome. I'm writing my review near the end of the summer semester, with only one assignment and a final left to go. From reading some of the other reviews I am wondering if this course was changed after last semester. I do not find it anywhere near as hard as some reviews have indicated. \n\nI've been able to get by with about 3-4 hours per week of total time, during the summer session, and have a very good grade so far. The TAs have posted statistics and the median grade of the rest of the class is also very strong. I believe the midterm average was around an 80%. \n\nThe material and assignments are interesting. I'd actually appreciate a slightly deeper dive into some of the areas, rather than the pretty quick surface study that is given in the lectures. That said, the lectures are good, and there is nothing stoping students from researching more on their own. \n\nThe Prof has been mostly absent from piazza all semester, but the team of TAs have done an excellent job grading and responding to posts in a timely manor. I did not attend any office hours so cannot comment on them directly, but based on many posts I saw on the forum I gather the office hours were helpful for those that needed it.  I felt this was the worse class I have taken thus far. \n\nFirst the positives: Michael and Ben ran the class and did a good job keeping up with needs as well as having office hours. They attempted to be fair for the most part and I appreciate their efforts. \n\nNow for the negatives. First problem, completely non-existent professor. He never showed up once and coming from a class last semester where the professor was heavily involved this was a let down. The videos were also weak in a number of areas where complicated concepts were glossed over and never really explained in great detail leaving the TAs to have to try and explain these concepts. The class also seemed to have copied in large part the material from a Stanford course CS295. Some of the assignments for example were taken word for word from the Stanford assignments. Luckily some of the videos from Stanford explain the material way better. I find this really disgusting considering we are always asked not to plagiarize. \n\nOverall the material was not what I was expecting. A number of assignments used libraries with little or no documentation that was often times inaccurate or was utilizing libraries on projects that had been abandoned years before. I really think this class could be better described as to what it is covering and better if some of the more useless aspects were removed. There was some good material but it was mostly hidden away behind all the useless items I had to learn about. 20% Midterm\n25% Final\n50% Assignments (8)\n5% Participation\n\nJust took the midterm, which was proctored (ProctorTrak). It was open notes, where you could view slides with a PDF viewer. The questions mirrored the quizzes in the lectures. Exam format was multiple-choice, multiple-select, free-response. \n\nThe pace is approximately 1 lecture per week with 1 assignment every 1-2 weeks. \n\nAssignments so far have paralleled the lecture topics, covering Dafny, Korat, Randoop, Statistical Debugging, Delta Debugging, and Dataflow Analysis. They are interesting and graded pretty quickly. \n\nThe instructor is excellent and very active in Piazza. The material is very relevant. Highly recommend.  I took this course with the thought that it would be about software testing techniques at the source code level. Although the first few lectures covered that material, the course then proceeded toward compiler-level analysis of source code. This was not what I was expecting/wanting from this course; I previewed the remaining course materials and decided that this course wasn't really going to be applicable to my interests/career. I've decided to withdraw from the course. I'd say that this course is more oriented toward OMSCS students whose background is in CS and compilers rather than a software engineering type. I thought the lecture material was fairly dry, and failed to provide much context for the concepts and algorithms being presented. I completed the first 3 assignments and felt that they were somewhat useful in reinforcing the concepts taught in lecture, but I spent most of the time trying to read the (generally sparse) documentation for the tool. This summer (2017), the instructors provided excellent midterm preparation material for the midterm exam, but the exam was still challenging (took me 2 hours to complete of the 3-hour window). I thought the grading was strangely harsh for some relatively minor errors (my opinion) in homework submissions. \n\nI feel like the course kind of hangs you out to dry on the assignments in terms of support. The lectures cover the concepts, but the assignments are basically \"Read the manual for this tool, and implement stuff. \" I've taken enough well scaffolded courses to know that this is not the best way to teach people (throwing them into the deep end). \n\nTL;DR: Overall, I was disappointed in the content of the course, since it didn't really focus much on software testing but mostly low-level analysis most suited for compilers. If you're into that type of thing, this course may be for you. I ended up withdrawing from the course for these reasons. First of all, this is a mid sem review by request so poke me if I don't update after... \n\nThis class is a very interesting and a ton of fun! It can be frustrating and the projects range from very easy to medium, but no where near as hard as IOS for example. This was the first sem of the class, so there are some bugs to work out, interesting wording, etc. The office hours haven't been great, but that is my only complaint so far. You do not need to be running native linux as the course description might suggest. I didn't need my Ubuntu VM (same one I used for IOS) until the 5th assignment and some students got it working in Windows I think. The lectures are well done and interesting. I highly recommend this course! (so far)\n\nIt doesn't hurt to know a little C and Java before the course, otherwise it isn't a bad beginner course. \n\nAssignments are all individual.  This was a very tough class, but there were both pros and cons. \n\nAssignments - aside from the last assignment (which i simply couldn't complete even after ~40 hours), they were all very well done and a bit fun. Some take an insane amount of time to complete, while others are very easy. The overall balance felt about right for the assignments. \n\nUdacity - Some lectures were better than others, but the quizzes in them were excellent. They really helped you learn the material. Very well thought out and the best quizzes out of any class I've taken. \n\nExams - horrendous. Absolutely did not test our knoweldge of the material whatsoever. Questions came out of complete left field and I feel are more ego-driven to show off how smart the professor is and his vast amount of knoweldge outside of Software testing than to actually test us on what we know. I failed the final and got a D on the midterm. But then again, the median grade for each was in the D/F range -- this alone speaks volumes. \n\nTime spent - This is hard to calculate, as some weeks were 40 hours, and then there were stretches of time where there was no work whatsoever. It fluctuates a lot, but I would say each assignment is 10-15 hours on average, and there were 8 assignments. \n\nA word of warning - this professor is absolutely obsessed with finding and punishing people who copy or reference code from other students or past classes. Multiple announcements were made throughout the semester, warning students of getting an F in the class and using heavy threats demanding \"they know who cheated, but if the student turns themselves in the punishment will be far less severe. \" The constant threats were irritating and seemed to really negatively affect student morale, especially the honest ones. This was very unprofessional and should have been handled discretely without obnoxiously threatening the entire class. \n\nAll in all. It was a solid class with a good amount of work. Grading was generous, even with the impossible exams.  This class requires you to setup and use many tools on your workstation and/or a VM. For Windows users, the setup I recommend is as follows in the host OS: (1) Visual Studio Community Edition (or higher) with Dafny extension, (2) JDK 1. 8, and (3) Android SDK. Then, create a Ubuntu VM with the following: (1) JDK 1. 7. Yes this is a lot of tools and you will need them all :)\n\nThe assignments are for the most part pretty interesting! There is usually a \"trick\" involved and once you figured it out things will just click. However, plan on some extra time for the static analysis assignments towards the end of the class. Some of the students spent hours and hours on the last assignment, (Constraint Based Analysis), and the solution is surprisingly concise at about 20 lines of code. \n\nThe midterm and final were pretty difficult. On the midterm there was a generous curve and the instructors said that there will be a similar one for the final. The material comes from the lectures and is expanded upon. I would recommend watching each lecture twice; once before doing the corresponding homework and once before the test. Also, plan on re-taking quizzes using pencil and paper when watching for the second time (since you can't blank out previous submissions on Udacity).  Background knowledge:  Do not be fooled by the supposed required background knowledge.  They said we needed to be \"familiar\" with \"a high level programming language like Java or C++).  For your own health and safety, do not attempt this class without a very solid foundation in BOTH Java and C++, and experience in C and Bash scripting would definitely help to have in advance.  I went in not knowing C++ and we ended up having an assignment written in that language with a special framework that I got a 30 on because I had to spend so much time just trying to figure out the language and the corresponding special framework that I barely got around to actually figuring out the concept behind the assignment.  Don't make my mistakes.\n\nClass material:  There were definitely some interesting and useful concepts sprinkled in, but I work in this field and had never heard of most of the concepts/testing techniques in this class.  Either my company is just really terrible at testing, or a lot of these techniques are outdated, far too specific, or not used in the actual business world, and I think it's the latter.  There was some material that was very useful, but many of the lectures were incredibly boring and slow-moving.  Lots of time was spent on background and not as much on the actual concepts.\n\nAssignments:  This is what killed the class for me.  Assignments were either ridiculously easy (an hour or two) or impossibly difficult (30+ hours, and the majority were like this).  There were 7 total and I came to dread each release of a new assignment.  For me, they felt like an enormous leap from the lectures and I felt completely lost for the first third of the time spent on the tough ones.  Provided resources were extremely limited and lacked detail, and the concepts nearly always couldn't be found anywhere on the web, so I had to rely on asking the other students and TAs on Piazza for everything I couldn't understand, which was frustrating.  Overall the assignments tested our ability to figure out what we are supposed to do with the tiniest scraps of information as possible rather than our understanding of the concepts from class, so they felt like a huge and infuriating waste of time.\n\nExams:  The midterm was tough but I felt it was pretty fair.  We were given a practice exam for both the midterm and final and I felt the practice gave a good feel for what the real exam is like.  The class average was a 65 on the midterm, but the grades were curved soon afterwards.  The exams are open-lecture notes.  \n\nProfessors/TAs:  One of our professors was very dedicated, consistent with office hours, and was always on Piazza helping out and answering questions.  The other professor who recorded the lectures showed up for one office hours, which were supposed to be weekly, and then cancelled each week after that before finally not scheduling them at all and being replaced by rotating TAs.  The TAs were helpful and seemed dedicated to helping the students, and they seem like they had to carry a lot of the weight, so I commend them for that.\n\nThis was my first class in the entire program and it had me questioning whether the program was right for me.  I am hoping I will have a better experience in other classes.  Overall, I can't necessarily recommend the class but if you are better prepared (see section 1 of my review) you will probably suffer much less than I did. This was my first class in OMSCS. I found it very exciting and very useful. There were 2 exams both were very tough ones. It was easy to lose marks. We could easily get about 55%. But after that it would be difficult. Assignment were tricky connects with the lessons we learn. We need to pay 100% attention to every word that was written in the lecture notes. There were 7 assignments. All were worth doing. Subject covered pretty broad spectrum of Software Testing and Analysis methods and approaches with more emphasis on compiler and Visual Studio's testing. Some of the tools I got introduced to were never heard before. Couple of those assignments were very tough. It took almost weekends to get them worked. Overall it enabled me to think in a much broader sense. I really felt the challenge of computer science subject. Overall, I felt very good about the course, although I did not fare very well. I'm one of the survivors of this course. I'm going to try to be unbiased as possible. \n1. The lectures: topics covered in this course are interesting. They don't teach you on how to use testing tools out there in the market, instead, they teach you the techniques behind those tools. Lectures are very short, with few easy examples. Most quizzes are hard to crack. You suppose to infer the answers out of the poor explanation of the concepts. In most of the lectures, the lecturer only repeats what's on the slides word by word not explaining much of the concepts. You don't have supporting materials. If you google it, it's hard to find the concepts covered in lectures. There are only few external references. \n2. The assignments: what is hard about them is not what you have to accomplish, but instead trying to figure out the tools and topics under you have to perform. Topics like graph theory, pseudo machine code are necessary. You have to use deprecated tools that are uncommon in real life. It's hard to find documentation. You have to spend hours in learning those topics and tools before attempting to solve the assignments. The time slot is fair. Most of them have the expected output. Piazza is a great tool, and office hours help you a lot. \n3. The exams: they are open-notes. So, it doesn't not matter how many times you review the lectures, or do the quizzes or the practice exams, it will not help you at all. Exams are very hard. It is expected that you master the topics that were barely covered in lectures and apply that knowledge to unrealistic situations or algorithms. The mean for the midterm was a 32/50. You do the math. \n4. TA's are very active and very friendly, professor only showed up a couple of times in office hours. \nIn conclusion, it's a hard class because of the way it is taught, barely covering topics and expecting from you to become an expert. Be careful if you are going to take this course. This is one of the best courses I have taken in the OMSCS. I would put the difficulty somewhere between easy and medium, depending on your previous experiences and knowledge. \n\nThe assignments are interesting, they align well with the lectures, and more than enough time is provided. All assignments had 1-2 weeks to complete and I was able to get most done in ~ 2 days (and I have very little experience in Java). \n\nThe exams are more than fair: first, provided practice exams do well to prepare students for the actual exam; second, the exams are open-notes; finally, there is nothing tricky about the exams and the questions were entirely reasonable. Follow the lectures, take some of your own notes, keep a copy of the instructor notes handy, and run through the practice exam, and you should have no trouble with the midterm/final in this course. Study for the exams earlier rather than later. The instructors (rightfully, IMO) do not answer questions about course content during the exam window, so if you wait to start studying until after the exam has opened, you may find yourself unable to get help if you're stuck. \n\nFinally, the instructors/TAs for this course were excellent. They were readily available to assist students, from Piazza to Slack to Office hours. They were courteous and respectful to students, extremely fast with grade turnarounds, and overall ran the course better than just about any class I've taken so far. No mid-assignment revisions, no absurd grading policies, no \"gotchas\". I think that of all the courses that I have taken in the OMSCS program this is the one that I disliked the most. The course material presented did not prepare you in any way for the mid term. The material was informative to an extent but could be much more useful. The TAs seems to not be very helpful as well. Now that may have changed now. All in all I think that they need to take a look at this course and determine if it is something that they would like to teach at all. If it is something that they could teach maybe it could be updated to maybe at least follow a single textbook. In short: I don\u2019t recommend taking this class. \n\nPlease feel free to refer to Udacity videos or Piazza to verify my comments if you like. I tried my best to be fair & hopefully it helps others. I got a B in this class. \n\nContent: Videos are highly analytic & professor often uses \u201cso\u201d & \u201ctherefore\u201d to skip explaining a concept. I took this class under the impression that it\u2019s related to the standard testing/QA but it was mostly about compiler design/efficiency. Video lectures quality is overall low especially towards the end. \nPre-requisites: Pre-reqs were removed from the course page later on. You need to be proficient in Java, C, discrete math \u2026\nExams: I\u2019ll summarize it with this epic story: Instructor posted a pdf with sample questions prior to the midterm & based on the comments on Piazza, majority of the class simply thought that he posted the wrong pdf or in the wrong class. Average for the midterm exam was in mid-50. Hopefully you can understand the gap here\nAssignments: They are written in a very dense academic format. Professor & the TAs weren\u2019t helpful in explaining the assignment, providing resources or answering Piazza questions. They run a plagiarism program over all the assignments & you can end up at the dean office or get an F if they find you plagiarized. \nPiazza: Professor & TAs are very detached from Piazza but you see lots of helpful comment from the top 5% of the class. Anon post are not allowed. \nProfessor/TA: In a nutshell I think I\u2019d have enjoyed this class a lot more if we had an active/engaged, professional & experienced professor. The staff was not open to any suggestion or feedback. I felt they were very much used to the on-campus traditional style of teaching & communication with students. Professor Mayur only showed up to say the harsh words or threaten students. Before finals week he sent a mass email saying: \u201cI find that you plagiarized in this assignment while grading, the consequences will be severe: an F grade in this entire course. \u201d Really interesting class - it does a good job of balancing practical and theoretical aspects of software analysis, and covers some very interesting tools and techniques. The videos are very well done, and explain the concepts well. \n\nIt suffers from some pacing issues - it switches from being very busy to having nothing to do for a few weeks - but I'm attributing that more to it being the first offering of the class. \n\nRecommended.  This class is exemplary of Tech. I was an undergrad here. Trust me, I would know. \n\n\"You will use my outdated Java API and it will suck your soul out. \"\n\"But sir, there're at least 5 libraries that do what yours does and are actually maintained... \"\n\"You will use my API. \"\n\"But sir... \"\n\"Welcome to Tech. \"\n\"Ok\"\n\n\"Ok\": the 4 year cliffhanger and counting. In all seriousness though, this class actually manages to decimate intellectual curiousity... and for that I suppose a round of applause is in order. \n\nEdit: Mod I understand you stripping out ad hominem but please don't go all social justice warrior on my post or remove bits that are part of the argument. Really when you think about it, the fact that so many professors at this school are self ingratiated is actually part of the reason why classes like this, that are so poor and devolved from reality, exist in the first place There are some interesting concepts and tools introduced in this class about testing and debugging, but there are lots of cryptic academic only notation and syntax, and definitions that seem custom to the class. The videos are very light on information and it was absolutely necessary to watch office hours and review piazza since there was a lot left out. Grading makes this class relatively simple since most of the grade is based on the projects, but the tests are vary hard. The tests seem to cover topics that are either barely covered in the videos, or combinations of topics that we are expected to figure out on our own.  Automated Testing, Statistical Debugging, Datalog. Here's a testing program using java 1. 7 with terrible documentation written in sanskrit. Five of the assignments are easy. Two will destroy you. Check out chord. jar and Datalog before taking the class. They changed the course this semester to put the 2 hard ones in the middle of the semester, and every assignment after was so easy, I thought I was completely missing part of the assignment. The theories and ideas are good, some of the tools used are old. The assignments and lectures are very informative and interesting. However, the mid-term was very tough. Coupled with the horrible interface of proctortrack and the questions, many of which were not covered in the lectures and the limited time given for the test will result in a bad score for me at least. Professor said he will grade leniently. We also have a comprehensive final which I am not looking forward to. The exams in total make up 45% of your grade.  This is a fun and great course. I'm happy to see more and more courses going online so that OMSer's have more choices. I don't come from a CS background and took this course mostly for curiosity and the fun of puzzle solving. It's eye opening to see so many techniques, each with their own benefits and trade-offs. The lectures are not the most entertaining ones, but the organization is very good and I had no trouble following through. The assignments and exams focus heavily on application of concepts and problem solving. \n\nEach assignment involves reading the documentation on your own. It sounds intimidating but once you get your hands dirty with some examples, the problems aren't impossible. You can even get away with reading minimal amount of documentation. I'm not sure if the tools you learn in the assignments will be used in your future career, but they do serve the purpose of helping you learn. You'll need some knowledge about Java and at least be able to debug pointer related errors. The exams are difficult but open notes. It involves some tricks and a lot of thinking. \n\nRegarding plagiarism, the solution as simple as \"don't do it\". There's no need to worry that your one-sentence code will most likely be the same as someone else'. The teaching staff know well enough about software testing to avoid false positives. Anti-plagiarism is not your enemy unless you are happy to graduate with students who cheat their way.  Overall the class covers some neat topics. Assignments are directly related to the lectures and utilizes the tools discussed in the lectures. In fact, some of what we've done I would like to see used in my job. \n\nAssignments aren't too difficult and aren't too time consuming. Some will require extra reading but overall they should only take a few hours to finish. Exams were difficult, in part due to the exam format. ProctorTrack did make some updates for the final but the format still was kind of wonky (making table with text is kind of hard, long questions were in a scrollable box so you had to keep scrolling back and forth to get the full picture). There wasn't anything in the exam that wasn't covered in the lectures, you just need to make sure you have a real understanding of the lecture material and really understand the solutions to the lecture quizzes. \n\nThere are some pacing problems, but that will likely be improved in future iterations of the course. Up to the midterm there's something to do every week, but after there's not much material left to cover.  Content - The Udacity videos did a good job of presenting the course information. They presented the information in a pretty traditional, straightforward way (as opposed to the \"socratic\" approach of a class like ML), but they were sufficient. The quizzes embedded in the lectures were well-designed and more than just a trivial \"pick the right answer\". \n\nProjects - Favorite part of the class. Each project gave us a chance to use a tool in order to get hands-on experience with a topic covered in the lectures. Most of these tools required (or recommended) Linux in order to get consistent results. It would have been nice to start with a standard VM image, but it's also not difficult to set one up yourself. Regardless -- the projects were well-designed, relevant to the lectures, interesting, and most of all -- fun!\n\nExams - Both exams were open-notes. You could even use PDFs on your computer during the exam. Therefore, the questions on the exams required less rote memorization and more active application of the concepts learned. From what I've heard, most of the students that had trouble with the exams actually struggled more with ProctorTrack than anything else. That's unfortunate, but not really a knock on the exams themselves. The questions were fair and did a good job evaluating comprehension of the material. \n\nAdministration - The TAs and the professor were very active and helpful on Piazza. This is not necessarily always the case in other OMSCS classes, so it was definitely appreciated here. Most of the grading was done in a timely fashion, although a few of the assignments took longer than average. \n\nOverall - This class is an overview class -- you'll cover a lot of different topics, without going too far in-depth. The class is similar to CS 6035 in that regard. You'll get exposed to a lot of interesting ideas and use a variety of tools to explore those ideas, which hopefully encourage you to learn more in the future. I highly recommend this course.   the class leverages out of data technology for the assignments making it very difficult and time spent on those projects. Secondly there is not enough readings for the lecture material and the lectures are very lacking. Wasn't a fan of the material in this class. Also the exams are very challenging. this class would be best suited if it updated to newer technology and provides a good book. Personal Background: Completed undergraduate degree in computer engineering in December 2014 with minimal CS training in Java, C, and C++ in basic concepts as part of degree. Worked as an electrical engineer in power distribution between now and then. Full-time online student currently. No formal software analysis and test training in academic or work environment. This was one of two courses that I took in my first semester. \n\nCourse Experience: Overall, the course was worthwhile from my personal background. The instructors and TAs are truly excellent in operating the course and helping the students understand the material. The assignments are very effective in teaching concepts and new tools. All horror assignments alluded to in previous semesters have been removed. Some tools were specific to academic research and not necessarily widely used in industry, which may not be beneficial for some students. Everyone had to fight through the difficulty of obscure environments and languages. I had an abnormally large and painful learning curve for most assignments due to my deficient background, hence the 25 hours a week. Five different languages used throughout assignments, but I was able to figure out the appropriate usage of each given enough time. Once you endure through the learning curve, you realize the simplicity of the coding for all but one assignment that required a specific algorithm that I hadn't implemented before. The concepts and analyses are relevant as well. The exams require application of the knowledge rather than simple memorization. For example, given this type of analysis, find the output of the given simple code rather than recite the definition and characteristics of an analysis. I gave a \"liked\" rating as the lessons I learned on the assignments and exams were truly valuable but often cost me 20% or more on my grade, which can be a difference in a letter grade. Then again, one should have to earn an A.  Full disclosure, I have no idea if I'm passing this course with a B or not, so I may not even get credit for taking it. Despite that, I learned a lot in this course. I'd even go as far as to say that this course actually prepared me for a separate assignment in another course which helped me apply what I was learning while taking this one. As a qualification, I am of the student build that didn't come with a complete CS background, instead having a degree in IT with an emphasis in programming. However at time of taking this course I have never taken a traditional algorithm and data structure course which the class expects you to come with some knowledge. \n\nThe course surveys different testing tools and ways of deriving analysis. It requires a lot of exploration and research on the student's part which I think is largely why there are many negative reviews because in many instances you were stuck reading through pages of a specific API in order to complete one part of the assignment. For me at least I can say that this has largely made me a better programmer though it feels like a trial by fire. We had a pretty active piazza environment so I was able to make some pretty good strides. However, be aware that the instructor is a stickler for plagiarism, so absolutely it is to your benefit to write your own code by yourself. \n\nThe tests are open book, but it doesn't really help because it will be based more on your ability to apply the knowledge to problems. \n\nClosing statements, this was the first iteration of the course online so there were a couple of speed bumps. I expect that the course will get better with time.  one of the worst course I have ever taken. Both professor and TAs were disinclined to help students with very less participation and clarification. I doubt if I will ever use topics learnt in this course in my professional career. regret taking this course after putting so much of effort and time.\n Grading of the assignments and exams is not to test the student's understanding of the material, but to somehow make the students drop the course. The assignment questions are much advanced from what is being taught in the lectures and there is few material provided with the intention to teach what the students are supposed to understand from the course. This course goes against the ethics of teaching itself. I fared well in certain assignments because I already had thorough understanding of the matter under test, which I had gained from my own previous work experience. \n\nThe outdated APIs used for some assignments themselves need much workload to decipher, which will not find much practical use in a real-life scenario. Even after putting tremendous effort, many things remain unclear and there is no where to turn to learn, other than depend upon the understanding of fellow students who themselves are struggling. \n\nKindly think twice before registering to this course if you don't know the entire subject matter beforehand, please don't expect to learn anything new from here as nothing is really 'taught' here. Hands down the worst class that I've ever taken in my life. The material isn't that difficult but the professor is just an amateur instructor.  This was my first course on the OMSCS which I liked overall. My background in Java helped out a lot in the assignments but some of them were pretty tough such as working with Datalog. TAs and instructors were really helpful on Piazza and would promptly answer any questions raised. Midterm and Finals were challenging but very fair and would focus on testing the understanding of the concepts taught in class. I liked that there were a lot of assignments that tested most stuff taught in class to help in understanding and getting to use real live tools used in industry to showcase the concepts taught in class.  This was my first course in the OMSCS program.  \nThis course provided an introduction to a variety of software analysis and testing methodologies.  The tests were tough but representative of assignments and lecture materials.  The assignments used a variety of programming languages (which I thoroughly enjoyed) and gave insight to the usage of the techniques from the lectures.  The assignments at first pass came across as difficult but after reviewing the assignment instructions in more detail, the instructors gave plenty of hints and suggestions of how to proceed.\nThe use of Piazza as a forum made getting information from instructors, TAs and fellow students simple and convenient.  The instructors were responsive and helpful as were the TAs.  Additionally, using Office Hours linked to a Piazza post with times into the recorded videos made finding answers to questions convenient and relatively pain-free.\nSince this was my first course in the program I don't have much basis for comparison, but I can't think of much that could have made this course better. This course was very hard, but if you want to be exposed to some bleeding-edge research on analysis and testing techniques then I highly recommend this class. Ok, bleeding-edge might be a bit of a stretch, but you will learn something new :-).  Also, fair warning to those considering this as your first class. This class can take a lot of time depending on your background. Don't let the average workload fool you. My background academic experience consisted of predominately electrical engineering courses sprinkled with skeleton computer science code problems during my undergraduate program. My current job is a System Administrator and I hardly touch code. I can definitely say I this class took a lot of time due to my background. If you are like me and you don't have a decent amount of software development experience, I would recommend taking SDP before this class. You definitely don't have to take Software Development Process before this one to excel, but I believe SDP would give you the exposure of typical bugs software engineers/software developers would encounter. This exposure would give the student a deeper appreciation of techniques presented in this course. I believe anyone can take this class and do well if you work hard; however, to shave off time of some of the projects it will serve you well to have a solid grasp of C/C++ i.e pointers, pass-by-reference, STL, etc. and Java, some graph theory terminology i.e. node, edge, path, directed etc, algorithms of common data structures such as trees, linked lists, and arrays, very basic probability and statistics, and all of the common operations from Set Theory. If you decide not to brush up in these areas you can still do well, but it may be a bit of a struggle.  If you have questions during the course, don't be afraid to ask the instructors, they won't bite :-). If I had done this for the first couple of projects of the course, I more than likely would have had a better outcome.  What can I say? This was my first rodeo so I had to live and learn. Exams are very hard and will require a good bit of study time to do well. For my class, they provided a very watered-down version of the exams as a review and that helped a lot. This was my first of two classes in the OMS program and I did learn a lot. Hopefully, this review will be of some help to you and I wish you the best in your future endeavors with this program. Good luck!  In a sentence, the material is interesting but assignments' docs too suck and staff too sour to enjoy course much. Still, recommended if keen interest in the topic. \n\nRe: my ratings, I attempt to succinctly capture every detail from the lectures, so I end up spending a lot of time on the OMSCS courses, including this one. \n\nI found most of the assignments really difficult, mostly because the documentation provided with the software was bad and, strangely, there were no teacher-provided materials (other than scattershot Q&A) towards filling that in. Quite too much sleep-deprived hacking resulted. \n\nOn the other hand, the exams were well written and the practice exams helpful. I thought the video lectures also very well done. I didn't care much for the teaching interactions though, because they were aloof, with all that implies. Fellow students were more helpful (as is often the case). This was a fairly interesting class, with a few serious flaws. The teaching style of the professor was somewhat detached and aloof. He rarely showed up in Piazza, and left things mainly to students. The head TA was active, but his style was also a problem, usually answering questions with more complicated responses that did little to address the fundamental problems that students were having. \n\nThe assignments were written in a very dense academic style that made for a lot of confusion in the students. \n\nThe assignments were very challenging, with the mean scores on the low side. The assignments often required considerable outside research. In some cases we were referred to external resources and documentation that didn't match the stuff provided with the assignments. \n\nThe first assignment was on a tool called Dafny, and it wasn't covered in class at all. We were given the assignment with a brief overview, referred to the Dafny website, and left to puzzle it out on our own with virtually no instructor or TA guidance. \n\nThe midterm was very challenging, and didn't have enough time allocated for it. \n\nIn spite of all of this, the material was genuinely interesting. This could be a fantastic course if the problems were addressed.  Course seemed like a \"phoned in\" course to me. Neither TA's nor professors were very helpful with troubleshooting issues with provided VM, setup tips came from other students. Assignments lacke specifics in a lot of cases, making them harder than they should have been. Further, the two middle assignments were based on depricated APIs with not much in terms of information available on them, making those assignment even harder. The assignments and class lectures loosely fit together, but not well. \nAs for the exams, the mid-term was open book, but the material on the actual midterm exam did not match that covered in the provided practice midterm, nor in the office hours \"midterm review\" sessions. Granted, you were given 3 hrs to complete the midterm, but when the average grade was somewhere between 27-32 out of 50, something is just not right. \nI decided to drop the course after lack-luster performance on the midterm as well as several assignments, also after asking professor / TAs for help or clarification. The assignments and midterm were returned with virtually no explanation of what was done wrong, making learning from mistakes difficult at best. Further, when approached, the TAs / professor gave generic answers that did not really help much. \nMy advice, proceed with caution if you choose to take this course. Avoid it if you can, its not worth the time investment or hassle. Despite what the previous review said, you get as much out of this course as you put into it. The TAs were very responsive (usually my Piazza posts were responded to in less than an hour, and they were also almost always available on Slack for quick queries) and most of the time they were helpful without giving the lab away. Having said that, one of the labs was slightly problematic in that you either understood it or you didn't, and there was no help that could be given (other than \"don't overthink it\") without giving it away. However, this lab is being reworked for next semester, so that should no longer be an issue.\n\nIf you come into this class without knowing C++ (pointers and STL containers), C, Java and shell scripting to some degree, you are going to have a hard time. However, if you know these already, the class is not that hard. Some of the labs are head scratchers, but once you figure out what you need, you should have no difficulty completing them.\n\nIn summary, it's an interesting course, and, if you know how to program (and if you don't why are you doing a masters in CS?) then you should have no difficulty passing.\n\nOne other thing. Although I put down six hours per week, I actually did 11 hours some weeks and 1 hour on other weeks (watching a lecture) because the labs were due every two weeks. But that distribution has more to do with me putting off the labs until a few days before they were due rather than any issue with the course. Mid-semester review, for those looking at this course for Summer/Fall. I would highly recommend it! I think it would also be very doable as a Summer offering. The course is currently structured with half of the course grade coming from projects (some due within one week) and half coming from proctored tests. \n\nThe projects involve setting up and using a software analysis toolkit. These can sometimes be time consuming to setup, but generally take 5-10 hours at most to complete. The ones requiring code are in Java (so far) but you should also be able to read C. (two I haven't seen yet)\n\nTests are fairly straightforward, mainly coming from the quizzes in the lectures, which are high quality. The tests are long, and it was not uncommon in the midterm for students to work up to the time limit. They are open note. \n\nIf possible, take CCA and or InfoSec prior to this class. Lots of overlap, and you will be very comfortable with the theoretical material here if you have taken CCA prior.  Not a good class.\n\nMaterial: The first half of the class teaches you some outdated APIs with little to no documentations, which feel like some orphaned research project. I fail to see how they can be any use once you move outside of academia. Second half teaches you tools that may actually be useful, but less than 50% good does not make up for the horrid 50%.\nAssignments: Extremely frustrating. Some assignments are extremely easy while the some are very difficult, not because you learn some difficult yet interesting concept, but because they are designed to be - otherwise all the assignments will take only a few hours to complete. Most assignments are auto-graded, so if you have typos in your typed answer don't expect any leniency. There's no Slack chat for the class - again if one existed the assignments would have been super easy. Some can be completed by \"throwing random inputs at the wall and see what sticks\", which is actually a valid testing framework, according to some lecture.\nLectures: Difficult concepts are skimped, while lecturer spends a lot of time explaining obvious, common-sense concepts. Lectures are mostly disconnected with assignments. Expect maybe 10 minutes of useful materials and 30 minutes of filler contents, and unlike ESPN the filler contents can give you a coma. Examples are not adequate so the office hours are mandatory if you want to understand what's going on, which you really don't since....\nExams: Completely different from the samples and the lectures. I mean, seriously, if I didn't study Statistics in college (yes, statistics) I would have easily lost 25% on the exams. Esoteric concepts from lectures were drilled, so you have to really think outside of the box. It's excellent to get students to drop the class and apparently so, since piazza traffics pretty went quiet the weeks after the midterm.\nTAs and Professor: The Professor did not show up at all so we can safely disregard him. TAs work really hard answering questions and maintaining conversation but harder not revealing solutions. I feel sorry for them, since their hands are tied. The way assignments are simply prevent them from having a meaningful conversation about the concepts. Sometimes by explaining things in a non-revealing way they ended up confusing people. \n\nSave your time and $800+ and take another class.  This was a good class. It was well organized and presented some interesting topics. There's no reading, and the assignments were typically not that difficult (there is one that requires you to learn DataLog which is tough but definitely doable). The exams were tough, but fair. The concepts presented in the lectures aren't too difficult to wrap your mind around, and I found many of them very interesting. \n\nSome of the other reviews complain that the tools used are out of date, which is true. However, they're still interesting to use in terms of learning the concepts and thinking about how you could apply the ideas to your day to day work. Of all of the OMSCS classes I've taken, this one actually has some direct use in the industry (e. g. statistical debugging). \n\nThe class seemed well-run, with assignments being returned within a week in some cases. There were recorded office hours weekly which was helpful with some assignments. Reading others reviews sounds like many people hated this class [like me]. In summary I do not recommend taking this class no matter what your specialization is. Do yourself, your family, friends and coworkers a favor and drop it. Also this class isn't really related to software testing and analysis, they took the concept from Stanford CS243: Program Analysis and Optimization and few other compiler design classes and made it up.  This class was pretty awful. It is the first class I had taken in teh OMSCS program and it was a horrible experience. The lectures were terrible and maye 2 of the 11 lectures helped with the assignments. The exams were also terrible. They give you practice exams and you work to make sure you could work out the practice exams to beable to do the quiz problems that are in the lecture to find out the actual exams are nothing like either of them. They contain alot of concept knowledge in which the lectures bareley go over. For the most part, the assignment are do able, just take a lot of time and hitting yourself in the head but the exams are tough. I am struggling to get a B. Excellent presentation, clear and concise lectures\nVery good overview over modern, academic approaches\nExpands thinking about testing and offers a glimpse into academic advances \nQuizzes in lectures really help understanding the content\nVery well paced, consistent amount of work every week\nGreat choice of topics, good little insights into previous and current research\nVery active professor and TAs\nGenerous grading curve Software testing and analytical skills is a must for security application developers. It should help software testers to reduce bug count before deployment and manage bugs when software is in production. Back to the course. Basically it covers 3 types of software testing & analysis methodologies: static, dynamic and a combination of the two. The coding assignments overlaps reinforce the lectures. Some were very challenging; however they provide output goals for each. Personally I didn't have a problem doing the coding assignments, the exams were more challenging to get an A in. The class average on the 2nd exam was approximately 68. Think critically about the lectures. This was my first summer class, and it was perfect for it. There was a lot of material crammed into a few weeks, but I felt the amount and complexity were fair for the time. \n\nThe field of analysis and testing was pretty new to me, so I learned a whole lot of new methods and techniques. Every lesson was about something new and exciting that we got to apply right away on one of the multiple assignments we had. It is a very hands-on class, so be ready to use Java and have a deadline almost every week. \n\nThe two exams were open notes. I had to put a lot of hours studying the material and I fared very well on both. The questions were fair and covered the content of the lessons, but you have to make sure to know it all, albeit of having the notes in front of you. This class was next to useless. There is such a broad overview of so many different testing strategies and techniques that you never actually learn anything in depth about any one specific thing. Additionally, the lectures are extremely boring and only contain small tidbits of information needed for the assignments and tests, they're all very long, and there are also a lot of them. It took way too long to get feedback for assignments and there was literally a month long break in the middle of the semester.  Really engaging class with a ton of instructor support. Highly recommended if you are just starting the OMSCS program as it eases you into the school schedule. The course content lead to more investigation into different testing frameworks and code analysis that I am able to apply at work! Quick background about me that might help understand the context of the review: I am a software developer working full time in a corporation (12+ yrs). Im quite comfortable coding large pieces of backend code (servers) mainly in C/C++.\n\nWith that said, here is my take on this subject:\nI found this course very well organized. The lectures correlated well with the projects and was quite informative on the latest trends in the software testing field.\nAlthough the projects were quite straight forward, I found the writeups associated with the projects a little tricky. Especially when it came down to grading these projects, i found some of the answers content to be subjective\n\nThe exams a bit challenging and needed some solid preparation before hand. Getting a good grade in the exams required a good understanding of the topics covered.\n\n\nIn summary: \n1. Very well organized course and lecture videos\n2. Very responsive and helpful TAs and prof(s)\n3. The content was informative and the up-to-date tools used provided useful insight into incorporating them in real world scenarios\n4. The exams were not multiple choice and was not easy. It required a good understanding of the topics covered. What a great class! I think some people are expecting a \"how to unit test\" type class, but it really dives deep into how software can be analyzed at both the static and dynamic levels. There's a lot of depth to this area, and I feel like this class gave me a foundation to dive into the theory and application of so many techniques. This class is basically using tools that only grad students use which makes it hard to google. I was able to ask lots of questions and make my way through the course. It did introduce me to some pretty cool testing tools for Android but the other tools were a pain and will probably never be used again. I would recommend this course as it does add value. This was one of the more difficult classes I've ever taken. It's the only time I can recall ever having to just completely give up on getting an assignment to work and just turned in something I know didn't work. A majority of the assignments were not too difficult and only took a few hours. On the other hand, the ones that were harder than average seemed almost impossible to complete. The lectures were very well done and he gives you just about everything you need to know to trudge and sweat your way through the exams. (The exams were open note... but they really aren't useful except to try to confirm some basic facts you aren't 100% sure of. ) That's because most of the time on the exam will be spent trying to decipher most of the questions that seem to be written as a brain teaser than an exam question. If the exam questions were more straightforward, I would be happier with this class overall. Do not try to cheat your way through this class. He will run your code through a plagarism detection system (MOSS). I didn't cheat, but it still stressed me out a lot that there were announcements saying people who cheated should confess or be reported to the dean. I would always worry that the system might flag my submission as a false positive when it was analyzed. This is probably the second most stressful class I've taken in the program. If I knew what I was getting into with this one, I probably would have just taken something else. The topics covered were far from what I was expecting. I wish they would break this into 2 classes... One for testing and one for analysis. I don't think I gained much personal benefit from the analysis part and very little useful knowledge from the testing part... Overall, a thumbs down from me. The biggest positive right now is that I took the final yesterday and I am just so happy that is over and done! Overall:\nI enjoyed this class and the material it covered. It had more of a \"testing in theory\" instead of \"testing in practice\" approach that I found refreshing. I didn't find the class too difficult and it served nicely as a companion course in a semester where I needed to take two classes. \n\nWhat I enjoyed:\nI found the material covered in the course quite interesting especially in the second half of the course. \nThe majority of the assignments mapped to the material quite nicely with the exceptions listed below. \nThe tests were somewhat difficult but really helped solidify my understanding of the material instead of being an exercise in memorization. \nThe TAs (and other students) were helpful on Piazza. \n\nMy concerns:\nThe first assignment didn't align well to the material covered in the lecture. It's not a major issue but it wasn't clear what they really wanted us to get out of the material based on what was on the exam. \nThe last two assignments were too easy and didn't feel like they required an understanding of the material to complete. \nThe last lesson (dynamic-symbolic execution) didn't have an associated assignment which was disappointing. \nThe lesson on type systems didn't have an associated assignment. \n\nConcerns I heard from others:\nThe class sometimes requires you to use outdated APIs that are no longer supported/poorly documented. I agree with this but it wasn't a major headache as I've had similar experiences with other classes. Just know what you're getting into. \nThe APIs are difficult to get set up. I used the class VM and kept up on Piazza so this wasn't an issue for me. \nMost of the material was recycled from a course offered by Stanford. I think that the material/assignments can be freshened up a bit per my comments above but this doesn't bother me. \nLack of involvement by the professors. I agree but I think this is normal for many other classes I've taken. The TAs were helpful and the profs were active on Piazza prior to exams. This was my first OMSCS course and overall I liked it. I have a background in Java and C/C++ and that helped me on the lab assignments. The hardest part of the class for me were figuring out how to start some of the lab assignments we had. A few of the more difficult labs felt like we covered a topic briefly in a lecture, and then we had to immediately work on a full lab regarding this topic. This led to me having a hard time initially figuring out how to start a few labs, and I only made it halfway through lab 5 because I had a hard time understanding Datalog. Even though I didn't do well on lab 5, I did fine on the midterm and final (which I felt were both challenging but fair, the final wasn't cumulative but was harder than the midterm) and got a B in the class. For NON-traditional students \u2013 the course is not difficult but expects you to be familiar with many different tools. Don\u2019t get caught because you not familiar with basic linux debugging for java and c.", 
    "CS-6400": " This class would be really enjoyable if the project was individual. Believe me, if you are unlucky to get a team where people are lost, you'll end up working yourself in a relatively big project (specially at the 3rd phase, you'll miss weekends for some time). Exams are tricky and sometimes feel like they are trying to evaluate how well you capture and memorize random pieces of data from the textbook rather than actually evaluating what you understood from the lectures. Lectures and videos are really nice and well done. TAs are sometimes very inaccessible when trying to get regrades with strong demonstrable arguments, and they'll even respond with things like \"because I say so\". If you pick it, just cross fingers to get a good team. This course is too basic for a graduate level course. To be fair, it did cover everything that the syllabus mentions, and I have a few years of application development experience. But still, I expected it to be a much deeper course. We did not even cover the basics of locking and transactions. I was expecting a deeper understanding of these concepts, as well as may be query optimization which are extremely relevant in today's world of distributed computing. Instead, the course spends inordinate amount of time on ER diagrams and ER modeling, which are outdated tools. Nobody uses them in the industry for any real world project. Piazza posts/questions tended to be left unanswered for a long time, or left with student answers with no instructor endorsement.\n\nI had a great team, so the project execution was fun and painless. But I can see that if you mess up in picking the team (wide range of tie zones, wide range of capabilities etc.), then you might struggle a bit with projects. However, the project itself isn't too hard. Even a single person can do it. The struggle would be with coordinating between team mates, if you end up with a bad team.\n\nThe reason I say you cannot Front load the work is only because the team project will only move at the team's pace. Rest of the content can be learned quickly.\n\nVery lightweight course. I feel I wasted a course as I did not learn anything new. It is a foundational course though, so that's good. This is basically an easy version of undergrad DBMS course. Your mileage will vary. I'd suggest keeping it for when you need an easy credit. My lowest grade in 7 courses before this class was an 89. Let's just say, I sunk lower. This class is not a joke, and I suspect it's not what it was before the change in professor/approach. The projects are expansive and teach a lot about good design. You're working in teams, though, and despite their pleas to the contrary, that means you're practically only going to get hands-on experience with some of this. \n\nThe exams, are - to me - a bummer. They account for 50% of the total grade. They are 25 questions each, which means your margin for error is slim. And aggravatingly, each contained one or two trick questions that were intended to catch you on some technicality or wording instead of testing your knowledge. I spent probably 20-25 hours studying for each and did not do well on one of them. I've been using SQL databases in my job for nearly 20 years, so this was a pretty befuddling result. \n\nIn all, I think the class is in the lower half of the pack for OMSCS. The TAs were great, the professor is active. And while there were a few slip-ups in logistics (dates, grades, etc), I've seen worse. Don't expect to learn much about current best practices in database architecture and design. This was much closer to what I would have expected from an undergrad class. The videos, though high quality and well produced, seemed incomplete and poorly ordered. Video wise I learned much more from the freely available db classes on youtube (by stanford, peirce college, and houston clear lake). The exam questions were more tricky than than a test of knowledge (thus the difficulty rating). And no one in 2017 is going to need that much in depth knowledge about calculating index size. A unit on some of the new db trends (ie NoSQL), would have been time much better spent. Or maybe an actual case study of redesigning a problematic db application. \n\nThe class project is more about application programming than anything to do with db architecture and design. The db architecture and sql required were rudimentary imo. The programming, while not advanced, was extensive. Much larger than the db piece. Heaven help you if you get a bad team-- the group project will be a nightmare. Make sure everyone on your team has some level of programming experience. \n\nBEWARE the phase3 of the project. It's graded more about how you do the demo and programming than ANYTHING having to do with DB design and architecture. Even if your app is bullet proof be sure to conduct the demo in such a was as to go through the instructions ONE BY ONE calling out where your app meets the description. Don't count on the TA to ask you about anything you may have forgotten or been nervous and overlooked. \n\nAnd yes, as stated by the other reviewers, the class was tight and well run, the instructor (Jay) very attentive, knowledgeable, and responsive in piazza. Overall I like this class, but I wished the professor and the TAs are more organized (they sometime argue with each other on the requirements for the project on office hour). Also I feel like I spent more time on designing and developing the UI instead of working on the database/sql. If you are coming to this course with very little experience in databases, as I did, expect to learn a LOT but be prepared to put in the effort. Compared to my previous OMSCS course (6300), I would say I averaged twice as many hours reading through the (often dense) textbook and studying for exams. The real gem was the project, where we learned everything from designing databases with diagrams and understanding DB concepts (EER, IFD, relations), to implementing them using languages and tools I'd never programmed in before (MySQL, Php, HTML, MAMP). It provided me with not only a working prototype of a database in action, but also with a great experience working with teammates who I plan to keep in contact with. By comparison, the four exams only nominally helped to prepare us for each phase of the project, and seemed much more difficult than initial self-study and sample exams would indicate. I think that pacing in the course could be improved; the beginning felt very rushed to complete everything, whereas by the end it felt like there wasn't enough to keep us busy. It was up to us to plan our learning material consumption, but the deadlines with exams and project phases did not always give ideal time lengths to prepare. Professor Mark and the TAs are knowledgeable and approachable, though if you really want questions answered be prepared to ask during office hours. Overall, it was a challenging course and I liked certain parts more than others, but I definitely learned a lot. The course is introductory. The first two phases of the project were ok. In the 3rd and final phase you are required to demonstrate the database with a UI. However they give you no training in creating a UI. If you don't have people on your team who have done this sort of thing before you are in for trouble. In the demo that you are required to give at the end of the phase there is no proper rubric as to what and how you are required to demonstrate. No complete guidelines. They give you something called a demo guidelines for phase 3. Even if you have it all working according to those guidelines you will have points deducted because some column is not sorted by date by default. I think the project should only test you on what is taught in the class. Not on how well you create a UI that interacts with your database. That is completely outside the scope of what is taught. This is the part that makes it hard. Otherwise the instructor was quick to respond to many things in piazza. The main TA Will regularly took part in office hours. The other TAs are invisible. This was my first course in the OMSCS program. I was lucky to have a great team for the group project, so that eased some of the tension around the massive project- which, required a lot of coding outside of SQL. I enjoyed the lectures, which were done by Dr. Leo Mark. The exams were more challenging than the sample ones that were distributed. Everyone on the teaching staff was very responsive and very helpful when questions arose (for me, our team, and for the class). If you have experience in databases, this class is nothing new. The assignments in this class take a large amount of time but are not too difficult. Be prepared to spend 40+ hours on the final project. The tests are on easy topics but they are difficult because the questions are purposely tricky. Also there are many disconnects between the required text book and the Udacity lectures. I have database work experience and learn very little from this class. Although textbook has been updated to include new technology such as NoSQL, it is not covered in the lecture. The class project focused too much on web development as opposed to the database. There are a lot of ambivalent requirements which generated tons of questions in Piazza, which led to lengthy discussions that turns into bad feeling and snarky arguments. There is no helpfulness or positive encouragement provided in learning. Lots of negative responses and sarcasm. First, you need to search and read through all piazza posts before asking your question (to avoid annoying the TAs). Second, you didn't get a straight answer most of the time, so might as well do the research yourself. My take on group project: there will always be someone who doesn't do any work. With that in mind, always focused on your own learning and not worry with what other people do or don't. If you're lucky to find good people, it's a bonus!  if not, that's okay too. The exams are open book and open note, total 4 exams. They are difficult and tricky. The project is painful and lots of UI work (such as dynamic drop-down parameters).  Use PHP to create the project because there will be examples provided. I would avoid this class.  4 Exams, 2 so far, both open book notes. All easy I thought although median / avg was mid 80s. Projects are team based but not terribly difficult, especially with multiple input from teammates to correct mistakes. For someone completely new to databases/SQL some added SQL examples would be helpful (Stanford's intro to databases class on coursera / youtube goes into more detail). The professor and TAs are quite active, especially near the due dates. This is midway through semester, I expect project work to ramp up a little later in the semester during implementation. \nEdit: So I would definitely say the course gets harder later on in the semester since the final project implementation came 1 week after an exam this semester. Make sure you have lots of free time the two weeks before that. updating average workload from 4 to 5 hrs as the beginning of the semester was still low commitment Well organized course presented by effective, patient, knowledgeable and responsive instructor Jay Summet, and Will, Emile, Aoyi, Peter, Tosh, and other TAs were responsive and dedicated. \nDo not expect an easy \"A\" (low percentage A's). Material covers nearly 700 pages from textbook (read carefully), covers EERD, relationships, relational algebra and calculus, SQL, functional dependencies and normalization, as well as indexing. Four exams divided content logically, but tricky questions yielded low class averages (70, 71, 72, 80). \nSemester long group project spans three phases to design and build functional web site with SQL DB back-end. Teams allowed freedom to choose DB and development stack (php, python, java, javascript, etc). Project required substantial time investment. Choose your team carefully based upon skill and commitment. My background is not in CS and I hadn't designed databases before I took this course. I think this course is an easy introduction to databases for students without DB experience. For advanced students, I think this course might be on the light side of the spectrum. Exams are super easy (I got 100 from all of them). Phase 1 and 2 of the project are easy too. The only challenging part of this class is the phase 3 of the project. Having good team members helps a lot in phase 3. The exams are open book; however, you will have a hard time if you take the exam without reading the book in detail. I think this is a very useful course. Project bit can be a bit hard for people new to database but it is well worth the effort.  The course had a lot of potential, but started at too basic a level. I'd have preferred diving right into Relational Algebra and Relational Tuple Calculus, as well as covering more advanced DB topics. It seems like the first half of the course was a remedial introduction to concepts that should have been familiar to master's degree students. \n\nThe final project was a really jarring change from the rest of the class, where we had to implement a functioning webapp. This divided the class into two camps: full time developers who could do it easily, and non-programmers who struggled with the implementation.  There's 4 exams and a group project with 3 phases. Basically watch 20 minutes of videos and read a couple chapters every 3 weeks for the exams. And the group project has some videos of how to do each stage. Overall about 5-10 hours of studying for each exam and about 10-20 hours of work for each stage of the project. Main criticism is the professors and TAs love \"gotcha\" questions and grading for the exams and project. If you aren't good with study and work at your own pace you can fall behind as well. This wasn't a hard class, and it wasn't necessarily an easy class. There are two big problems from this semester. First, the project and the exams are completely disparate. There is one set of lecture videos for the exams and another for the projects. It makes budgeting time a little weird, especially since the project is groupwork, so you also have to work around other's schedules. \n\nThe other issue is that the project was not well defined. After the first part of the project was completed, it was clear that the requirements were vague and the desired app had a lot of holes. No feedback came for part 1 until a week before part 2 was due. And then 3 was released with a truncated set of requirements. \n\nUltimately, this course is good if you are looking to learn about databases at a very basic level, and how database development should fit into application development processes. I have been working with SQL DBs for over a decade and also took an undergraduate DB course. The material was mostly review for me, although it had been a while since I used relational algebra and I had not have any formal training on functional dependencies before. \n\nWhile the material was pretty easy, the workload was not as light for me as it was for others. Every week or other week there was a project due or an exam to study for. The book is of limited value, but I recommend getting a copy to lookup some of the more obscure questions during tests. The 4th test was by far the hardest for me, so just because you demo'd your project to the TAs does not mean that you are out of the woods. \n\nAs a previous poster mentioned, some students had ProctorTrack issues with exam 3 and the TAs ended up dropping the lowest of our first 3 test grades to compensate. It is hard to say here who was at fault since the majority of us were able to complete the exam. There were also reports of students not downloading the diagrams ahead of time on the first 2 exams as instructed, which makes me wonder if there was not a bit of user error here. If you are in a graduate CS program and cannot figure out how to get proctoring software to work on your workstation, then you may be in the wrong field of study. It is possible that there were some technical diffuculties, but I am personally not convinced. \n\nAnother issue in my opinion is in regards to the weight that is placed on the part 3 of the class project. This is by far the most time consuming part of the class and is worth the same as parts 1 and 2. Based on level of effort alone, it feels like it should be worth what parts 1 and 2 were combined (i. e. double). \n\nOn a positive note, the lectures were pretty entertaining as the professor is somewhat of an amateur comedian. \n\nIn my opinion, this is good fit for those looking to obtain the Computing Systems specialization, even though my run of the course did not go off without a hitch. This is a very well organized course, thanks to Jay, Will and other TAs. This is particularly true when it is compared to CES 6242, a complete disaster reviewed separately, this semester. Jay is a great professor, he is knowledgeable, responsive, and respectful, though i have a different opinion regarding the exam questions (I run my own graduate course for four years in Europe). Of course, my old friend Will is great as usual, I will perhaps miss his long but detailed posts on piazza in the future. \n\nBeing a graduate course, the topics covered here are fundamental, but never assume an easy \"A\". This course, arguably, has the lowest percentage of \"A\" among all the OMSCS courses. The exam questions are purposely tricky. There were four exams in total, the grade mediums are below 80 (out of 100) except one exam. Though my grades are 2~4 sd higher than the medium, but I do not believe that tricky questions are good to motivate studies. Another thing I would approach differently is the course content, instead of emphasizing on EER diagram which is essentially a formalization to represent information, I prefer to dig deeper in more practical issues, e. g., query performance optimization, normalization, or non-SQL database. In addition, I suggest to remove exam #3 for SQL and move the questions to other exams, there are so many moving parts in the course, which makes it hard to follow. \n\nIn the group project, we were asked to build a fully functional web application with a database back-end. This is not hard but you have to invest serious amount of time. I am having a hard time to believe people only spent five hours per week can contribute much to the project. My advise is that pick your teammates wisely, preferably someone has previous experience on developing similar applications, and read the book carefully. Great class, well taught, but if you've used SQL before it probably is not worth taking. Take a class that you'll learn more in. Doesn't really get into depth with some of the \"newer\" things in DBs like distributed databases, NoSQL DBs, etc. Be careful with this course. The first three months are hardly anything. The project is an app to support transaction processing and report generation, with the first phases consisting of logical modeling, turning in a few diagrams and reports, involving maybe a few hours of work on each person's part. \n\nThen you implement it. It's not a huge chore, but you have to build the database, find a place to host it, connect it to a server with the business logic, with a working ui on the front end that supports all of the required forms. To prove it works, you populate it with a dummy history. Simple enough, but right at the last minute, they threw up samples that had to be in with specific dates that were months in the past. If you implemented a correct database, one of the constraints is transactions can't take place in the past, so at the last minute you go in, remove the constraints, throw in the transactions, fix the schema and hope you didn't break anything so the gotchas in your demo don't return bad query results. \n\nThe kicker is the final is a few days later, covering material that bears no relation to anything else we did (indexing and physical file organization), from lectures that weren't available on Udacity until a few weeks prior when we were right in the heat of the project. That project, which takes up more time than the rest of the course combined, is worth 10% of the grade, and the exams are all multiple choice with 0 partial credit, so you get the final asking you exactly how many bytes are required to implement a specific kind of dense index and if you're off by 20, 0 points. 25 questions, so 3 wrong and you no longer have an A. There's no curve, so you can see for yourself that somehow one of the easiest courses in the program ends up with one of the lowest grade distributions. All because of highly weighted exams that were regularly regraded because the answer keys were wrong or in some cases the questions didn't even have clear right answers at all.  Overall good course if you don't have a lot of experience developing an application and want to learn. You create an application for a food bank where you can create users, view/edit profiles, manage inventory, send and accepts requests and manage clients to use the services. The content of exams is easy, but the questions are tricky. I haven't learned that much new things from this course. I use relational databases on a daily basis for work. My expectation when taking this course was to get a deeper understanding of relation databases or learn about new technologies like NOSQL databases. The course is strictly focused on relational databases only. It covers some internals of a relation database organization. The TAs were great. Especially the lead TA was very helpful. I found the difficulty level to be very easy.  Unfortunately I had different expectations coming into this class. I use relational databases heavily in my work (MySQL). I wanted to learn the mechanisms behind relational databases and understand what makes them different from more modern \"NoSQL\" databases. The overlap between what I wanted to know and what I learned amounted to a few blog posts worth of information. \n\nThis class is great if you don't know what a relational database is (or even a database for that matter) and want to progress to understanding how to implement one.  Spends 75% of the course on basic concepts you should know if you know anything about databases. The other 25% is a shitty overview of database performance. The project is a mess. The requirements document is a garbled word vomit of ideas and requirements which really hurt the head. It is really 75% web development project and 25% database, which is a mistake by whichever idiot thought up the project. Done properly the project should take 200 hours to complete, which is an inappropriate amount of time a project in an ms program should take. Overall this class was terribly executed. Unfortunately the guy executing it makes nearly 300K per year, go figure. Course content itself is easy and covers basic concepts. If you've worked with ORMs and know basic SQL, you won't learn much. The EER diagrams, schema design, and normalization content is useful. Read a book and don't take the course if that's what you're looking to learn. If you haven't done web development, you will learn a lot from the final project which is a web application. The database component is a decent component to the project, but there's a lot of unnecessary UI requirements. Many requirements are arbitrary and not relevant to the database (i.e. drop downs, radio buttons, printable pages, unit conversion).\n\nProject was terrible. It wasn't reviewed for accuracy or the actual technical requirements that students were supposed to get from it. It was refined over the semester, and felt like the instructional team was making it up along the way, which led to a lot of questions on Piazza. No rubrics were provided for the three project phase submissions. Grading is inconsistent. I had a great group, which made it bearable. Choose your group wisely and try to find others that can complement your skills for the project. There's a team formation period so use that time wisely to find others who are motivated and engaged.\n \nExams were fair for the most part. The last exam was pretty tough as some of the questions, especially calculation questions on indexes, efficiency, and performance weren't like those found in the book or sample exam. Still possible to do well if you think through it carefully. Be prepared for 1-2 questions that don't cover the content assigned in the syllabus. Be prepared for 1-2 tricky questions per exam that assess small details that aren't relevant or core to the course material.\n\nInstructors were not responsive. The head TA was pretty defensive in some initial threads which didn't create a welcoming or positive learning environment on Piazza. Many Piazza threads were never answered, including exam questions and project requirements. The instructor asked for feedback in the middle of the course (which many students appreciated including myself) after some students communicated about the negativity on the forums and the somewhat artful deception of the few exam questions I mentioned before. Most of those threads went unanswered even after the instructor said he'd follow up with individual responses.  \n  \nHope positive changes actual take place in future offerings. I'd recommend the class for those uninitiated with web and SQL. A lot of people already familiar with databases tend to not like the course. Terrible textbook but enjoyable lectures. The group project can make this a very time-consuming class if your team isn't helpful. This class spent a good amount of time on theory (relational algebra) and documentation (EER). I would have preferred a class that covered a broader range of topics (like NoSQL and some cloud-related topics) This course is awesome, I really love it. The exams are a little tricky, but reasonable. The project is well designed if you do not hate to code for a web.  Comments from classmates are varied on the difficulty of this course. Those who work on DBs or have taken a DB class before found this class easy. I found it hard. Not only that, I have taken 6 courses so far and I consider this class the worse of all. Granted, it was the first time this course was offered in this program. However, there are things that should have been taken care of by a professor who has tough the subject before. To start with, we did not have a syllabus. The one provided by the teacher was a very high level organization of the course, which did not help much. We, students were the ones who put together a syllabus. The organization of the course was terrible as well. We had 4 exams. The first two covered easy material with plenty of time. The last two covered much more difficult material with less time to study it. Many questions on the open-book tests were written in a convoluted manner, so difficult to understand that even the professor gave the wrong answers to the TAs consistently in the first 3 tests for about 10% of the questions. \n\nEach exam had 25 questions worth 1 point each but, at the end, the exam grade was multiplied by 4. Many questions covered more than one knowledge item so if you missed one of the concepts you would still have the whole question wrong. \n\nYou need to start early studying for exams. Once the exam period starts (and I'm not talking about the actual exam), we were not allowed to ask any questions regarding the subjects covered on the test, which I thought was an unfortunate and ill-advised rule. \n\nThe TAs were very helpful and questions were answered right away. In addition, many of the students taking the class had advanced DB knowledge and were eager to help in Piazza. \n\nThe subject was very interesting and a must (the subject of DBs) for any student on this program. I think it should be taken early as it could be used on other classes. \n\nOverall, I disliked the course, although I liked the subject.  I shared no less pain and sympathy with other students who had problem in this course. I also have the same observation about this poorly managed course by the instructor team, especially the \"head TA, Will J\" and \"J Summet\". Inconsistent grading without auto grader and compulsory team project. I have collected some of your feedback to Dean Galil. Hopefully we will get a reply from him and I urge you to do so if you had strong negative feeling about this course. No future OMSCS students should suffer our pain again. Overall: this class should be called \"how to design and build database-backed web applications. \"\n\nIf that was the name of the class, I would have felt I got exactly what I signed up for. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this class. As for me, I was a little disappointed that the class didn't cover the design and implementation of RDBMS themselves, only the USE of database management systems to implement databases. IE. we didn't learn anything about how MySQL itself is implemented, but instead we learned a process and theory of how to model data using MySQL, if that makes sense. \n\nI will say, Dr. Mark is a very good instructor. The class videos were great, and the TAs were attentive and helpful. I wish Dr. Mark would offer an algorithms class, I'd love to take that :)\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI see some people said the tests were easy, I felt the tests in this class were brutal. The questions were *very* nitty gritty and subtle, and the multiple choice was usually given so that at least two of the answers were very close to the right answer. I studied at length and still averaged a B on the tests. The project was also a lot of work. I had a good team, which helped, but the grading seemed a little arbitrary. Coordinating with other team members required a lot of time and effort, just to keep track of who was doing what, etc. \n\nSome context, because I imagine a lot of you guys will be in the same situation. I think if you had a traditional CS background and had already taken an undergrad DB class, this would probably not be much new, and that would make it a lot easier. However, I am a self-taught programmer with no undergrad background, so there were a lot of little things about the relational algebra, calculus, etc, that I'd never seen before. This class was a good way to pick up a lot of that \"light math\" stuff, since the practical examples given in the class made it a little easier to absorb. This was a nice class. If you come with previous DB experience, it will be easy. If this is your first interaction with relational databases, then it will be harder. There are 4 open-notes exams. The 4th one was by far the most difficult. The final project will take a long time but everyone on my class fared very well. I continued breaking my rule of avoiding courses on their first run once again, when I took CS 6400. \n\nHaving made it through the entire semester, I found this course to be very easy at the beginning. The first two exams were essentially review for anyone who has done ER diagrams and relational modeling. The third and fourth exams were moderately difficult, with relational algebra/calculus and functional dependencies being the hardest concepts to master. Some of the exam questions regarding SQL were not everyday queries, so you did have to stop and think about what was being asked. Even though the exams were open book, not having lecture notes or some familiarity with the material would put you at a disadvantage. (Some students were \"kind\" enough to share their notes, and I'm surprised the instructors didn't put the kibosh on that. )\n\nConcurrent with learning about the theories, we had a group project assignment. As always, the most important factor is your fellow group members. I was lucky to have a hard-working team, which made me sad that there were no peer evaluations, as I would have gladly given them all positive feedback. (One problem with group formation is that there was a \"re-org\" deadline for groups to reform after a member dropped the course, that was before the final drop deadline. So some groups had less manpower if someone dropped after the \"re-org\". ) The timeframe for each phase of the project got progressively shorter and shorter, and so the effort level had to kick up a notch or two by the end of the semester. There was also a final WebEx presentation that didn't quite have all the kinks worked out, but was effective. \n\nAll in all I enjoyed this course and I found the later material very interesting and can say I learned something new. Dr. Mark, while no longer actively researching, clearly is an expert in the topic and has great opinions. The lead TA did a commendable job keeping things organized. It was a good experience.  If you do SQL at work, you do have a mild advantage in this class. However, the 4 tests also cover EER, relational algebra, relational calculus, EER to relational mapping, function dependencies, normalization, file organization, and indexing. Exam averages were 74, 71, 85, 69, but project grades had much higher averages, 87 and 90 for the first two phases. The full-stack project this semester was very time consuming, but the database parts were less than the majority of the work in phase 3. Choose your teammates wisely and finish phase 3 coding early because there is an exam and extra work in the form of sample data (3k lines of SQL inserts in our case) and a demo to prepare at the end. Phase three of the project is primarily graded via the demo where you checkout the code from github, load the sample data into MySQL and walk through the demo via Bluejeans with a TA in 25 minutes or less. Check the schedule for your semester, and if its the same, yes, finish coding early. They are not kidding about the importance of practicing the demo. Recent topics like NoSQL and big data are not covered, yet. As mentioned by other reviewers, Prof. Jay Summet was very engaged on Piazza. He and the TAs were extremely helpful answering questions about the material on Piazza and the regularly scheduled office hours. The class was well organized and well run. This is a pretty solid course on dB design. It focused a great deal on theory. Lectures were very well prepared- although I personally prefer 1-2 longer videos edited together instead of having to click through 6-8 short clips. Lectures alone did not prepare nearly enough for exams. You HAVE to have the textbook in order to fully understand the content. The course project was the best part of the course, but (at least my team) spent way more time on the application development than the dB design. I enjoyed this course and working on the project, but be warned- there is very little hands on database design and practical examples.. and quite a bit entity design and diagramming.  You are going to learn nothing but waste a lot of time. This was a class that started out not tame, but really ramped up towards the end.  Phase 3 is a huge amount of work, and the final test 2 weeks later is the hardest of the semester.  You'll spend hours upon hours on Phase 3 and that final exam.  The whole class is structured around designing and building a database-backed application (like many websites you might have used).  It is a lot of fun to work on Phase 3, since it's all about implementing something using MySQL+PHP, Python, etc that you've been designing all semester.  But the graders are rather tough about the first two phases having the diagrams and pseudocode being perfect, when in reality a lot of the pseudocode gets changed when actual implementation occurs (at least in my case).\n\nAll in all it's a good class, and the workload you have really depends on your group.  But it's more than you think, and I don't recommend taking a second class with this.  The workload isn't much at first, but watch out at the end of the semester since a ton of work hits you all at once even with the revised schedule in Spring 2018. I loved this subject. The instructor was really good. The TAs were pretty understanding when there were grade disputes and most often they favored the students. In all very nice course to learn more about Databases. I wish I could take this again. I see many others' reviews are saying that this course is too basic for a graduate class. However, I would think the difficulty is right perfect for me. The course covers many, if not all, basic DB Management and Design topics (IDF, EER, Relational DB, Relational Algebra, SQL syntax, etc). I personally do not care about the Relational Algebra or some other theoretical stuff, but I do care about practical skills that I can put into use in industry. \nI like the layout of this course given a hands-on project is included. The project mimics a real-world request from an IT company's imaginative client --- Students were required to form a group of 4 and the eventual goal is to design both a DB and a web interface ( something like a php UI) for a tool rental company's employees to look up/update the DB. Very interesting! \n\nNevertheless, I don't really agree with the course creator on the grading breakdown. The four exams accounted for too much of a percentage (15% each), while the final phase of the course project took us 20+hours per week but it accounted for merely 10%. Also a few exam questions were kind of controversial.  The text is clear, formal, and helpful. The project assignments are illustrative, though part 3 is irrelevant and has no place in the course. The tests were well-designed (grammatical errors aside), and despite no previous training in SQL, etc., none of the Database System Concepts & Design-relevant content was challenging. Even for functional dependencies, the course stops short of covering anything but the basics. \n\nNow for the bad: The administration for this course was a clown-car of dropped balls, misinformation, delays, and unprofessionalism, easily leap-frogging \"slapstick\" into \"piteous. \" No announcement or instructor response was free from substantive errors. No projected deadline for, say, feedback, was even close to adhered to. The rubric for the final project summed to 90%. \n\nA few weeks into the course, after an exam, someone asked on Piazza (an asynchronous medium) \"Would grades be curved? What is the % breakdown for scores for A, B, etc. ? Thanks\". The head TA, Terry \"Will J\" Johnson replied, \"Seriously? I'm fighting to get the grades uploaded, and they've been out for about 5 minutes, and you can't wait for me to finish before you start asking questions?\" That sort of emotional outburst and unprofessional behavior was common. People quickly stopped using Piazza for most questions, to avoid exposing themselves to that sort of thing. \n\nThis course was poorly-planned, poorly run, poorly organized, and had a significant focus on irrelevant material (thank goodness someone on our team knew PHP, that old mainstay of database design). I'm going to take my credits and my grade, reorient my schedule to steer clear of \"Will J, Head TA\", and traipse the hell away from this dumpster fire. I suggest you do likewise. Overall for somebody who does not have a formal CS background, I'm happy I took this as my first OMSCS course.  Although it is a database course, it broadly covers/requires other CS topics like web development, disk management, AMP setup and admin, PHP or Python scripting.  I would only recommend the course for students without much database development experience.  \n\nI am not a fan of the book.  You should get it for the course as a reference and for the exams but don't plan on keeping it.  \n\nThe exams are not difficult but are not easy to get an A.\n\nI like the concept of the project because it demonstrates \"putting it all together,\" but the Fall 2017 semester version was not well executed.  I think the TAs and instructors are taking feedback appropriately to improve it in future semesters. A great database class! Ignore those whiners.   Multiple choice open note tests. First two, browsed the book for about 2 hours in weeks before, printed notes, for A's (100 on the first test). Kind of let videos play while doing other things. Group projects w/ moderate amount of design documentation. The projects seem to be 6-8 hours of work for 4 people so far. Actually it's hard to divide up the projects because they are just too short for 4 people. It's as much effort to coordinate as it is to do the work and doesn't explore group techniques like SDP. More or less, we've all done all of the first 2 projects, and then just met to combine for the best answer. Easily one of the easier courses in the program, though there is a little interesting material and I hope the last section will be a little more involved. If you've never seen a database, there may be a bit of vocab to absorb. It has fostered some okay discussion; not as much as SDP did. You do need the book. Lectures are mostly project info & book summary.  I felt that a lot of the material was impractical and that the project was poorly planned and designed. I was expected a much deeper dive into the sql concepts but this class instead is aimed at people that don't know what a database is, which in my opinion should not be a graduate level class. If you have never taken a database class or used them then this class is for you, but if you have any real world experience I would not bother. I learned a great deal from this course. Most of the assignments were pretty easy. The group project was pretty massive on the other hand. For whatever reason, I was the only one on my team that had any Android experience and so I carried a bulk of the load. The part I hated the most about this class was that there was 0 peer review. So some people could cruise right through the group project, get the same grade as you, and not put in any work. Lectures were pretty boring for the most part. I haven't taken any database course before, and this course is very friendly to those students without a good cs background. Exams are easy and open-book. Projects are a little tricky. Group corporations are very important for projects. I definitely learned a lot about SQL, Html5, CSS, PHP, Javascript and Jquery in this course. I share no less pain and sympathy with all other comments toward the summer 2017 offering by J Summet and \"Head TA Will J. \". I agree with the poor course management experienced by other students. In fact, I am surprised to know my initial post about the comment was deleted here. The course is well organized and run; the professor changed Spring 2017 so the exam policies differed from previous comments (most were closed notes). This is really a database-driven/data model/SQL class, so it should be easy if you have experiences with LAMP or similar technologies, and quite a bit harder if you do not. \n\nMost of the workload is in the project, so the hours per week is not evenly distributed; there are no average weeks. You'll either work harder (when building the project) or not very much. This was a challenging class for me even though I've been developing with databases for years. The main reason for this is because some mostly academic topics are covered in depth such as query calculus and algebra. These were completely new topics for me. The rest though was pretty much the same you'd learn in any db class This is an intro to relational database and SQL. The first 2/3 of the semester is almost nothing. A few hours of watching lecture videos and reading books will assure a 90+ in exam 1~3. But the last month of the semester is relatively intense. I spent 50+ hours on final project, and 10+ hours to prepare for the final exam, which at least tripled the difficulty of previous exams. I was having lot of expectation from this course but I felt it is not organized properly plus the concepts were not explained that much in detail. My hope after taking the course was to write more complex queries but I don't feel that I gained anything in that area. Even some more light can be thrown towards database performance and storage. Though I enjoyed the ER concept taught in this class. But to me this class is for entry level, I would not suggest to take this class if you have idea about database and expecting much from it though you can go for this one if you want to complete electives. Best of luck :)   This was one of the best classes I have taken in terms of usefulness. Was slammed with a terrible group unfortunately so in the end I had some very late nights where the onus was mainly on me to get the project done. I had people in my group that almost did nothing so I can see how this gets a rating of not time consuming. Don't be fooled though, you may have an extremely time consuming project to do if your group is bad. very easy course, if you have previous experience on DB. the group project takes some time to coordinate but if you've got a good group it will be fine. Major task in this course is to build a DB backed website/software. tests are not hard, except for the final one. course materials are more on the conceptual side, than the practical side of database systems. I had previously build some websites and had some experience in MySQL, but I still learnt something from this course, especially the design methodology, and I really like it. Course material is a little out-dated as it doesn't address NoSQL databases. There's one project, which is a group project, in this class that consists of 3 phases: requirement gathering, documentation and implementation.\nThere are also 10 non-proctored quizzes, each worth 2% with no limit on the number of retries. 4 proctored, but open book, open notes (no internet access) tests. Too easy for a graduate level course. Much of the first half could be condensed into a 3-4 week review of normalization and data design rules. Would like to have seen the course expand more on indexing/performance strategies, modeling approaches to analytical systems vs transactional, and perhaps an intro to big data.  I love this course. I must say that I'm lucky to get a really great team. With our effort, I built my first application. There are 3 exams for summer semester. The first one and last one are tricky. The second one is all about SQL and it's straightforward. The content is really undergraduate introductory level. Mostly basic stuff. No in-depth content on any of the database implementations. Perhaps this is actually what the object is for this course. By the way, the final grading may not be lenient compared with other ones, and only 40% students get A, 50% students get B. So, this course may not be as \"EASY\" as you think in terms of grading.  This review comes after the third of four exams, and near the end of the final project. \n\nDr. Mark is straightforward and to-the-point in lectures. The textbook is readable. If you try taking the exams without having read the book, you will have a bad time. \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, this course is mostly review for experienced database developers. This course is deceptively easy. The material and concepts are not hard to grasp, but the exams have some subtle questions that might combine three or four little tidbits into one question. That's probably why the average exam scores have been in the 80's. \n\nFor this semester, there are three group projects. You're given a spec document, and must design and implement a database-backed application to satisfy the spec. The last of the three projects is implementation, and it feels like busywork. \n\nOverall, kudos to Dr. Mark and the TA's. This course was interesting, well-run, and not too difficult.  Course is like a review for experienced database developers. It might be tough for students with 0 knowledge as the Prof is very hands off. Group project is very documentation heavy. Make sure to get a good group.  Very little content, and the material is lighter than an undergraduate database introduction. They do not cover any advanced material. The project can be a bit of work, otherwise an uninteresting filler class. Tricky exams. The TAs/Instructor will never listen to any suggestion from students. Don't expect to learn much from this course. Very easy. So far the tests have been multiple choice with open book and open notes. As a result I have not read the book at all and just used the index to find the pertinent info that I hadn't learned from lectures. I have finished both exams with time to spare and have gotten 96% on both. The projects are also easy. They are something I could definitely do by myself (so far anyways) and seem to have been made group projects for the dual purpose of giving us experience working in groups and making grading easier.  This course structure is very easy and industry-oriented. Most exams are open-book / open-notes consisting of multiple-choice and True / False questions, and the difficulty level of the exams are not high enough. The lectures are quite insightful, but students are asked to read the text book in detail. Piazza student group is very active and helpful for this course.  The exam thing will not come outside of the lecture. At first I read a lot of book to prepare and then I just learned that all the stuff in exam is only from the lecture which saves me a lot of time to play overwatch. The course was challenging, but enjoyable. I did have a strong SQL background going into the course, so was familiar with a lot of the presented concepts already. The SQL calculus and algebra concepts were interesting, but gave a lot of people some headaches. The assignments themselves were straightforward but did require a significant amount of web coding knowledge - I had to learn python and Django on the fly. So make sure you choose your team mates very carefully. \nTests were straight forward but did require understanding of the lectures. The provided practice exams did give a good idea of what the exams would be like, as well as ideas for what areas to focus on for studying. Make sure to pick up the textbook also, it does help with understanding the presented concepts.", 
    "CS-6440": " One of the worst courses in this program even after the complete remake in Spring 2018. I would say the course is over ambitious in terms of scope. It attempts to cover many subjects within the area or US health system and standardization for interoperability. It feels like fitting 20 pounds of stuff into a 5 pounds bag. In the end, I did not get much out of it. In addition, the course lectures include many interview videos which are often lengthy but do not provide much academic values to the topic. The only reason I took it is because it is mandatory for the II specialization. Instructors may re-evaluate their choice of using HL7 v3 standard for the FHIR activity because there are limited examples available online. In terms of content, the course gives a good introduction to the topics without assuming any previous experience but still getting into a lot of the technical and logistical issues of US health IT systems. In this semester, there were no exams and in their place were a set of timed quizzes. The quizzes are open notes/lectures and follow the lecture content very closely, so for the most part the questions can be answered if the student watches and understands the lecture material. Most of the more challenging work in the course has to do with the semester-long group project, which involves creating a web application that uses heatlh data records. The very start of the semester and project was somewhat disorganized, because many changes were made at the last minute to switch from the previous version of the group project to a new group project involving FHIR web services. Originally the course material stated that groups could use any web platform/framework/programming language, then after many groups formed around experience with particular technologies it was announced that all groups needed to use Java/Tomcat in order to deploy to particular machines at Georgia Tech that have access to the proprietary health data. The final deployment machines and data are not accessible to students during development, and at the end of the semester students will submit their completed WAR app which will be run on the machines with the full data for the first time without giving students the opportunity to fix any bugs or issues related to deployment and using the new data. Other than those issues (which my group avoided by requesting and being granted approval to use our own servers and data) the project is a straight-forward web application group project. Groups are required to use the health data in some way but aside from that the project is very open-ended in terms of what students can focus on for their app. As with any OMSCS group project, the previous experience of students varies greatly within the class, with some students having almost no web development experience on one end of the spectrum and some having worked in the industry for 10+ years on the other end. The groups are self-selected rather than assigned by the instructors so the overall experience level of the groups can vary as well. The instructors are active on Piazza with regular announcement posts and answers to questions from students, although sometimes basic details of assignments such as length or format of presentations are announced close to the deadline. For students with no web development or Java experience at all, I would suggest learning some basic skills before taking this course, and the CS 6300 course in the OMSCS program is the closest in terms of an intro to those sorts of development skills. Otherwise any student should be able to succeed in this course and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the topics.  30% Quizzes\n20% Activities\n50% Project\n\nThe course is about a group project that delivers an app built on top of healthcare data accessible through RESTful FHIR APIs. Make sure to pick your group members carefully instead of randomly. With the right group members, your experience will be positive. With the wrong group members... well, you get the idea. \n\nThe quizzes and activities are open-book. Each multiple-choice/multiple-select quiz tests material from two lectures (10 lectures total). The two activities test your ability to interact with RESTful FHIR APIs and the FHIR data model. If you have any database experience or can think logically, they are a breeze. This class is very very easy. The lectures themselves are extremely boring, and I did not learn very much from them. I did have to do most of the development work on our group project BUT, since I did most of the work, I also feel like I learned the most about the FHIR API and how to use it and how some of the health data is structured. That was all really interesting to me. My biggest gripe about this course is that I feel the instructors are focused on assignments and grades... rather than students. Maybe it's because I was taking EduTech at the same time, but I felt like the instructors just LOVED taking points off for things like \"video was 30 seconds too long\" or \"Essay was too long\" (the essays are maximum 800 words - it is hard to sufficiently answer the questions without going over) or \"Wrong format submitted\" (even if the assignment guidelines were modified before the due date), etc.\n\nWe worked with an external mentor (a doctor in Atlanta, Georgia) on our project and he was very helpful and very responsive. It seems most of the External Mentors were really good. I wasn't a fan of our TA Mentor (for the aforementioned reasons), though. This is definitely one of the easier courses in the program in its current format. You work on a number of quick assignments, as well as 3 essays, but the bulk of the course is spent on a group project. Lectures are good but light on content, you're finished with them halfway through the course. The group project is teams made up of 4-6 people working on mostly pre-defined projects in the healthcare field. In most projects you work with a mentor who is in the healthcare field. As long as you're with a competent team the group project should be fairly manageable. This course would pair nicely with another course as its workload is light and you can balance around a lot of the work to fit your schedule.     This class could have been awesome. The content as presented in the lectures was very interesting. I really liked the idea of the group project, but I didn't like how loosely defined the grading rubric was. What troubles me most was the midterm. (Full disclosure, I scored an A on the mid term prior to curving it... this is not sour grapes. ) The midterm questions were poorly written and did nothing to test understanding. Instead they were multiple choice/choose all the apply type questions dealing with trivial details. It was stated prior to the test that it would only be over the first 5 lessons... but there were at least two topics that were covered in later sections that appeared on the test. Another disappointing aspect of this course was the 'Activities. ' There were 3 or 4 actions that students were expected to do using a 3rd party application. Halfway through the course, it was revealed that the instructors were not receving confirmation of our actions. So we had to go back, do the activities again, and provide screenshots. This was somewhat annoying, but I would not have minded as much if the activities contributed at all to my learning (which I felt they did not. ) Bottom line: Great content... poor class.  Very busy the last month or so of class and around the mid-term. Found the videos enjoyable. If you are interested in learning more about US Healthcare and how IT is becoming more involved then you will find the material enjoyable. I was able to confidently talk to my doctor and family friends who are doctors about healthcare in general after taking this class.  I agree with the gist of the previous comments but I found the midterm only mildly hard. I did find it annoyingly ambiguous and not consistent with what it was supposed to cover but I still scored nearly perfect before many of the questions were dropped. The project was VERY unrestricted and not too tough if you are either a web developer or are in a team w/ 1 or 2 strong web devs. The work load was light, even including the project work, as long as you do not have to learn the platform(s) your team chooses to write it in. The text book was helpful but at nearly $90 after shipping costs, not worth the money. If I did not get reimbursed by my employer for it, I would have been very annoyed with the cost vs. value.  Agree with entries #2 and #5 (Kyle's). Here are some addtional thoughts:\n\n1) Because the midterm only covered lessons 1 through 5 (out of 10 lessons) and there was no final, there was little motivation to learn the content from lessons 6 through 10 (other than a 5-minute activity from lesson 7). There was also no real motivation to read all the suggested extra material. We were never tested on any of it. \n\n2) TEXT BOOK : I purchased the 'text BOOK ', which the professor DOES say is optional. It was VERY overpriced ($79. 95, even though the professor mistakenly says that students will be able to get the discounted price of $64. 95, which is STILL overpriced). For the price, it\u2019s closer to the size of a PAMPHLET than a text BOOK !! I was very shocked when it came in the mail!\n\nDespite being overpriced, the lectures ARE based on the book content, so the book does indeed provide a solid foundation to the videos. It helped me a LITTLE with the midterm, but after the unfair/ambiguous/subjective questions on the midterm I probably would have done fine without the BOOK. \n\nDespite these kinks, I will say that Prof. Mark and TA Shan are very knowledgeable and responsive to concerns.  ***This review is for Fall 2017***\n\nI really do not like this class. I regret taking it. Half of the class consists of short assignments, quizzes, and three essays which all have a hard word limit of 800 words, so you can't really go into depth for any of them. I felt like I didn't learn much through writing them because of this--I just scratched the surface of the topics. The only assignments that I feel like I benefitted from were a series of FHIR activities where we had to work with Java and perform various tasks with a FHIR database. It was a good crash corse in actually using FHIR. You could probably learn more from this course if you spend more time and did all the optional readings, but you could learn just as much independently, using google to find articles and information. I got 100% on everything so far, and I'd be surprised if anyone didn't. \n\nThe second half of the class is a group project. You form groups or 4-6 and then can choose projects from a list provided. You rank your choices in order of preference and then you get what you get. You *are* allowed to think up your own project, but it is discouraged. Our group got one of our last choices, and it wasn't one I was even interested in, which made it very difficult to dedicate a lot of time to it. The project also ended up being quite different than we originally thought. You work with external \"mentors\" from various places like medical institutions, the CDC, etc, on the project. Many of the mentors are busy and don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as your group may need, so it can be difficult to get feedback from them or schedule phone calls. The group project also requires weekly status reports and quite a few powerpoint presentations, which took time to put together. I felt like this time could have been better used actually working on the project. Your grade is basically determined by how you do on the project, which highly depends on which project you end up with. This class was fairly straightforward when I took it, but I ended up spending so much time on the class project due to my teammates not pulling their weights. Content wise, it was very light, and so I decided to buy two books authored by the professor and read them from cover to cover because I was interested in health informatics. I would suggest picking up the books to maximize your learning in this class, and pick your group members wisely. The material is very interesting. The professor and TA Team are passionate and helpful. Class Piazza Participation is great. As mentioned in the previous reviews, the FHIR activities were pretty interesting and provide hands on knowledge on using APIS accessing FHIR database. The recommended readings provide good background on the topics covered. Would have been better if the team project weight is reduced from the current 35% because the team performance matters a lot in delivering a quality project. This class had some serious issue for me. The lectures were easily the best part. They were well presented and I learned a lot from them. The quizzes were open book so you could easily download the transcripts and ack through them to get the answers easier. \n\nThe group project was easily the worst aspect of this class. My group was very unequal in the amount of work done by each member and the TAs did nothing to remedy this throughout the semester. Furthermore the TAs were often late to respond and not helpful. I had one occasion where I asked a question 3 days prior to deadline for a major project and the TA responded 2 days after the project was due. If you already have a group of people for your project this class could be good and easy, but with the unequal work amongst the group it can be very hard for the people who are doing all the work on the project.  As many others have stated, this class is poorly run with bad communication and inadequate assessment. I had the benefit of a great group for the project, but without that bonus I would have found this class highly frustrating. That said, the basic HIT concepts under discussion are important and interesting. I'm glad I was exposed to them, even in such a suboptimal fashion.  This is an easy class if you have a good group for the final project that is worth 50% of your grade. Quizzes are pretty easy if you take good notes for the lectures. Double check to make sure the answers are correct. Several answers on several quizzes were counted wrong but they were correct.  This course is not hard if you get a good group. The instruction though is disjointed so thats why I say somewhat easy What you are supposed to be working on is not 100% clear. Not everything works. They put a VPN on a server and then noone was able to access it to finish projects. Very confusing Course and not in a good way. Didnt learn too much and was just frustrating For spring 2015 this was a fairly easy course, and the principal factors in getting a good grade were memorizing content from the lectures to answer the obtuse quiz questions, and actually creating a healthcare web app with little to no requirements/guidance/criteria. I found it useful for understanding some basic health terms I didn't understand before. There is also huge potential for healthcare/tech startups, which the course did a good job of introducing.  I will reiterate what others said, in that the course is good if you get a good group. The lectures are easy to understand and the quizzes are really quite easy if you have viewed the lectures and have the transcripts readily available. Group selection was a disorganized and chaotic process with no real guidance from the instructors. Having lucked into a very good group, I would definitely advise you look for the obvious technical skills, java and html/js/css, but also given the large volume of presentations involved and the open-ended requirements, I would also seek out members with project management and technical writing experience so that you have presentation quality that adequately reflects the quality of your application.  Yes, this class is an easy A. Yes, this class had some major communication problems. \n\nThat said, I loved this class. I have many, many years in the informatics field. This course exposed me to many amazing ideas and technologies I'd never heard of. \n\nI also had an amazing team; our group project could easily be turned into a startup. \n\nI certainly understand why many folk may not like this class. In my case, it was an absolute joy that greatly boosted my self-confidence and had a substantial impact on my career.  This course is a pretty easy 3 credits in my opinion, assuming that you're in a decent group for the project. The lectures are intended for a broad audience and are not very technical. They are also shorter and less numerous than the other courses I've taken. They include lots of interviews with industry people which is somewhat refreshing. Although the prof. often writes somewhat strange/debatable mutliple choice questions, the quizzes are generally easy if you watched the corresponding lectures recently. The project was open-ended (and initially somewhat undefined) and we were tasked with forming our own teams. The projects are either web or mobile apps so it's important that some of your team members have those skills. Upfront work identifying a good team and project will result in a smooth semester.  Definitely an easy course if you're familiar with web development and fluent in at least any web based language (preferably JavaScript, HTML for client and Java for server). The lectures are really good and include lectures. You shouldn't have a problem with that. There was no Midterm nor Final this semester but I can't say it will happen again. Just make sure to read quiz questions carefully and watch lectures thoroughly and start your team project earlier and stay organized with it. This should be an easy A if you're team works well together.  Agree with the comments above. Not too much instructor involvement.  I do not recommend this class. Piazza boards are flooded with people looking for clarification, and very few will receive answers. The quizzes are filled with ambiguous questions. The professor expects the class to run on autopilot. This semester we used the FHIR api. FHIR is a living nightmare to work with.  This class was an embarassment, completely inappropriate for an MS program. At first the videos were annoying, as the guy talks at around 5 wpm. Then I realized you can run it on fast-forward. Even 2x feels slow. Then I realized there is no need to watch the videos at all. \n\nEvaluation is based on 10 open- BOOK quizzes. Simply searching the transcripts for keywords is sufficient. You have to be careful, as they try to trick you with double and triple negatives, but there's no real difficult questions\n\nThe only other evaluation is the final project. A touch of HTML and a JS template, total of about 3 hours of work. \n\nThere were many other problems in the class, from the absent Professor to varying requirements, but no real learning happened here. \n\nThe Professor did send out a couple emails strongly suggesting people buy his $80 ' BOOK ' (really just a pamphlet), but it is completely unnecssary for the course, feels like just a money grab.  This is hands down the worst class I have ever taken including undergrad, other online courses, and other post graduate classes. This course should not be in a graduate program let alone a top 10 one. \n\nIf you enjoy watching videos of someone slowly reading jargon about bureaucratic red-tape off a teleprompter, busy work with instructions so vague and undirected you'll want to gouge your eyes out, an absent teacher and TA presence, and not actually learning anything of substance then this is the course for you. This comes from someone who is very interested in health informatics and lucked out and got a good group! I am upset I paid money for this course. Do yourself a favor and skip the potentially easy grade and take a course that actually teaches you something. The program is full of them and its well worth it.  The class lectures are informative and are generally an overview of the various topics presented throughout the course. No lectures really go all that in-depth on a particular subject though so it's more of a generalized view of informatics in the healthcare industry. There was a quiz every two weeks up until about 2/3 of the way through the course. At that point you're expected to work on the group project. The quizes questions for the most part were not very difficult if you paid attention to the lectures and used common sense; however, some of the questions were ambiguous at best and others downright confusing. \n\nWhat I found to be the most disappointing was the group project. Spring 2015 was the first semester they tried to use the GT FHIR server and it did not go well. Between the server constantly being under development, server connectivity problems, VPN problems, and a whole lot of other issues the project was a real pain for many groups. Our group decided fairly early on to abandon the GT FHIR server in favor of the more stable, public SPARK FHIR server and that turned out to be a good idea looking back on all the issues other groups were having. I felt our issues that we had to work through with our chosen server were relatively minor in comparison. \n\nGroup selection was an annoying issue with the course too. It look a couple weeks for everyone to find a group to join. The group I formed had a couple people express interest in joining only to find out they were apparently 'shopping' for the best group. The TAs sent out multiple requests trying to find groups for people to join as well. Also we didn't get to peer review our group members which was disappointing. The reason I say this class is Somewhat Easy is because the issues with the group project made it harder than it should have been.  I'm actually enjoying covering the material in this class because I had no previous knowledge of what is going on behind the scenes in the healthcare industry. The group project is kind of a nightmare though as I'm not too good with open-ended projects and my lack of topic knowledge is a bit of a barrier. The class could be run a bit better, but it is not all bad. I see lots of interaction on Piazza between the students and the TA's. Also, the professor does pop in the forum from time to time. I think the problems this class is experiencing stem from the fact that the prof is trying to keep the class up to date, so there is some churn in the material. Not a bad class at all. Assignments are spread out over the semester, so some weeks there is nothing to do (well, we are supposed to be working on our project). When there is an assigment, reading or otherwise takes a few hours in addition to the quizzes. This semester, we had one (1) try at taking each quiz. You do have to think/know the material to get it right. Oh, and be careful if you know healthcare already, because your definitions might not match those presented in the class and using your definitions on the quizzes will be counted wrong (this happened to several people). So, make sure you study! Agree completely with entry 2 (except there was no final) and Kyle (entry 5). Off-camera I found prof frustrating, illogical, error-prone, even dishonest about these, and i wil complain again when semester is over.  It's hard to make a call on the class because there's only a midterm, final and project. The 'lecture activities' are 5 minutes, tops. It's a cursory examination of the material and is interesting, especially if you've had no exposure to HIT and the problems of interoperability and data formats. The lectures have a fair number of interviews with industry leaders, which is nice to see. I scored nearly perfectly, but the Mid term grading upset a lot of people (1/4 of the questions were thrown out for being poorly written). It was probably one of the worst designed tests I've taken in terms of judging a student's grasp of the material. It's also hard to predict how well you will do, given that 50% of your grade is unknown until the final week of the course (a semester-long group project with VERY loose specifications). If you are interested in HIT and maybe a bit of an exploratory fun project, it's not bad. The workload is minimal outside project work, and it pairs pretty well with a harder course in the same semester. I went many weeks doing no work at all beyond lecture watching.  I loved this course because it offered a view into a huge field that I was unfamiliar with, and showed just how much of the field could stand to benefit from technology. The essays were a bit high level considering they have a low word count requirement, and the group project can be hit or miss depending on the team sponsor/mentor, but this is one of those courses where a student can get a lot out of it if they are curious about the healthcare industry and willing to put in extra effort. Unfortunately, this class is pretty much a failure. \n\nOne major problem (and certainly not the least of the problems) is that the course staff is completely disorganized. Nearly every single assignment due date has been revised once or twice. The staff acts as if this is a favor to the students to keep pushing out the dates, but it makes it extremely hard to know what's going on with the course. On top of that, they promise that assignments and documents will be released by certain dates and VERY consistently actually release them several days later (and often push the due dates out in response). \n\nThe lectures are fine. They do a pretty good job of covering the current healthcare situation in the US and different IT solutions/problems to these. Every 2-3 weeks another little quiz is due that tests whether or not you've watched the lectures - I can mostly ignore these until they're due, watch the group of lectures on fast forward in less than an hour, and then take the (open book/notes) quiz using the lecture transcripts for reference. The amount of useful knowledge I feel like I gain from the lectures is minimal. \n\nThe project is ill-defined and we have been able to receive little useful feedback from the assigned TA. It doesn't help anything that the grades and feedback for each assigned deliverable is extremely late (you get feedback from the last assignment nearly by the time the next one is due) and not-at-all detailed. It's hard to know if the project is going in a reasonable direction for a solid grade. *shrug* I guess we'll see. \n\nThere was supposed to be some interesting programming exercises for working with FHIR. This was updated to be some quizzes instead. Apparently, they thought the Masters Computer Science students were too incompetent to figure out some programming exercises. \n\nGaTech really needs to reevaluate this one... Take this one if it's required or if you need easy credits. Don't expect that you'll get much out of it though.  This is one of my first courses. I really liked the course. The professor was so full of energy in the videos. The essays were fun to write. I spent a lot of time reading, and rereading, and reading the external material. Spend the time to watch the videos and write well-crafted essays. TA's will reward you with extra credit. I think they read so many essays, they can tell the difference between those who spent the time learning the stuff and who's just bs-ing their way through. I highly recommend the course! The Health Technology background is useful, the class has minimal technology training, the real-world project is the saving grace that made the class worth taking.\n\nThe lecture videos are the worst of any OMSCS class I've taken.  They are mostly the instructor speaking with no use of visual aids or poorly edited interviews with people in the health field.  The class was very disorganized with many poorly communicated corrections and changes through the semester.  There is almost no teaching on the actual technology beyond basic concepts and logical architecture of FHIR.  The activities are rudimentary and don't provide much benefit other than following directions and using trial and error to get things working.  The essays focused more on references than content.\n\nThe workload week to week was very inconsistent.  One week would be 10+ hours and the next might be 3.\n\nThe real-world group project for the class was rewarding and I learned a lot from that.  I would have preferred to start it much earlier and remove a lot of the extra unneeded lectures / interviews. Okay, so this class had some great things and some really bad things. The professor was enthusiastic and presented some interesting material. He not having a CS background had a tendency to spend to much time explaining fairly simple concepts. This was reflected in the early assignments too. Generally, people are correct that this can be an easy A. However, if you end up with a bad group this class can be extremely time consuming. I ended up spending an enormous amount of extra time coding this as a few team members did very little and one did absolutely nothing until the day it was due. Due to it, our project ended up being way less than it should have been and felt that our TA was pretty nice to us given the circumstances. With that said I put a ton of hours into it and was very frustrated with how it turned out because of this. Still did get an A which makes me feel a bit better about this but in some ways not happy that the guy who did almost nothing probably also got an A. The last four weeks I was putting in 20+ hours a week. Overall, I regret taking this class. The material is relevant to the job and research market, but it is terribly presented. Still, I would be able to appreciate the time and effort the videos and organization of material must have taken, but there is nothing to back this learning up. The assignments and quizzes are a joke - just testing rote memory from the lectures - and the phrasing is terrible. There is very little guidance provided for the open ended group project, and instructors and TAs are slow to respond, if at all. I enjoyed my group and learned from the process because we took initiative to push ourselves. It's an easy 3 credits, but I'd rather have spent my money on a better run class and read up on these topics on my own.  Take this class when you need a breather, but do not expect it to be well organized :)\n\nThey setup a database for us to run queries against and answer quiz questions, but did not make it readonly. Some of the tasks required us to make updates to it, which ruined it for future test takers. They eventually figured it out, but it caused issues for several students. We are supposed to sent an email through Microsoft HealthVault and the receiving inbox only works some of the time. There was supposed to be Peer Feedback, but that requirement has been removed. 50% of the class grade is a group project to which you receive only very scarce feedback. Make sure to find a group with somebody who makes awesome Power Points! I have been writing code off and on for about 8 weeks and the only things that we have turned in are Power Points. They are only now asking for a 'tiny' demo, so I am skeptical as to how much of the code and or functionality they will actually review. None-the-less, I want to make sure my group has a somewhat functional program. \n\nP. S. You do *NOT* need to buy the supplemental reading in order to score high on the quizzes. The subject material is completely based off the lectures and transcripts are available to download for free.  This course has a lot of small activities (every week there is something to do). The programming activities are interesting but not challenging (the difficulty was mostly understanding the question, other than that they were very straightforward). There are 3 essays with a max of 800 words which does not allow to go deep into the subjects. \n\nIt also has a project which will depend mainly on who is in your group (so you do not end up doing most of the work) and the selected project (you can create your own one but it is preferred that you choose one from a list). \n\nHonestly with a good group of people on your project team and dedicating a short time every week you can get a good grade easily. \n\nBeing this my 7th course I can say that this has been the easiest so far. Pros: Overall well run. I work in Healthcare IT and found class useful. Easy workload, makes a good candidate to pair up with another class.\nCons: Subject matter is very boring and videos are dry.  As others have stated very easy class with interesting lectures. If you want to gain something from this class it will be either from the lectures or from the project you decide to work on with your group. That being said it wouldn't be far fetched for this class to receive some sort or rework or restructure in the future This course was very easy , to me,it  didn't meet the expectations of a grad level class. It felt more like a freshman level class in undergrad. We were provided with basic level exercises that were somewhat tricky but doable without too much effort. You do get to learn the high level  concepts in  health IT through lectures,and we have to write three essays through out the course. Lastly,  the course project is the main part of the class,which is somewhat interesting, but risky because you might get teamed up with students around the world,with varying time zones making it really difficult to collaborate.  Extremely easy class. Virtually no work, but also no information.  What a disaster. I can't even. This class had no rigor whatsoever and the course stuff ran it extremely poorly. Just for example - a major project of the class (The \"FHIR Activity\") was supposed to be a programming project. It ended up being 10 question, open-book quiz on t-square (that we could take as many times as possible and receive the highest grade), that was worth 15% of our grades. I took it 4 times in about 30 minutes with the reading material in front of me and got a 100% on it. \n\nI don't think even one assignment avoided having its due date changed. The course stuff repeatedly promised assignment materials by a certain date, and then consistently released them a week+ later and then changed the due date to compensate (and consequently acted like they were doing everybody a favor). \n\nThe lecture material was somewhat interesting, but there was literally only several hours of lectures total. \n\nThis class was an easy A at least. Don't bother with it unless that's what you're looking for or if you already have a great project idea that you want to explore with a group.  This class was the worst class I've ever taken in person or online. The only redeeming factor was getting an A. However, if this was my first course in the program I probably would not have continued. It is very easy, but if your group project isn't an enjoyable experience, you will probably hate this class. If you're not planning on the Interactive Intelligence specialization, don't take this class. Even if you are in II, you may want to wait and take Computational Journalism. The only redeeming quality of this class was the lectures. Everything else was trying to fit 20 lbs of work into a 5 lb bag. The lead TA for the class, deliberately or not, has a habit of talking down to everyone. For a graduate level course, it's really uncalled for and, outside of a kindergarten classroom, not conducive to learning. \n\nAssignments were a mess, with deadlines sometimes jumping, but always being very short (sometimes in the course of less than 4 days). If you are expecting a class where you can get caught up on weekends, this is not the course to take. It also didn't help for early assignments that the FHIR server used for the class would get overloaded, especially on weekends, preventing students from getting work done. \n\nTack on to that \"engagement\" exercises that were really more like busy work. If you like taking HR engagement surveys, there will be quite a few of them in this course. You also need to provide weekly status updates (which aren't too bad). These aren't as much of a hassle once you've gotten through all the lectures, but it's a pain to juggle early on in the course. \n\nI'm not surprised this course is not being offered in the near future - logistically it is a nightmare, and with the new presidential administration, healthcare in the US will be changing. The topics this course covers now could be ancient history a year from now. Pros: Interesting material! Since it's a domain-specific course (focused on healthcare), we're constantly exposed to real-world applications of the technology. This includes current and historical challenges, and new opportunities. The course incorporates a fun group project working with an external mentor (from the healthcare industry) to create a FHIR app that might actually turn into something. (I cringe at all the throwaway code I write for an OMSCS course, so this was a refreshing change.) The TAs are super responsive and I was delighted how fast the assignment grades came back!\n\nCons: This semester the course has been significantly reworked. The lectures are new and autograded activities have been created from scratch. There were a few hiccups with the activities, but the TAs were always quite responsive and graded generously in these situations.\n\nMisc.: Students are expected to write numerous short-form essays (200-400 words), citing sources using APA format. This was new to most of us, and the TAs were helpful in getting us familiar with it. The autograded activities required Java code written to interface with a FHIR server. If you're learning Java while also learning the FHIR API, expect a few weeks of pain. Really easy class. I didn't watch any videos. Essay and assignment take 1 hour to finish. The group project is a simple demo. A good class to pair with the hard ones. ", 
    "CS-6460": " I'm pretty much echoing the other comments. This course is different than the typical OMSCS course (It was my 7th one, for basis of comparison). It is unstructured in the sense that there are not formal video lectures throughout [there are several introductory videos from Dr. Joyner on Udacity you'll watch in the first week, but that's it and even those are informal]. The rest of the course involves researching educational technology and proposing a project which you'll then complete while working with an assigned mentor. However, it is structured in the sense that you'll be guided through a series of objectives and milestones along the way. Discussion on Piazza plays a big part too... basically every day, there'll be some suggested topic to discuss or debate, although everyone is encouraged to ask questions, share articles or other interesting content they've found and just generally join in much as you would in a traditional seminar course. The TAs and Professor were extremely responsive and involved, but they also managed to stay out of the way and avoid micromanaging. The style of individual mentors varies as you'd expect but they make an attempt to match you up for a good fit and I had no problems working with mine. Finally, peer reviews are also included.... my impression of the utility of those was mixed. In all cases, various sorts of 'participation' are acknowledged and form part of your final grade. At the beginning, you'll probably wonder \"What have I go myself into ?\" but before long you'll find yourself fitting into the flow just fine. Your communication skills will definitely be exercised... there are weekly essays prior to actually beginning the project phase, milestone & progress reports, a final project video presentation, and a final project paper suitable for publication. Time management is also important, particularly in the compressed summer semester. Bottom line --- you'll get out of it what you put into it. This is a very easy class. It's self-paced so if you are able to manage your own self and capable of coming up with stuff to do and do those things you come up with, then you will do well in the class. I think I got 100% on everything. It requires a lot of writing and checking in every week with your TA to let them know how you are progressing. I would recommend this class to only those who are interested in starting a business after they are done with the masters or to those who may be interested in doing PhD after the masters. The reason why is because if you want to start a business, you can get the ground work done in this class - have an app you want to build or software for something related to education (and education is really being used light here) this is the class for you. Have a cool research idea you want to research and maybe do a PhD on, this is the class for you to learn how to go about doing that in the next level and also get some serious research done.  In this class, you choose your own project, which can either be an educational tool or a research study. You don't need to have a project in mind before starting the class but since all the activities since week two are directed towards researching your problem space, you'll need to land on one pretty quickly. Alternatively, you can join someone else's project, which I'd probably recommend even if you have your own idea. With more people on the team, you can combine your efforts, build something more polished, and have more fun along the way. Otherwise, despite encouraging feedback from peer reviews, you might feel a little lonely in your one-man-project. \n\nDuring the first 5 weeks, there will be a short (~500 words) written submission documenting your research every week, followed by project proposal. In the next 8 weeks, you'll be working on the project, summarizing your progress in a short text or video recording every other week. In the final two weeks, you will combine all your previous notes and research to write an academic paper in a format and quality to be presented at a scientific conference. You don't have to officially submit it but even without doing so, you'll have gone through the entire process of researching a topic, identifiying a problem, designing a solution, and writing a paper about it. \n\nThe structure of the course is very free-form. There are no common videos or texts to read -- instead, you'll be expected to do your own research (i. e. find relevant papers, learn tools you want to use). There is a suggested breakdown of how much time you should spend on research/review/writing/programming in a given week (~10h/w total), but the actual content varies for each student. The plus side is, you'll be assigned a mentor who will guide you on your journey. And if you've known David Joyner for a while, you can be sure he'll post weekly plan and summary announcements, daily discussion threads, and reply to almost every comment.  Very self driven class. The entire class is working towards a single project and presentation at the end of the semester. The video content is very limited and is essentially just a tour of the course catalog and what the different categories are.\nThe class is certainly what you make of it, the instructors aren't really looking over your shoulder. I'm sure they would be helpful if you asked them direct questions, but they didn't seem to have much input for any given weekly checkin.\nIt'd be great if there was some way to encourage more group participation, the peer feedback is a great tool, but working directly with classmates would allow teams to have cooler and larger-scoped projects. This course was a fun course, I would recommend to anyone who is interested in working on a project/projects. That said, it involves is a lot of writing but it gets all connected to the end project and you will appreciate it in the end when you see the results of your hard work in the end. Dr Joyner is great, the class was well organized and documentation is spectacular, second to none. This is a class structured as a PhD, where there are no lectures and you decide how hard it will get. It's very possible to ace this class if you're motivated enough. \n\nSince you choose your own project or research, pretty much anybody can relate to a project that concerns Educational Technology. \n\nHere are some examples of projects: Music teaching tools, sign language SW, anti plagiarism tools, identity verification, group interaction tools, AI for pretty much anything, k12 and STEM involvement, safety and security, assessment tools, and the list goes on and on.  A self-driven class where you get out of the class what you put in. You explore areas of educational technology at the start of the class and then propose a project you would like to do. Communication is excellent throughout the course. The mentors are helpful, and everyone encourages you as you explore, define, and create your mini PhD project.\n\nI wish I would have had more time to explore other project proposals to join a group. There's some opportunity to do that by looking through the library and peer-reviewing projects, but you need to make time for it. Really recommend doing that if you take the course because you might find something you hadn't thought about or that captures your interest more.\n\nI'd recommend taking this course towards the end of OMSCS as you might have acquired some new skills that you'd like to apply to an EdTech development project. Such a great class either way! Kudos to David Joyner and the awesome mentors in that class. I loved this class and wish more courses followed this format! It's an almost completely open-ended class where you propose a project and then work on it throughout the course. The professor and TAs are good about making sure you know the expectations for the class, that you keep your scope for you project reasonable, and that you are roughly on track throughout the course. If you prefer a more structured course, you may not enjoy this course, however if you like to work on a project that interests you personally and have a ton of creative control then you will enjoy this class. \n\nI would suggest having a rough idea of what you would like to do for the project going into the course. However if you aren't sure, educational technology is a pretty broad field and the first few weeks are spent researching various topics in the field to help you brainstorm ideas. \n\nAs far as grading and workload, the expectation is that the scope of the project itself will be about 100 hours. This amounts to 10-15 hours of work each week. You should be able to earn an 'A' if you put in the time and communicate your progress (even if you end up behind your original schedule). Difficulty is really how familiar you are with the work you do for the project, and since you choose what to work on you can control how much you want to branch out there. \n\nTaking this course over the Summer is tougher but do-able, you are looking at a few extra hours a week due to tighter timelines. Had the option of working with team or individual, I selected to work as individual and although the research was, well, it was research, the outcome and process of creating a research project was fun. This was my first OMSCS class after joining the program. We worked on a semester-long project, where we had the option to work individually or in groups, on a development or a research project -- I worked individually on a research paper. Definitely suggest honing your time management skills for this course, but overall a great class! Requires writing/reading and peer-reviewing every week. You are free to choose your topic, project to work on ; however be concise on what you want to do with your project. The whole course will based on your decision of topic choice, and final delivery is either your research paper or application about Education Technology. This course is really open , your final grade is based on what you have done in the project as a part of learning process , not the outcome or feasibility of your project.  Rating: \nThis is wonderful class that I was skeptical about but ended up loving. The course is compared to a PHD in structure, not necessarily rigor, and I learned a lot about the academic development process. The strongest aspect is this class is the organization and communication which is led by Dr. Joyner. His planning makes it very easy to focus on the content of the course and if you do have questions, answers are swift and sincere. The format is unique in that you are assigned a mentor who guides you through the process of deciding on a project and fulfilling the requirements. There aren't any strong negatives in the course but I suppose the initial project dive is a little rough. There is just so much data to sort through and it is a little hard to pick the problem you want to solve. Fortunately, if you come in to the program with a problem in mind this is a non-issue!\n\nDifficulty:\nThis class is what you make of it. You could pick an really easy problem or a really hard problem, the only person you're hurting or helping is yourself.The first few assignments are almost entirely reading academic articles so get good at reading those efficiently. The writing is not that hard as long as you stay on point and have a purpose. My initial project idea was too ambitious but I was able to massage it into something that could be completed in about 100 hours which is the goal. \n\nWorkload:\nI spent a lot of time reading throughout the entire course so that never really goes away. The last 4 weeks was my big dev cycle and I ended up pouring about 25/hrs in the last week or so. My measured average is about 10 and if I had not been taking a second class, I probably would not have had the huge uptick in hours during the last week. For the most part this class is what you make of it. It is possible to say that the hardest part of the class is the beginning where you are deciding what you want your project to be. There is consistent writing along with consistent feedback. For me the pressure of finding a project topic was a little over whelming. \n\nOnce you decide on your project, it may feel easier since you have probably chosen something you at least enjoy doing. Don't get me wrong though, you are definitely expected to challenge yourself and follow through. The TAs and professor set a high bar and make sure you reach for it. \n\nOverall a great class and very well run.  This is probably the most interesting class I've taken in the program.   it requires either a resource, content or development of educational technology.   I didn't know what I wanted to do prior to taking this classes, but as I started doing research, I got a great sense of what to do.   This is a work at your own pace, but keep up class.   It does require somewhere between 12 and 15 hours per work a week.   There several large papers and smaller papers.   If you pick an interesting topic you end up loving this class.    I want to continue to develop my idea and maybe leverage it back to OMS or other educational programs.    It's a truly great experience and I highly recommend this class.  This course was my introduction to the OMSCS program and I felt it was a good transition from professional life back into school life. The course is very much what you make of it and most of you will enjoy the freedom granted in the final project. The first half is very heavy in writing where you are exploring a topic of interest then you get into your project. You can choose to either work individually or work with a group. The freedom in project allows you to create something meaningful; I will continue the work that I started this semester after the conclusion of the semester because I believe in the value of what I got started.\n\nI highly recommend this course! This class is unique. It is great to learn how to do research and construct a research thesis. I learned a lot of project management skills also that I feel will be great in the work field. All the deliverables are stated and guide you through it. If you have an idea for a project or a business this will force you to follow it through and a mentor will guide you.  I had no ed tech experience and I learned so much since at the beginning I had no idea for a topic so I researched many fields prior to narrowing in on a project idea. The class  is definitely what you make of it. Great for independent learners. Good course if you are self-driven. There is no specific syllabus and sky is the limit. Chose a topic and explore and build a tool/ application or do research. Education is something we have all gone through and are continuously doing and changing education landscape should be of interest for almost everybody. \n\nBased on what I understand, you are judged on what you do - not how brilliant your idea is. And that is a good thing for most part. \n\nThe course is divided into multiple questions/ milestones and you should know if you have gone of track. Try to keep yourself on track - for getting grade \"A\" - the margin for error is not very high. \n\nAnother plus for this course: if you have made a mistake - you can simply request your mentor (TA) to correct it. You can focus on ideas and innovation and not worry about typos and losing points.  This class can't really be described too easily. For me, I have thought that this class was easy but at the same time it has taken a good amount of work. The gist is that you research topics that you find interesting and your goal is to come out with some kind of proposal for a tool, a paper, or research.. something along those lines, and then you complete your project. The sky is the limit on this one. If you know how to do what you want to do.. then you shoudln't have a problem in this class. David isn't silly with participation in that it is some hidden secret. He will let you know if you need to participate more. This is also the only class that so far has really made sense for peer review. Some of the other classes could have just not used it and I think it would have been fine. CP for one. Basically if you are fine working mostly on your own with guidance from a mentor, then this class is for you. If you need absolute structure, then this class is not for you.  I put the difficulty and workload at average levels, but it is really up to you. The course is an exploration of education technology in whichever direction you wish to go in the space. There are a number of quicky videos and a growing library to help you decide if you don't come in already with some ideas. The course has a number of short essays due weekly that step you through the process of identifying an area of interest, reviewing existing research, and scoping a research project or development tool project for the remainder of the semester. The project is formalized with a Proposal that includes weekly milestones and some progress deliverables prior to the final completed project. Along the way, your progress is monitored by a single 'mentor' (TA) that is there to answer questions and ensure that your are on track, scoped correctly, etc. An important component of the class is participation, which includes giving and getting peer feedback along the way with each of the essays. The students are encouraged to participate in daily discussions on Piazza which follow a weekly pattern... 'What did you learn?', 'Q&A with ??', 'Let's discuss +/- of an existing OMS course', etc. The instructor is Dr. David Joyner, of KBAI fame, and he is extremely active on Piazza, keeping the class lively and engaged, which is no mean feat since we are all doing different projects. The final coursework is not done, so I can't comment here how it will all end, but so far it is a joy to be part of this particular environment. It is different from other courses. There are still deliverables and the process is part of the course, but the project or research area is open-ended and up to the student to design.  If you are familiar with how Dr. Joyner runs a class (7637 KBAI), then you will know how this class will work. Weekly written assignments, peer feedback and a very active and well managed piazza forum. Grading is non-typical: Doesn't meet expectations, meets expectations, exceeds expectations. If you need an exact scale to feel comfortable about your grade, this may not be the course for you. A significant amount of your mark is based on your project (group or single - your choice), which is due at the end of the semester. So yes, you are in complete control of your grade, but you won't know what it is until that project is in. \n\nOne person likened the course structure to that of a mini-thesis, and that describes the course very well. \n\nI am really enjoying this course, but it isn't for everyone.  This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. You spend the first few weeks figuring out which areas you're interested in, and the remainder of the semester is spent putting your project together. Those first few weeks are very important as they will change the complexion of your experience in the course depending on what you choose. I worked on a team, and I think that is the best way to approach this class. You have other students that are holding you accountable and that are dependent upon you to get a good grade. You can do the project individually if you'd like (most people did, but I wanted a bigger project). It is also worth noting that you have one TA in this course - your mentor. So if you have any questions or want to know what to do to succeed, you have one person you can ask. In my opinion, this made it much easier because you're not getting conflicting information or trying to juggle multiple people's expectations. It is also much easier to get answers to your questions because one TA isn't trying to answer all of the questions - just their group of students' questions. A class that rewards hard work and is really oriented around you persuing something you're interested it. This was a very different type of class - only one week of lectures and the rest of it were projects. Probably shouldn't be taken your first semester or two. I loved this class. Choose a project (content, development, or research) that you are truly interested in and the semester will fly by. Ask questions of your TA/mentor, they seem genuinely there to help. It is difficult to assign a number of work hours per week. Some weeks only required a few hours of research and peer feedback, however other weeks required many more hours to pull an assignment together (especially the final project deliverable). Almost everything is self-paced, so be sure to have your calendar out and set reasonable milestones at the start of the project. Dr. Joyner and the TAs were fantastic. As with many previous comments, this class is really about how much you put into it. The grading is very generous and it's really easy to get grades from participation. Participation points literally rains on you from the surveys, Piazza participation, and even peer feedback (similar to KBAI). A side effect of this is that some of the peer feedback you get is pretty much generic. There are some really useful ones though so keep an eye on that. \n\nThe class's Piazza is really active and Dr. Joyner is quick to reply there and on Slack as well. Your mentor may be a hit or miss. My first mentor was great and we had lots of discussions on my research topic at the time. If you form a group, you get assigned a new mentor and that's usually the mentor that most group members have (if there's one or is random otherwise). My group's mentor was really hands off (as in I actually got 1 personal communication the entire time he was assigned). We didn't hear much from him throughout the entire project and our team's grades was always late. \n\nThe class allows you to research/work on a project that you want as long as its related to ed tech in some sense. There were some really interesting projects and I believe group work here helps a lot. While most of the time group projects are kind of a bane, this is one of the classes where it can really help you come up with something that you'll never be able to going at it alone. Just MAKE sure that your group mates are as interested in the idea/project as you are. I had a really great group but found out late that one person in the group was just bandwagoning and the work produced by that person really showed the lack of interest. This course is what you make of it. I did a research project based around another OMS class. Based on the schedule for that class, my workload varied a fair amount week to week. There were weeks where the instructional team for the other class wanted formal writeups from me that were above and beyond what this class required. I did have a bit of a crunch at the end of the semester, as I didn't have my full data available for analysis until about a week before the final project was due, which meant that I put in a lot of hours the last week analyzing data and writing. \n\nDavid Joyner describes this class as a mini Ph. D. and I think it's a perfect description. You explore your educational interests, propose a project, have it accepted, do the project, and defend your results. Many students picked difficult projects, put in a lot of hours, and produced amazing results. Other students put less in and got less out. I have a paper that is close to being ready for publication that I do intend to submit this summer to its intended journal. Since there's currently no research track available in OMS, this class was a welcome bit of research. I'd love to see more classes like it if not a full research path available for OMS students! If you like research, this class is for you. If you'd rather read, do problem sets, and take exams, pick another course. This course is one of the best courses i've ever taken, online or offline. There are a lot of learning moments for each individual, from reading papers, to gathering peer feedback to building, designing, and scaling up or down the project based on your own abilities. I think at the end of it, not only did I learn about education technology, but I also learned about how I learned and how I analyzed and tackle projects.\n\nGreat class and honestly, the workload is what you put in it. If you want to learn more and deep dive, feel free, but if you want to do the bare minimum, that's ok too.  This class is a lot what you make out of it. You start the class with a bunch of essays slowly narrowing down you topic. Should be at least one less essay in my opinion. The instructor, Dave, is really involved and will probably write to much instead of not enough. TL;DR will happen some, you can't help it. There is no real videos as it is all about the conversations hence the didn't read above. Also, I think the Peer Reviews were mostly crap as most didn't really provide any input anyway. I always did but others just did an exercise instead of a way to help others. The project itself was incredibly open ended and the meat of the class. I thought there were alot of useless projects people took on, however, it might have just been hard to come up with ideas. Here is where you can get a lot or a little out of the class. The TAs and Dave are here to help you in this open ended way. The class is an easy A but it is what you make out of it. You can learn a lot or a little but depends on you. Interesting concept for a class (being lecture less) and has merit. Grading of a class like this does require a finesse which I am thinking is a little lacking at moment. Overall, a fantastic class by a fantastic instructor and would recommend. If nothing else to get use to how upper academia is done. My criticism is just to let people know what they are getting. Note, my project was fun to do but it was one I thought about ahead of time noted below as important. If you go into this class with a clear project in mind, you will love it. \n\nYou will be spending a lot of time writing and peer reviewing other students. The peer review process made it clear that students who didn't have a clear project definition, and students without strong project management skills, struggled with this class. \n\nOverall, this is a \"capstone\" kind of class, that is best taken once you've developed strong research and project management skills.  This class is fairly unique in that it begins with discovery and research of the domain but finishes with a 100% self-driven project, either done with a team or individually. As a professional software developer having built some POC/crude mobile apps, I used this opportunity to use a framework and toolset I have always wanted to try but never had the time or project-idea that combined led me to actually investing the time to learn and develop the application. This class gave me that flexibility with some rigor through a proposal with a timeline and ultimate deliverable with the flexibility to adjust as needed. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this class for anyone who genuinely is interested in exploring the intersections between education and technology and is interested in either developing content, doing research, or developing an application to add to the community. The flexibility to do a more research based approach versus a development approach is something that I think most people will enjoy about this class. Simply explore, learn, and contribute. \n\nAlso, the professor is very engaging and constantly is a resource to contribute and inspire conversations. Great class. You choose your project and develop it during the semester, alone or as a team. Instructors and classmates offer support and feedback. Professor Joyner is fantastic. This course should be mandatory for first semester omscs student! It is very well organized and Prof. David Joyner is such a positive influence in the course interactions and all communications throughout. Peer feedback is a great feature to learn about other projects and possibilities. Highly recommend this course. You will guaranteed to learn other fascinating things beside computer programming. This is a great course after you have some experience in OMSCS. I've seen wonderful projects ranging from instant messaging APP to second language study software. The tutor is helpful all the time and the progress is very much self-paced. You will like it a lot!\n\nI also saw in this class people recorded podcasts about wine or wrote about gender in IT. It seems to me that you can do whatever you want in the class. It sounds cliche, but this class is what you make of it. You are the primary driver of what you learn. During this course there are two tracks you can take: research or development. Both require you to conduct a mini \"literature review\" before you can begin your final project. If you choose research you will either conduct your own study or find a new way to examine existing data/studies. If you choose the development track you will create a working prototype/product. There are really no lectures outside of a few at the beginning and then any others you choose to watch while trying to land on a research topic. \n\nThere are papers you must write during the initial research phase as you narrow down your topic. During the project phase you must do weekly check ins and two milestones. The final project is a paper formatted for journal publication, the actual project (paper or prototype), and then the actual files/research you used. \n\nI personally chose to do develop an actual prototype. I was given free reign to pick the platform and the features as long as I could justify them. I really enjoyed working on the project and was able to produce something I had always dreamed of producing. \n\nThat last point is something that the instructor specifically designed the course to encourage. During course feedback on Piazza I said at times I felt like I was paying money to work on a hobby project. He responded saying that was the idea. This course will give you credit for working on a passion project. You can then use the results for other endeavors: publishing, PhD, or even a start up. You will ultimately learn only what you choose to learn. If you want an easy A you could likely get that done, but honestly it would be a waste if you don't use the opportunity to push yourself. This is a great class where you get out of it what you put in. It's quite easy to get an A by putting in minimal effort; if you at least execute on the main grading points of each assignment, you're guaranteed an A. However, the one pain point of this class is the rush to complete the final project. I would recommend getting as much done as possible well ahead of time, because you will have to submit a formatted paper, a video presentation, and your actual project. The course library is very well thought-out and organized (if incomplete at this time). The forums are active, which is typical of a Joyner course. I would definitely recommend taking this class. Dr. Joyner is amazing, as usual. My mentor is also amazing, I guess also as usual? He's got some reputation, so I heard, though this is my first time I had \"met\" him. My classmates are amazing. We have another TA who has been really friendly, helpful and also amazing. My teammates are amazing, and I think we did an amazing job. Everything is amazing, but still, if you get to decide whether to take this course on a shorter summer or on a full semester, I suggest you choose the full semester. Those extra 3 to 5 weeks would be a very big difference. Really big. \n\nBTW, there are now three available tracks: research, development, content. One of my favorite classes. It's the first course where could throw your efforts into something you find super interesting. The entire course is focused around a project you get to choose. The professor is highly engaged.", 
    "CS-6475": " This was my first class in the OMSCS program, and I would recommend it to other students as a first class. TA involvement was high throughout the class, and assignments / feedback was given quickly and with clarity. A few elements felt shaky (peer reviews) due to growing pains with switching to Canvas.\n\nThe grading scheme for most of the glass was to allow between 10-20 'easy' points, and 10-20 'hard' points per assignment. Most of the homework was subject to an Above and Beyond rule limiting the grade to a 90 without extra effort. The best approach to get full credit was to find a research paper related to the assignment and implement. The grading scheme makes a B average fairly straight forward to obtain, but requires significant extra effort throughout the semester for an A. The final exam was full of 'trick' questions and no curve, so it was important to go in with a high average if shooting for an A. Great course for taking over the summer. Videos are very interesting and informative. The assignments really do teach you things that are very interesting and keep you engaged in the course. All assignments are released at the beginning of the semester, so you can move at your own pace and do not have to wait for them to be released. \n\nThe exam is the only annoyance I had with this course. It was worded very specifically and could at times be very confusing.  This course is really interesting and open ended. Expect to put in whatever free time you have available to have fun with this course. I'm taking concurrently with CV and it helps get the most out of it This is a very interesting class. The lectures are paced well, and the assignments are designed to let you focus on the material of the week without having to worry about platform difficulties. I found the organization of the class a little frustrating in that assignments were returned late (and in one case not given to us on time), and I noticed several instances of fairly obvious errata in the lectures. That said, I really learned a lot, and the lectures were very engaging. I also loved the flexibility of the final project. If you've got ideas that you're interested in trying out, you will be rewarded here! I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone in the program. I'd suggest getting an old SLR off ebay if you don't already have a digital camera with as many manual controls as possible. You'll also want a tripod or some other method of holding your camera steady because one project in particular requires low-light photography.  This is just a placeholder given the course so far. This class is only limite by how much you put in. My decent knowledge of Python was not sufficent, as most of the assignment involve numpy arrays and indexing. You will be embarrased by how much easier the assignments are if you have an excellent grasp of slicing arrays, indexing, re-shape and other shortcuts and functions that cut out loops similar to Matlab. Going from the lectures to the papers to implemnetation would have been extremely difficult without the given templates. The outputs to each assignment are super fun, and amazing. For a short course in the summer, I would suggest heavily frontloading the first 5 assignments, to leave time for the rest.  This is the type of course that I like to call an easy B but a hard A. If you're coming in with some knowledge of Python and Linear Algebra, then I would say you can put it in 10 hours per week, get most of the knowledge out of the class, and walk away with a solid B. But if you're really going for an A, then you'll find the class taking up a lot more time. The grading structure is designed such that each homework assignment has an \"Above and Beyond\" section that counts for 10%, so to get anything higher than a 90, you'll need to develop something beyond the basic requirements of the assignment. Personally I enjoyed this a lot, but it's clear that a lot of others didn't. \n\nThis class is being redesigned over the Summer, so I don't know if any of this will hold true in the Fall though. Overall I had a great time, but for the future I hope the instructors make the writeups shorter and the coding more challenging. \n\nEdit: Also definitely do the readings! They are absolutely fascinating! But don't worry about fully understanding all of the math for each reading - you just need to get the gist of them. Probably my favorite course in the program so far. This class is project driven and due to the \"you only get 90% unless you go 'above and beyond' \" rule, some projects I undertook were fun, but total time sinks. You get much creative freedom in what you want to do in this class within the scope of the assignment (e. g. use \"Use epsilon photography\")\n\nIf you go the bare minimum route, this class has a light workload, and can be done with another class easily. I found when I had a packed life schedule, I could tie up a base project in a night or two and submit and move on. \n\nPeer reviews were scary at first, but ended up being very helpful and useful to build a class culture and learn new tricks. \n\nThe one Piazza thread per project seems miserable at first as it can't be loaded on mobile devices (especially when people are posting lots of images). However, it seemed to work significantly better than in my other classes. The professor wasn't on Piazza much, but with so much TA involvement that never was an issue. \n\nThis class covers many similar topics as Computer Vision, but takes a fun, more artistic approach.  Normally I don't take option classes too seriously, but I have to say I just loved this class. Almost every assignment was super interesting, challenging and rewarding. Arguably one of the best classes in OMSCS. I wish all the classes were this good.  I took this course during Spring 2018 and paired it with HCI.  This was my first semester in OMSCS.  Overall, the course was good.  As many mentioned, you can only make a 90% for most assignments without doing Above and Beyond work.  This work isn't impossible, but even then you most likely won't get higher than a 95.  \n\nIf you aren't an amazing programmer, I would highly suggest you start on the projects well before they are due.  Don't procrastinate.  The TA's will not help on the projects in any way.  You will run into issues.  Start early on everything.  Before the midterm project, there is only one assignment that requires any coding at all, so the difficulty jump here is terrible. You need to brush up on your python and numpy skills well before you get to this point.\n\nThe notebook quizzes are terrible.  There is no other way to describe them.  They are only worth a tiny portion of your grade, though, so not too big of a problem.  \n\nThe assignments are pretty fun, but you don't code until about 1/3 of the way in as I mentioned before.  \n\nThe final project is student choice.  I didn't find this project as hard, but I had also gotten used to Numpy by this time.\n\nThe final exam is hard, but you get two chances.  Study and you will get a good grade.\n\nThe slack channel is your friend.  Seriously.  Bookmark this channel.  It is incredibly active and is probably the easiest way to get your questions answered.  One of the TA's is involved there and he is incredibly helpful.  You can also get great ideas for Above and Beyond in this channel.\n\nOverall, I liked this course a lot. I definitely recommend it and can easily be paired with a second course if you have the time.  Just make sure to get ahead on that midterm.    A really fun course. I personally learned a lot and thought the assignments were very enjoyable. The class was also really well organized (the TAs are very responsive both to questions and to feedback, I found very few issues in the assignments, grading wasn't exceptionally fast but still a lot better than in the other class I was taking etc. ). \n\nNote that most of the assignments require taking your own pictures, which some people might find a waste of time if they're only interested in the \"computational\" aspect of CP. Personally I thought that on the contrary learning about photography is obviously an essential part of mastering Computational Photography, which is also why I enjoyed the \"Camera Obscura\" homework that some people have criticized below. \n\nThe \"mandatory\" part of the assignments is pretty easy (I recommend learning about advanced indexing in numpy, which makes most of the coding trivial), but it only counts for 90% of your grade on the assignment. The remaining 10% is \"Above & Beyond\", which I find very motivating in terms of expanding your learning, and it can be pretty hard to get a full 100% on an assignment. Because that was what I aimed for, my workload was fairly high and the course was of Medium difficulty for me instead of Easy. If you just do the bare minimum, the course might qualify as Easy, but your odds of getting an A will be much lower. \n\nI haven't taken CV but it is clear that there is some overlap, so if you've taken CV you will probably have an easier time in CP. In general, I really liked this course. The content was interesting, and the homework assignments were a lot of fun. \n\nUnfortunately, it was certainly not perfect. Each homework assignment focused on a different computation technique or aspect of photography, and the coding/interactive portions were a blast. However, along with each assignment, we had to complete a lengthy PowerPoint report. The report templates contained many relevant questions and topics to respond to, but there were also numerous \"busy-work\" questions as well, and we had to go into great detail for each question in order to get full points. \n\nOn the topic of \"full points, \" the grading policy was the worst part of the course. By completing all requirements in a single homework assignment, the max possible score was a 90/100. In order to get any portion of the last 10%, we had to go \"above and beyond. \" The requirement for this was extremely subjective, so maybe this was a decent idea in theory, but it didn't work very well in my experience with the class. In addition to this, the grading/late policy just generally had no flexibility, and it punished all students equally, regardless of whether they were truly lazy/incompetent or just busy with another work/life issue, which is likely more common with OMSCS students compared to on-campus students. Perhaps it was fair in a way - it just seemed overly harsh to me. \n\nALL that being said, the course was a ton of fun, and it was a great way to brush up on Python/numpy skills. It was somewhat more time-consuming than I anticipated due to the long reports required for each assignment, but it was generally easy overall, in my opinion. \n\nIf you're at all interested in photography or image computation/manipulation, give this course a shot. Hopefully the grading policy will get an overhaul at some point, but it's definitely manageable if you put in some extra effort. I imagine it will provide a good head start for the CV course, but I have not taken that... yet! The contents of this class are really fun and mind blowing. Assignments are organized and most recently seems to push students to write code and reports well. Be aware that this is not an easy class at all! Reviews seem to be outliers from past semesters. One thing that makes it hard is the pace the assignments are released / delivered throughout the course, every week. With the A&B concept it makes really hard to get 100%. I myself went A&B a few times only. Not easy to get an A and with a lot of work I got a B. This class vacillated quite a bit for me in terms of workload and ease. Some weeks both were very low (2-3 hours) and then the next would be significantly higher (10+). Almost every project was fun and cool, though. \n\nMy primary complaint is with the rubric for a baseline of 90 points for doing everything as requested and the remaining 10 points for going above and beyond. This is great in theory, but it's a total black box and is wholly subjective. Sometimes I got a 100 and then the next week I'd get a 93 when I put in as much work if not more and there's really no useful feedback there. \n\nBy my calculations I'm getting an A but I feel like I had to shoot in the dark a lot.  This class is interesting. You get to play with several image processing techniques to create novel images. Some of the papers discussed in the class are truly remarkable. Its a good idea to give yourself time to understand and even implement them. Assignments are graded over a 90% scale.. its not too hard to get the 90%. But if you want 100% you need to make extra efforts in creating a nice image or exploring some new technique. The Summer semester was well paced, however I did not like having to turn things in twice a week a bit hard to manage during a full working schedule and trips.  I really enjoyed this class. Helps to have an understanding of Python and Numpy before taking the class, and many of the homework assignments were pretty easy - most of them used Python. The final test was somewhat challenging (many errors in it), but we were allowed to take it twice. The final tests was based on lecture material so take good notes.  Interesting class. You will need Python and OpenCV. This is a very nice introduction class to computer vision. The lectures are producted based on a lot of real projects, which will help you have a feel about the frontier of this area and let you know the basic concepts and algorithms in Computer Vision. One thing need to be mentioned is when I took computational photography in my college two years ago, it's mainly about 3D remodel and curve fitting algorithms, but this class is more about computer vision. I enojoyed it anyway, highly recommend! Overall I enjoyed this class. There were some parts that had to much photograph and not enough programming. Some of the assignemnts are just photograph projects.  This was a fun course with a little bit different flavor than most CS courses. For the assignments there is rarely a correct answer, its more like essay questions only with visuals instead of words. The course organization and execution was excellent. The TA's were very responsive and helpful. Professor Essa's enthusiams for the subject really comes through in the lectures.  This course didn't require an immense amount of memorization or rote learning. Instead, it required a strong focus on the topics being presented and a time commitment to do the assignments. A lot of the time spent will be on assignments that go beyond just coding.  Throughout the course, the TAs and instructors tell you to 'have fun' with computational photography. I can say that some of the assignments are indeed fun. Do an internet search for 'camera obscura' to get an idea of what you might be doing. That said, there was a *lot* of work to be done in the Summer semester. Most weeks there are two (2) assignments due! Assignments usually consist of writing code and/or taking pictures and/or performing experimentation in addition to writing a report! So needless to say, you will be busy. Grading is somewhat subjective as well, since anything above 90% requires you to go 'above and beyond'. Overall, this is a good class and I do strongly recommend it. Just know what you are getting into before signing up.  Mileage could differ depends on where you're coming from, but even as a summer course (2 assignments due a week), it is manageable. The framework of the course provided much of implementation so you could complete most processing algorithms even without readings beyond lectures, but to get over 90%, more research and creativity will be needed. Having a SLR camera (or good digital camera) could make the most of the course I think.  This is a very great and interesting class. It not only dives into the aspects of computational photography but you get a brief history on photography itself. The assignments are very interesting but can sometimes be challenging if you don't have both python and mathematical backgrounds. The one downside of the course is the lack of office hours and instructor/TA availablility. Often times I would ask questions on Piazza without them even being reviewed. I struggled with the python a little bit and wish I had some direction. The course is overall really good, though.  If you ever wondered how cameras work, how panaromas are created, how to recognize objects in an image, take this course. Prof Issa passionately explains the material, and provides helpful links to papers which study the materials in more details. Both he and TA Daniel Castro are available on Piazza daily. Assignments are very well explained, and reasonably difficult. Some of them are programming assignments using OpenCV+Python, some require you to take pictures and experiment with different camera parameters, and some combine both. At least in our class, forum participation is very active, with over 500 posts, sharing not only questions about the assignments but also results of our photographic creations and links to articles about latest advancements in computer vision and photography. Overall, great experience, and one of the best courses available.  I took this course after Computer Vision. It is not as well organized as CV, and the videos are more annoying than educational, but it's a good course to take if you're interested in photography and manipulating images.\n\nThe mid-term project could potentially be very difficult if you go in without python & numpy experience. In my case, CV provided the background to make CP only medium difficulty.\n\nTips to get an A: \n1. Always try for A&B: The above and beyond grading scheme on the assignments is a strange beast. On one hand, you have absolutely no clue how to get that final 10% of your grade. On the other hand, it encourages you to just try something -  just use your wild imagination and creativity - and you are rewarded by the fair and generous grading.\n\n2. The assignments, projects and exams get progressively harder and trickier towards the end of the course, so work hard at the beginning and don't procrastinate.\n3. You're generally graded on the quality of the report and not the code, so have fun coding and all, but to get full marks, make sure you answer all the questions and follow all the guidelines in the report. In fact, if your code fails or you run out of time, you can still get a good grade by describing what you did and didn't do. Very informative and relaxed course. I personally don't like Python, but it's manageable. Love the class! My first OMS class, only 4 weeks to go. I have enjoyed it the whole way, learned a lot. Essa's lectures are good, I take notes on them as I watch. Comes in handy on the assignments so I can go right back to the exact section where he talked about something. Since they want you to use your own pics, it invests me with more interest in the assignments. I think the assignments have been very clear, and really not that hard conceptually. Paying attention to what is asked and answered on piazza helps. This is the first time I ever coded in python, that cost me hours of learning the syntax. OpenCV has reasonable documentation, but it might not all apply to your version. So fun at 2am. It's really opened my eyes to what is possible with computers. we are writing our own code, or using open source, and it has generally had impressive results. Class piazza tips and help has been invaluable, and people have seemed to hit the right balance between enough help to move on, but not give away too much. reading the suggested papers has provided the answers to how to progress more than once. This has been a great intro to the program, fun to be challenged again.  I wish this course was a little more difficult. I haven't had to watch the lectures at all the entire semester and I have a 100 in the course... AND this is the first time I've ever used Python. A little disheartened that this course isn't challenging and I am starting to realize that I probably should have taken Computer Vision instead is I wanted more difficult programming exercises. Also very slow to get grades back. It's April and we haven't gotten grades back for assignments we completed in February.  This class is not terribly hard mathematically/conceptually, but the assignments can be very time consuming and are not always well-designed. Still, I overall found the course to be well-taught and a solid introduction to computational image processing with OpenCV. This was a very interesting class with responsive and fair TAs. There was a project every week which included a Python coding portion and PowerPoint presentation that you submit as a PDF. At the end of the course was a final exam and final project which were both time consuming but rewarding. \nThe only thing I didn't like about this course was building the Camera Obscura. The quality of your results depended on how crafty you were, but it was still interesting to turn a room into a camera. \nIf you are interested in computer vision or photography and enjoy applying computation to art, I would definitely recommend this class. A lot of interesting material is presented in this class related to photography. There are 11-12 assignments which vary in difficultly, plus a take-home final, and a final free-form project. The class is python based and makes heavy use of OpenCV. I enjoyed the class.  If you have taken CV, this course is super easy. If you are an amazing photographer and are very creative, but new to programming, the course is easy. If you have not taken CV, fiddling with a DSLR for the first time and want to get an A [in other words, if you are like me], this course is moderately tough. All assignments except panorama and HDR require very simple python programming. If you are new to numpy, just brush up on some basic numpy tutorials. There are 11 assignments, 1 final project and 1 final exam. 9/11 assignments and the final project have 10 points for above and beyond and the course has absolute grading [no curves]. So, if you want an A then you should have 90+ in all assignments, final project and the exam. Modules 6, 7 and additional reading in module 8 cover very cool, useful and advanced topics and watching/reading them early will give good ideas for the final project. Also, please take notes while watching the lectures because without the notes, it is very difficult to get high marks in the final exam.  Professor and TAs are fairly active on the forums. The lectures are very interesting but some of the projects felt only partially fleshed out. I did enjoy it as a photography enthusiast but some of it felt trivial.  This is my first course, and i loved it. the lectures were very clear and precise and give you the understanding of material easily. the assignments were not that tough as the initial template code gives you lot of hints to complete the assignment(which i think should not be the case, as it takes away lot of learning). there is amble of time to complete the assignments and for most we had two weeks to complete, we had totally 6 assignments this semester, be warned that, only 40 - 50% mark for coding and the other 40 - 50% is for report in which you have to answer lot of questions and contemplate on your understanding and your work on that assignment. Assignments also had a concept called Above & Beyond, i never tried A&B, you have to do something extract other than required on that assignment topic to receive A&B which counts for 10 mark. we also had a mid term project which is the replication of an published paper, this was the most difficult assignment of all to me, but if you spend enough time it will be an easy A. we had two attempts at the exam, and exam is easy one but really tricky one, as there are multiple choice questions, if wrong answer selected negative marking is given. choose your final project when you reach mid term itself and start working on it, as much as possible choose an easy topic as you have the liberty to choose the topic.\n\nOver All this class is very good class. I enjoyed this class, but it was an interesting experience. Firstly while I ranked the class Easy because it is pretty easy to do the base requirements of the class, I actually spent the same number of hours per week on this course in the summer terms as I have spent per week on ML and CCA during the full terms. This is partly a factor of the reduced term period, but also because I also spent a lot of extra hours on Above & Beyond work for the homeworks just because I got obsessed and was having fun. If you restrain your enthusiasm then you will reduce your workload by a large amount. On the other hand I think putting in the extra time will help you get more out of it because the base parts of all the homework assignments are pretty easy and simple. \n\nWhile the material and base assignments were pretty simple, this summer the assignments were being reworked for autograding which meant they were not released in advance, so it made dealing with summer travel more difficult as we had about 2 assignments due each week for the first two months of the course. The pace was sustainable but a little tiring due to my travel plans and not being able to work ahead. Be aware of that even though the course is ranked easy (in future semester perhaps this won't be a problem). \n\nI had taken CV prior to this course, so in several areas the CP material was simpler and a less in-depth treatment of the material. However in the 6th and 7th lecture modules of the course they cover more specialized topics that were interesting and for the \"8th\" module we were given a collection of 6 academic papers to read. Reading those were my favorite section of the course and I highly recommend reading them early as they give some good ideas for final projects. Like the above & beyond work, you will get more from the class if you challenge yourself on the final project - that gives you a chance to go deep into an interesting area of your choice. Be creative.  Really fun course. It's a good survey of computational photography techniques, with a fair amount of information about the basics of photography. Not a lot of detail or rigor in describing and analyzing the algorithms; if you want that, CS 4495 (Computer Vision) is a better choice; from what I hear, it's quite complementary to this course. The programming assignments are pretty easy if you're comfortable with python and working with images. This class reminds me of 8803 (AI for Robotics): knowledgable, enthusiastic professor; very interesting topics; more about breadth than depth.  This is a very time consuming course contrary to what previous semester reviews say. Course material is taught clearly by the professors so understanding the material is not a challenge. You will want to review the material thoroughly as the final really gets into the details from lecture. There are a tremendous amount of interesting topics to learn even if you don't take photographs often. \n\nYou should expect to spend significant hours on the class if you want to master the assignments. I was not able to do all of the readings even spending 30 hours. If you only want to pass the class with a C or B then the 10 hour estimates are correct. First two weeks of class is only about 5 hours but it ramps up quickly. \n\nIf you are aiming for an A the majority of your time will be spent on above and beyond (independent research) and writeups. Expect about 2-3 hours a week on lecture (take notes while watching!), 5 hours on coding for complex base parts of assignments, 3-5 hours on writeup for base assignment, and the remaining time on independent research (both coding and writeups). Also a variable amount of time on taking your own photographs depending on the project. \n\nThe course will be undergoing a revision this fall so hopefully the workload comes down. Also a more flexible grading rubric (or more points allotted to overall quality of explanations) could further differentiate students who put effort into the assignments vs those who did not. I really enjoyed the class and highly recommend it. This was my first class in OMSCS and overall I enjoyed it! I am a hobby photographer myself so it was really cool being able to see how photography techniques were implemented on the backend, like panoramas and HDR.\n\nTechnically, the class was medium difficulty. There were assignments every few weeks, along with a midterm project and final project. There were also a few quizzes and a final test. You'll notice in a lot of the other reviews they mention the \"above and beyond\" aspect of a lot of assignments. The vast majority of assignments were \"above and beyond\", meaning that if you fulfilled all the requirements, the highest grade you could get was a 90%, and the rest of the 10% comes from going above and beyond the original requirements. Getting all of this 10% was pretty tricky. Some assignments, like the midterm and final projects, were not subject to this rule.\n\nBecause of the A&B rule, it was relatively straight forward to get a B in the class, but difficult to get an A.\n\nThe class is done mainly using Python and Numpy - would recommend getting familiar with those tools to have an easier time in the class This is nice course but the pacing is very high during summer with 2 assignments per week. There is a lot of things to learn and the subject matter and techniques that you learn are fascinating. However, during summer 2016, the professor did not participate in the class discussions and it felt sometimes like we were on our own.  This was my 6th class. I was somewhat prepared to take this class. I took this class purely out of my interest and for fun. Experience in KBAI from last summer helped me wee little. Looking back, I should have taken CP class before KBAI. exam. My only criticism, is this class seems to bite more than we can chew at times, lectures are over-packed and at times. Video lectures sometimes become too much \"illustrative\", and some of the useful details seem to get left out, when the lectures say this is just for the illustrative purposes. And because of this, you might understand how something works, but might not always understand why something works. I loved the idea of Above and Beyond (A&B) in the assignment, it did seem to align well with the spirits of the masters' degree. If you are planning to go with CP&R specialization, definitely take CP before CV. I am coming from 6+ yrs of professional C# and .NET experience, but regardless, I definitely would recommend some good practice with Python, NumPy and OpenCV, bring down your workload. The assignments are not that hard, but they might seem challenging at times. I found the midterm project (Seam Carving) challenging. The class let's you pick your own final project, so you can truly make the most out of this class. Final exam was neither too hard nor too easy. Do read the question twice, in the final test. I expect them to lower the velocity. I did not always appreciate when the videos ignore some of the necessary details. Overall, stay consistent, do the the exercises, spend time reading the white papers. Take the time to read the white papers. there are a TON OF WHITE PAPERS TO READ, which might seem overwhelming, but do not forget you are a graduate student, at Georgia Tech. Fun fact: in the Udacity video lectures, the processor utters the word \"of course\" 1395 times. A just about perfect course -- interesting lectures, interesting projects, and clear expectations. It actually works better online than it would in a classroom. And what a fun topic -- it is so refreshing to do computing math and actually see a result that looks like something! I strongly recommend this course. \nIt's an excellent summer option, but with the compressed schedule on many weeks there are two assignments due, making it more challenging to keep up. \nAssignments are Python (Numpy, Scipy, and CV2). If you aren't a solid Python programmer, this course will help you as you look at your classmate's examples (slicing arrays, set operations with np). And if you are a bad photographer, you will at least learn how to be bad in novel ways.  I found this course to be more of an application of the concepts you learn in CS6476 (CV). Although, it's less intense & not as stressful(except for those odd days). Should be much easier if one has completed CV. The course load is very well distributed. It had 7 assignments, 2 project work (mid-term research work replication & final project) & one final examination (with upto 2 attempts - max considered :))\nThe TAs are vell organized, very passionate & very helpful too. Despite their own course loads, they were present on piazza (&slack) answering questions; both technical & logistical...\nThe only not-so-positive aspect for me personally was that a significant portion of assignment grades were deteremined by quality of report. This sometimes makes you feel that some technical challenges resolved/attempted were getting overlooked especially if you are not one of those who are good at reporting :).\nHaving completed more rigourous courses like CSE 6220(IPC), CS6601(AI) & CS6476(CV) where the reporting was not a big factor in determing the grades found this a little discouraging. But on the brighter side, it's gave an opportunity for me to improve on these aspects (which is definitely important in professional life).\nOver & above the computation part, the fun aspect was experimenting with photography... I used the opportunity to get myself a nice SLR (not mandatory for the course) & learnt quite a bit of photography during the last 4 months.\nIf you need a term break from the heavy load ones & want to have some fun along with learning, will recommend this course.  This is not an easy A class anymore, I narrowly got an A. To prove my point, see grade distribution for pass semesters: https://omscentral. com/grades/6475, As are trending down. If you do the minimal in \"guided\" projects, and get everything right, you'll get 90 on each project, you must do extra and produce good report to get > 90. 1 or 2 project require special camera/environment setup, if you are traveling/on the road, you might have a hard time with those. The final project is \"unguided\" and from the 3 peer reviews I did, they bite off more than they can chew and ended with no/poor result. Keep good notes on Udacity lectures, you'll need them for the final exams. Overall, very good class, I fully enjoyed it. As an amateur photographer, this was a cool class to take to get a better understanding of what computational photography is and its wide breadth of applications. The homeworks were in Python and were typically straightforward and easy to complete. The final project was a little more work, and I wish that there was more guidance from the TAs on expectations or sample final projects before turning the students loose. The open-book final exam was pretty easy as long as you took notes on the lectures throughout the class and could search them for the answers. Beware of earlier reviews from previous semesters that suggest this course is easy. The assignments have been retooled somewhat to include more complexity, providing more of a challenge. In addition, at least for this summer term, we were presented with the full workload from an academic term in the compressed summer timeframe, meaning most of the 11 assignments were given two at a time (and not in advance. ) In some cases, changes were still being made to assignments days before they were due. \n\nThe course material itself is fascinating; I really enjoyed everything we learned about, and in retrospect would have preferred taking this course in a full term to really be able to dig into the material, instead of just finishing up assignment after assignment. The final project was especially rewarding. The exam was \"check all that apply\" multiple choice, appeared deliberately vague and misleading in places, and was a mess in my opinion. \n\nAdministration of the class this summer was also troubling. The professor was entirely absent - he weighed in twice in Piazza and was otherwise absent, and his TAs appeared to have trouble getting guidance on simple questions that needed to be answered for assignments that had been changed (e. g. \"Can we use X function, or is it in the group that is not allowed?\"), leading to confusion and frustration on the part of students. The confusion, stupid fast workload and angst all made what should have been an enjoyable survey course one of my least favorite in the program as far as organizational issues went. That said, I greatly value everything I learned in that class, and will take a risk on taking CV with the same instructor -- during a regular term! -- solely because of what I learned there. This is a very fun course that is heavily project-based, and most of the projects are at least partially open-ended. The assignments are a mix between structured programming assignments that implement specific algorithms covered in the lectures and non-programming assignments that involve more of a focus on photography and using software to manipulate your photos. For most of the assignments completing the assignment as specified correctly only earns a 90% score (which is the cutoff for an A grade in this course) and you are on your own to figure out some way to go \"above and beyond\" to earn the last 10%. I really liked this aspect of the course because it let me pursue my own ideas and experiment with the material from the course on my own. There is also an open-ended final project that can be done individually or as a group, and a final exam. The final exam does a good job covering all of the material from the course and is open-notes, so if you understand the material in the course you should be able to get a good score on it. The overall workload of the course is flexible, especially if you try to go above and beyond for every assignment, and in general you will be rewarded for putting a lot of effort into the course even if your end results are not amazing. \n\nIn terms of what you should know going into the course, general Python and numpy experience will be helpful since there is a fairly large amount of programming in the course, although for the most part the assignments mainly involve understanding how to apply the algorithms from the course rather than involving much complex code. Being familiar with the math used in the course is also very helpful (especially matrix operations which are heavily used) although the lectures do an excellent job of explaining things. Also having a high quality camera is not required, but having a camera that has manual settings for things like exposure time makes many of the photography-based significantly assignments easier (as does having a tripod for your camera). The lectures do not assume any previous knowledge about photography, digital images, or the algorithms used in the course, but those topics are covered in a lot of detail so there is a lot to learn from this course. \n\nOverall I would say if you are interested in photography and image manipulation and want to get some practical experience with both this is a great course.  Assignments were interesting and final project allowed for bringing together what you learn. Enjoyed the projects. Final Exam is a huge pain of nit-picking multiple guess. That was the only frustration.  Subject is interesting with lots of real world usages but teaching methods were the main reason for disliking it. Course videos are pretty average. Assignments ask for too much write up in detail, this led me to lose the interest. There is \"Above and Beyond\" rule for all the assignments and its an irritating one. (If you are an TA reading this, please use challenge question method used in CV and remove this A&B). Mid term project and final project are interesting. Exams are too tricky with words not with knowledge or logic. This class starts slow at first not quite feeling like a CS class, but by the end you're replicating research from the mid 2000's. The final project was choose your own adventure... This class was a lot of fun and very interesting to me. I loved everything about it except the assignment to build a pinhole camera (I hated that assignment but others loved it, go figure). The workload is fairly light and easy despite getting to learn a lot of fascinating and useful photography and computer vision algorithms and implementing some yourself. You get to pick what you do for the final project which is really cool (just remember to scope it down so you have time to finish). The exam was open book. I loved that we got to review each others work and share our outputs on Piazza, very creative and fun way to learn more. The support on Piazza was fabulous and the coding assignments even came with unit tests! It's been two years since I took this class and I still remember it very fondly and wish I could take more classes like it (I wish there were more classes like it)! (Updated review after the end of the first semester). This is a great course. Professor Essa is enthusiastic about the material and thorough in explaining it. The Piazza engagement from all instructors and the studnets has been very positive and helpful. The material is not tremendously challenging, and that comes from someone who struggles at times with linear algebra - this course focuses more on application of concepts rather than the mechanics behind the concepts themselves. The course started with an example that bordered on a magic trick, which definitely set the stage for it to be an engaging semester. The workload is moderate and consistent. There is ample room to go above and beyond on the projects if you have extra time, but you can usually squeak by on them without losing too much sleep. As this was the first semester, there were a few (expected) hiccups, but they were for the most part minor. I definitely recommend that you engage with the extra material presented on Piazza and elsewhere, as there is some truly fascinating stuff in there.  The course is full of fun. Learned a lot about photography and how photo editing software works. The assignments are not very difficult but encourage the creativity for more points. It is really a pleasure to do peer review and honestly I was amazed by many of my classmates' work. TA and the professor were very active on Piazza, as well as lots of discussion and showcase of assignments and projects. I was pretty proud of myself when I was making my portfolio listing all the assignments and project done during the semester.  The course begins deceptively slowly, then accelerates without remorse.  Definitely start (and finish) all assignments as early as possible.  In comparison to other courses, the lectures are of marginal learning value, so count on having to complete the readings and probably do some extra learning on your own.  Prof Issa had only one office hour session, to my knowledge, but the TAs and Slack channel were reasonably helpful.  In general, this course was easier than ML, RL, and CV, about on par with AI, AI4R, and Data Viz, and more difficult than KBAI. An easy course with simple assignments. Ideal to be paired with another class.  Not a difficult course, though the final exam was brutal.  Because I took this in the summer, the workload was much higher than you will see in other reviews. If you are not taking it in the summer, then ignore the amount of time I put into this class. \n\nOverall, I really liked this class. It allowed me to learn Python, and do some really cool stuff with photos and videos. The final exam is a little lame, but overall the assignments were really interesting, and the ability to choose your final project is also a great idea. Class is all about TAs, no professor interaction. Not an issue, but set expectations accordingly.  \n\nGood to have some idea of linear algebra and calculus. Not a must, but helpful. Also, Python programming experience, particularly with numpy, will give you big head start. If you are not comfortable with those the optional programming work leading up to your first quiz is a good way to ramp on the Python & numpy piece. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, my understanding is this class became more difficult starting Fall 2017. As a consequence, instead of being a likely A with relatively low effort it's a likely B. I expect an A, but have done a lot of work to secure as explained next. \n\nOf the course's 7 assignments, 6 are setup that you can reach a maximum of 90% following directions. The remaining 10% - referred to as Above & Beyond (A&B) - requires that you do something else of your own invention related to the assignment. TAs will give suggestions or hints, but this is where you can easily spend 90% of your time and learn the most. Meanwhile keep in mind it's only worth 10% of the assignment grade. \n\nMidterm was difficult and saw 10-15% of the class drop. Implement a selected research paper. Took me more than ~ 60/hrs to do it. Very interesting work however, the sort of thing you'll probably want to share with prospective employers for instance. Mean average was a high C and counts for 12% of your overall grade. Final Project is expected to be of a similar level of difficultly - excepting you choose your research paper to implement for better or worse. \n\nFinal exam is a pain. You get two attempts, 2.5 hours per, and will need all of it. And Notebook quizzes are hard. I expect the Notebook quizzes to improve next semester. The Final Exam however is something that's been used for several semesters running so prepare for aggravation there. \n\nThe Slack channel for the class is very active and was by far the best part of the class. Piazza meanwhile got very noisy with repeat questions. \n\nFinally, get a tripod for your phone or camera if you don't have one. You can get a cheap one for ~ $20. Makes a big difference on several of the assignments.  This course, alongside KBAI, is a model course for pacing, TA involvement, assignment design and flexibility. It is paced appropriately, with small, meaningful assignments each week that correlate directly to the lessons and can be accomplished during the week over over a weekend. Very -- very -- detailed explanations of assignment rubric, comments and the autograder, and judicious flexibility when there is an error in the assignment writeup, opting in favor of the students. Unlike other courses, I was not left in doubt about what was expected for each assignment. Essa and the current TA (Daniel Castro) are both obviously interested in the material and encourage active Piazza discussion. The assignments test core material, but allow significant flexibility in the kinds of images chosen and always offer a section for explaining (inevitable) failures. Nothing but positive things to say about this course. PeerFeedback (. gatech. edu) is used well. I am both learning a lot and enjoying the class, which is about as good as you can get.  This course is a model along with 8803 Robotics on how you can do a concept application based course. Professor Essa and the assignments do a great job teaching you how to apply the concepts of computational photography. The Ta's have spent a good amount of time creating unit testing for the assignments that help provide quick feed back of your work. If you want the application side take this course, if you want the Math background take Computer Vision. Better yet take both.  Great course, with hands on projects and great programming support. No second guessing black box autograders on Udacity - TAs have done a great job with providing test harnesses on some of the assignment which guide you through implementation. Recommended Good course. Interesting topic. Cover a lot of material. Assignments ramp up pretty quick, but lots of online resources to help get through them. Midterm project was replicating a research paper and took considerable amount of time. Final project is open-ended and up to the student, which was cool. The final exam wasn't necessarily hard (open note and can take two times) but some of the questions are tricky and poorly worded. Overall I would recommend the course (especially if you are interested in photography/computer vision), but encourage students to not let themselves fall behind.  This was my first class in the program and a great introduction.  The material wasn't particularly difficult, but there is room to go as deep as you like with the above and beyond portion of the assignments.  I would recommend getting practice with Numpy if you are not familiar with it.  A cheap tripod was very useful for some of the assignments and I borrowed a DSLR for the camera obscura, which would have been much more difficult with a smartphone camera.  It was well organized and the assignments were fun.  I would recommend taking this course if you have any interest in photography or working with images. Course is easy and fun. \n\nI took CV before so it may be slightly biased from me to think the course was fairly easy. Really, only the HDR assignment proved to be any challenge. Some of the assignments I did learn a bit from, including the previous mentioned HDR assignment, panoramas, and implementing my own Canny Edge detector. \n\nBuyer beware though, many of the assignments during the course I felt were useless and a waste of time (1 / 5 / 10). These assignments were almost like high school science experiments (set up a dark room in your house and take a picture! comment on a picture you took! run a piece of software which does everything for you to make a point cloud!). I'm glad they are taking the summer off to redo the course content. It has a lot of potential as long as it gets rid of the wasteful assignments. \n\nAlso, pacing in the course is way too fast. Most assignments are a week only where two weeks is more of the OMSCS norm. This class is easy but the lectures and assignments still take good chunk of time to complete, if you want to do good work. \n\nBy far the most fun / creative OMSCS course. Highly recommended. \n\nI won't repeat what's covered but here's a break down of all the assignments if you want to gauge how much time they'll take. Front load as much as possible if you pair this course with another. \n\nGrade breakdown:\nForum Participation: 5%\nPeer review: 5%\nFinal Project: 10%\nFinal Portfolio: 2. 5%\nFina Exam : 15% (open notes unproctored, 26 MC/2. 5 hr, medium difficulty, you have 2 tries, only count highest score out of the two)\nAssignments: 62. 5%\n\nps1 A Photograph is a Photography (warm up)\n\nps2 Image I/O & Python Setup (get at least opencv 2. 4. 9+, instead of 2. 4. 8 because you might want to use SIFT in ps7).

This semester saw a reworking of the course projects, with a reduction in the amount from something like 11 down to 7, with an added new midterm project. The first run of this midterm project I feel did not provide sufficient time or feedback, which will hopefully be improved on in the future. Make sure you get started on it as soon as it is released.  There is an 'artsy' component to this class, where you have to deal with taking good pictures and then talking about how you took them well in the reports. Personally, I didn't like the subjectivity of it. \nThe most disheartening aspect of this course is that you must make up something to get more than 90% on any given assignment. What must you make up, you ask? That's a good question, as I am done with the course and still haven't figured it out. \nThe final exam was open book with two attempts, however it doesn't test that you actually know something. It's more of a needle in haystack search where you have to 'select all correct choices'. \nTAs were quite helpful throughout. Video lectures were pretty high level and didn't get into the meat of the algorithms, which made them relatively poor in my opinion. \nIf you are doing the Computational Perception specialization, you have no choice but to take this. If you have decided on any other specialization, just take Computer Vision and you would have covered a large majority of this course, with a much greater depth of understanding of the math and algorithms as well. You will learn more in depth, you won't have to make up things to get a solid A on any given assignment, and you can avoid the subjective artsy experience if that's not your thing.  The class is what you make of it - if you do the bare minimum on each assignment you can get out without too much difficulty, but there is a lot of opportunity to dive deeper into the topics and engage with your classmates and instructors. I liked it a lot. It is a super fun class especially if you have never played with images. I loved the different projects that we had to do during the course. You get to choose what you want to do in the final project. Finals were a little stressful because I had not read all the papers but in the end it is a manageable class with not a lot of workload.  This is an interesting elective course that uses primarily Python and OpenCV. There are relevant and cool topics you learn about in the lectures related to how computations/programming have enhanced the photography process. It isn't too math heavy or difficult programming. A good well balance course. Just wish the instructor was more active in Piazza.  First off I will note that the hours per week will likely be much less during a fall or spring semester. The summer semester I took had an accelerated first half of the course so we could have approximately the same amount of time to work on the final project as the fall/spring students. This means you don't loose anything doing the summer semester, which is nice. \nI had not taken CV prior to this class, but apparently they compliment each other quite well. \nMajor grade parts: 11 assignments (mini-projects), 1 final exam (which you can take twice), one final project. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the class, you cover a lot of material at a high level and then for the final project you can choose what you want to investigate more deeply. You will learn a lot of cool things you can do with photographs.  This is my first course in the program. I have some programming experience and I love photography. \n\nThe course was hard for me. I had to try hard to wrap my head around before producing a code in assignments. I also had to invest a lot of time into it. Nevertheless I loved the experience. It makes you head smoke, but you get a lot of satisfaction when you finally submit at least partially completed assignment. \nI almost never had time to complete Above and Beyond, hence not hoping for a high grade. I am actually not sure if I even get B in the end. \n\nThe midterm was brutal. I hardly got 57. Make sure you set aside a lots of time for that. I expect final and exams to be even harder. \n\nI liked the fact that we were given two weeks for assignments. It gave at least some breathing room. \n\nThe course was very well organized. TAs were very helpful and responsive. \nI love that the course makes me think and create, overcome challenges and grow. A really interesting course that does a great job of helping you understand the coding behind an awful lot of what Photoshop does. I enjoyed the lectures and the projects quite a bit. This was my first course in OMSCS, so please take this review with a grain of salt. I had no Python experience, but lot of programming time (10+ years) in C and Java. I am also an amateur photographer and very comfortable with a DSLR camera. This course comes with a weekly assignment which is to be turned in every Monday leaving very little breathing space. As this was my first course, i had signed up for only one course and was able to spend atleast a day or two for the A&B (Above and Beyond) section. For many assignments (7-8 of them), lot of time is spent on research and report writing. The TAs shared some of the exemplary reports for each assignment and it was ridiculously amazing at the amount of work being put into them :)\n\nThe first 2-3 assignments are pretty simple and straight forward, though few of them requires setting up equipment (Camera Obscura), taking loads of pictures (Photos of space, feature matching) and few assignments have specific coding requirements (HDR). We get two weeks for the final project and the final exam is an open book multi choice test. \n\nOne of the best parts of this course is the auto grader for the coding parts of the assignment with Instant feedback and unlimited submissions. \n\nFrom discussions over slack, few had paired this course with another course based on the earlier reviews and faced difficulties due to the assignment schedule. \n\nCheck the Course Google group for insight into what kind of assignments were worked upon. Good luck! This is my 3rd course in the program and by far the most organized. We didn't hear much at all from the Professor in Piazza or other forums but the TA's had everything under control. I was very impressed by the level of organization. The auto-grader (affectionately known as \"Bonnie\") helped to provide some feedback that was useful with the coding assignment. I think this course was considered one of the easier or less-difficult courses in the past but they adapted the course this Fall term. I'm not sure how difficult it was earlier but I personally feel this course is no joke. Some of the assignments in the middle of the semester caught me off guard and I found myself pulling all-nighters in some cases to get the project done. For me the Blending assignment, while very interesting, was the most difficult. The first two assignments were really good at getting the introductions to the material but about the 3rd project it got real, really fast. If you have some Python experience, an interest in photography, some level of Linear Algebra I would highly recommend this course. As a prerequisite recommendation, I would suggest getting accustomed to Numpy, you'll be using this in nearly every coding project. Also check out some OpenCV tutorials. Otherwise, enjoy computing with pictures. I rated the workload as 20 hours per week largely because of the Above and Beyond portions of the projects. This is a really good approach for a graduate level course, it allows you to dive as deep as you want on the material and there are so many cool things to explore here. I also appreciated how we had 2 weeks per project to enable getting into the material more (than having a single week for a project). Honestly some might be able to get by with 10 or 15 hours per week but if you want to learn this stuff, be prepared to set aside the time. Overall, I did not have a good experience with this course.  While I found the lecture material interesting, I think there is far too much focus on the photography aspect of the course.  While the camera obscurra is a neat project, I don't think it has any place here.\n\nProfessor:  While very clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the material, it seems that his involvement ends with the lectures.\nTAs:  Overall seemed dismissive with questions, especially with the midterm research project.  They're given the task of teaching the course\nGrading:  The 90% Above and Beyond is the stupidest grading rubric I've ever come across.\nProjects:  While interesting, I don't believe they'll ever benefit me.\nTest:  The test is open book and there are two attempts; this sounds great...but like another reviewer put it, \"turns into a digital scavenger hunt.\"  I also found it to be marred by difficult/tricky wording (most likely by someone whose first language is not english) with a majority of the questions being of the delightful format, \"Select all that apply/are correct\".  I did not feel that the final exam tested my knowledge of anything that you might take away from the course.  Also covers quite a few papers that aren't really discussed during lectures.\nTime commitment: If I'm combining the time spent working on assignments with the time to watch lectures, then it's about 20 hours, if not counting the lectures it's a bit less than that.\n\nOverall:  I was thinking about the perception specialization, but this course turned me off to that completely.  If this were the first course I've taken in the program, I'd likely question why I was bothering at all.  I regret taking this course, and in the future I hope to avoid all those involved in its creation. This class covers a ton of material. The pace is such that an assignment was due every week, which was grueling at times. For me, this also meant that I was unable to fully absorb lots of the concepts. The lectures are just \"ok\" in my opinion. In many sections the math is glossed over, which was a bit disappointing. \n\nThe \"Above and Beyond\" portion of the grading seemed rather arbitrary and subjective to me. For one assignment, I didn't even attempt the extra 10% and inexplicably got a 94 on the assignment. On the other hand, there were other assignments that I put 8-10 extra hours in and only received 1 or 2 points. Overall the process was extremely variable. Lots of it seemed like it depended on the TA you got and what mood he or she was in that day. \n\nMy biggest beef with this class was the final exam. This was unproctored and open-everything. This sounds great, but in practice it meant a bunch of questions with tricky wording. Even that wouldn't have been bad, but tricky questions were combined with poorly worded questions, making it hard to determine a question's intent. The final basically devolved into a digital scavenger hunt. I don't think it measured my knowledge of the material at all-- just how well I could use Ctrl+F. \n\nOverall this was a decent course. The homework is interesting and can be time consuming, so possibly try to take it on it's own. Interesting material but it's full on, you can't catch a break\n Very good course. Nice insights into photography and computation with photographs... \n\nIts not easy in Summer. The assignments are too much too handle. But having said that, they are very rewarding. Concept of \"Above and Beyond\" is awesome - make u push urself harder... The exam, however, is a bummer.. I got through in the second attempt - but they can replace exam with a live assignment that needs to be done in two hours.... \n\nDon't miss it if you enjoy photography.. Its simply awesome.. Interesting course but hard to absorb all the material in a meaningful way given the pace. There is an assignment due almost every week and the lectures take a long time to watch and understand. Very good notes on the lectures are needed to do well on the final which had a lot of ambiguity and almost trick questions. Great lectures, both informative and entertaining. Active and helpful piazza participation by the TA team. \n\nAssignments and the final project are difficult because completing the requirements rewards a 90%. The last 10% must come from going \"above and beyond\", which is entirely subjective and anywhere from easy to impossible depending on the grader. \n\nThe final exam was brutal. On the positive side, two T-Square timed attempts with random (at least partially different) problem sets, only the highest grade counts. Unfortunately the multiple choice questions are very nit picking and almost all are a variation of \"choose all correct answers\" with a few ambiguous options that could be interpreted either way. \n\nTime is heavily weighted toward the final project and exam at the end of the semester (20+ hours per week). The lectures and assignments earlier in the term are closer to 5-10 hours per week. This is an exemplary model for producing a very easy class. Where a bad easy class, like CS6250, has trivial assignments and artificial difficulty in the seemingly intentionally obfuscated quizzes, this class doesn't try to make things more difficult than they need to be. The assignments are released in bulk early in the semester, so it is possible to work ahead; the content is accessible, and meeting the minimum requirements of the assignments is generally very straightforward (if you know Python and Numpy); the lectures are good - although there is a great deal of overlap with CS6476 (not exactly a bad thing). The nice part about this class is that while the assignments are very easy, that has given me a lot of time to spend with the assigned reading materials (compared to, say KBAI where I completely ignored the reading material in order to tackle all the graded exercises). Overall, this is an excellent class for a light summer term, or to pair with a more difficult class like ML or CCA. A few disclaimers: first, I took this class concurrently with KBAI, and this was my first semester in the OMSCS program so my view on the class has very little reference to other classes in the program; second, I did receive an 'A' in the course, so I'll try to not let that color my opinion of it; finally, reading past reviews indicates to me that this class has undergone a fairly large transformation in the past two semesters, be careful making expectations about the course from older reviews.\n\nNow for the review: \nOverall, the course was interesting and fun, and I feel I learned quite a bit. However, there were a few things that bothered me while I was taking the course, and I wanted to wait until it was 100% over to write them up to give others a fair warning about these aspects of the course:\n\nFirst, the open-note final exam did not feel like a good test of the things I had learned watching the lectures and doing the assignments throughout the semester. Another reviewer mentioned it felt like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", but I wanted to expand on this further. Some of the material on the exam did not come from any of the class material.   Most of the exam required finding keywords in PDFs, or a specific sentence mentioned in a lecture. Many of the questions relied on wordplay to attempt to fool the test taker (similar to the lab notebooks).\n\nSecond, the midterm, which I believe was indeed a fair assessment, should have included the grading rubric when it was released. A number of students wasted a lot of time on a portion of it that ultimately was worth much less than the other portions of the exam. Ultimately I believe this contributed to that assessment being the lowest grade overall for the class project-wise. \n\nThird, it appears reviews of the Above and Beyond portion of the assignments were mixed. You really need to attempt to do all of these if you want an 'A' in the course. Personally, I was not really a fan. I thought that while the Above and Beyond sections could produce very excellent work, grading of the sections was too subjective. These Above and Beyond sections count for about 4% of your overall grade, and getting more than half of these points seemed almost unfeasible sometimes. I understand the intention to make the course more fun and produce original pieces of work, but I think more guidelines need to be set for both the students and the graders about what qualifies as an appropriate Above and Beyond. \n\nI do not mean to dissuade others from taking this class. I really did enjoy it (doing the final project and seeing others' results was AMAZING, and all of the assignments were very well-made and fun to do). The TA's were extremely knowledgeable, active and helpful. And I've never felt so much pride in the work I've done for a class. Mostly, I just wanted to make the above writeup as a refresher to the reviews from previous semesters.\n\nP.S. Buy a tripod for your phone, and start the midterm early. Projects take a significant amount of time in comparison to homeworks. Homeworks are \"fine\" and generally don't take too long. Final exam was a bit hard in my opinion, but wasn't weighted heavily enough to matter too much. Everybody else had described the class pretty well. So maybe, to add new info... \n\nIf you intend to eventually take CP, but for now are choosing only one between CP and \n- CV: \n * Choose CV if you are already OK with Python (Numpy, OpenCV). That way, you could have more ideas for A&B and project components for CP\n * Choose CV first if you intend to pair CP with a heavier course, it might make understanding CP faster thus you can give more time on your other course. \n * Choose CP if you are not confident that you can make your Python (Numpy, OpenCV) and linear algebra skills at par for CV. \n- AI4R:\n * Choose CP if the reason why you are choosing between AI4R and CP is that you want some good introduction to OMSCS. AI4R could benefit from learnings in other courses. \n * Otherwise, just choose which interests you more at this moment. \n- ML4T:\n * Choose ML4T if you are not confident with your Python (Numpy) skills. It seems learning Numpy is part of ML4T's syllabus. \n * Choose ML4T if you think you do not have much ideas to work with CP's A&B activities. \n * Otherwise, just choose which interests you more at this moment. \n- DVA:\n * Heh... I don't see an intersect... \n * Maybe choose depending on what classes you intend to take next? \n * Or as always, just choose which interests you more at this moment. \n \nObviously these are just my views, your strategy may vary. Great course. Quite easy if you know Python and numpy. With that said, you learn some cool things and some practical skills. Take it with a hard class Overall, I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in computer vision. Fun and rewarding. Workload is just average, lectures are simple and concise, something missing some details needed for the assignments. Highly recommend to take this and Computer Vision after.  Some cool assignments, some really light ones. Most take a good amount of time for the work, probably 5 - 10 hours plus a bit for write-ups. \n\nVery active Piazza. ", 
    "CS-6476": " As stated by others, this class is very hard but well worth the effort. This is probably one of the best classes in the program. In my opinion, The videos are definitely the best in the OMSCS. The material is dense but Dr Bobick cuts through the math and makes it digestible. He has a great sense of humor, and even his interaction with Megan (the videographer) cracked me up several times. Even the seemingly small detail of having a black background was well thought out, and make the videos not too straining to the eye. The problem sets are hard and you need to get on them as soon as possible. Beware of the first major assignment (Road sign detection) because it is deceivingly difficult, and the video tracking assignment which was super difficult as well. The final project will easily take up the time of 3 assignments put together. Matthew Houston definitely deserves high praise for his high-quality recorded office hours. To conclude, It's a lot of work, but you'll be glad you did it.\n\nAs an aside, I was looking at the table of contents of the CV books on Amazon, and was amazed that the class covered MORE THAN ENTIRE BOOKS on the subject! This is an awesome course and I highly recommend it. But, it's tough, and as of now (mid-semester Spring 2015) there are still some kinks being worked out. Homework deadlines have been very much in flux, we weren't told until mid-March whether there would be a final or not, and getting graded homeworks back is pretty slow. I suspect that things will run more smoothly when it's not the first semester of the class, though. Assignments can be done in Matlab or Python. We get Matlab for free. Lots of linear algebra. Personally I find the homework very difficult and time-consuming but really, really interesting.  This course has a high time requirement. You spend most of your time fine-tuning the problem set algorithms to get good results. The video lectures are great and entertaining for an introduction course to Computer Vision. The questions and answers are mostly managed by students with some participation from the TAs. There is a consistent TA availability for office hours which really helps when solving the problem sets. \n\nThis course is an easy B but a hard A. It is important to do the best you can to get a high grade in the problem sets so you have more points to spare in the final test. I strongly recommend watching all the videos even if the problem sets don't require them. This will help you in your final as it covers more units than the PS. \n\nThe instructor is mostly absent during the course. We got a welcome, a good-bye, and a few messages in between. However, you will learn a lot from the video lectures and the TAs. I wish we had a couple of live Q&A sessions with the professor. \n\nWhen you finish this course, you will definitely have learned a lot and feel stronger in this field.  About me: No CS background. No experience with Python or OpenCV (beginner experience with Java). However, I have a strong math background, and it helped me a lot. \n\nLectures: There are a lot of lecture videos. Toward the end of the class (hw 7 and 8), some of them are not needed to do the hws. However, I strongly advise against skipping any videos (cause you'll need to go through them for the final). The lectures contain a lot of mathematical proofs and derivations, so it might get a little dry. However, Professor Bobick did an excellent job of explaining them as well as the concepts and intuition behind all the math. \n\nHomework: There are 8 hw sets. HW1 is only 4% because it is easiest. Other hws are 11% each. In my opinion, HW2 and HW7 are the hardest (so get started early on these). In general, the difficulty of the hws is not in the coding, but it is the parameters. Getting the code to pass the autograder is not a difficult task. However, you'll have to pick the right parameters to produce the right images for the report (the reports consist mostly images and sometimes, short discussion, not essays). Optimizing the code was also a problem for me because I had no CS background. Overall, I don't consider the homework super-difficult. \n\nOther comments: Piazza and Slack are valuable resource, so take advantage of them. Most of the time, when I got stuck at something, the answer was in one of the Piazza's posts. Also, do watch the Youtube Office Hour videos. The TA explains how to do the hws very clearly and in detailed in those videos. Best class out of the 5 courses I took so far. Project2 to Project7 are intense, have to do a couple all-nighter along with helpful peer students on Slack. Office hours are extremely helpful as well. Definitely learnt a ton and recommend to everyone in the program. \n\nThe only critique I got is that most of the technologies covered are fundamentals for modern technology, although important, there is very little coverage on recognition, machine learning/deep learning, which is what the industry is using nowadays. I had to spend the summer after the class to self-learn these skills from online resources to get prepared for interview questions. In fact, we talked about this at the end of the semester through Pizza and I'm very glad that the instructors and TAs are open to hear our thoughts. I noticed that the Fall 17 version has allocated 1/2 of the semester to recognition&Deep Learning. Not sure if this is only for on-campus students, but I really wish we covered that in our class. (mid term review)... I really enjoy the class. Lots of great high-quality material and good projects to work on. CompPhoto is a good pre-req, but be aware that this is a lot more detailed, in depth, and time consuming. I agree with the 'class seems to be on autopilot' comment above. The new course instructor rarely participates in piazza, and I found TA participation unreliable and inconsistent. Lectures are good, but there is alot of material to cover. I've found myself skipping portions due to time constraints. With all that, I'd still recommend the class, but be aware of what you're stepping into with respect to available time.  First semester with a new instructor. This class looks to be run entirely by TAs. You mostly will get majority of support from fellow classmates. \n\nThe lectures are great. Actually the best out of the 7 courses I've taken (IOS AOS CN KBAI CP AI4R). \nYou can sink a lot of time if you want to fully understand all the math - I did research on my own when I fail to grasp the material as presented. But you can also just rewatch the lecture to know enough to get by (i. e. finish all the assignments and complete the final). \n\nSo how time consuming is up to you - do you want to master the material or just to know enough to be dangerous. FYI I put in 20 hours / week for this course. \n\nYou want to know python before you begin. You can spend a weekend or two on lynda. gatech. edu - they have some great introductory videos. In this course you'll use a lot of numpy and opencv, it's also a good idea to get familiar with numpy first. \n\nGrade breakdown:\nForum Participation: 4%\nExam : 15% (40 questions / 2 hr unproctored open book)\nAssignments: 81%\n\nTo get an idea whether this will be too difficult for you, you can sample the assignments here:\n\nhttps://www. udacity. com/wiki/ud810?r=agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chkLEgxXaWtpUmV2aXNpb24YgIDQ05rW7gkM\n\nps1 Images as Functions (warm up)\n\nps2 Edges and Lines (first serious assignment, you'll have a good idea of how time consuming the rest of the assignments are - start early)\n\nps3 Window-based Stereo Matching (very time consuming parameter tuning, lookup numpy as_strided)\n\nps4 Geometry (medium difficulty)\n\nps5 Harris, SIFT, RANSAC (medium difficulty)\n\nps6 Optic Flow (very time consuming parameter tuning)\n\nps7 Particle Tracking (one of the easier assignments)\n\nps8 Motion History Images (easiest assignment)\n\n\nHere's the TOC of the lectures to give you a high level overview of what you'll learn in this class\n\nhttps://cs6476. wordpress. com/\n\n01A1 Introduction\n02A1 Images as functions\n02A2 Filtering\n02A3 Linearity and convolution\n02A4 Filters as templates\n02A5 Edge detection- Gradients\n02A6 Edge detection- 2D operators\n02B1 Hough transform- Lines\n02B2 Hough transform- Circles\n02B3 Generalized Hough transform\n02C1 Fourier transform\n02C2 Convolution in frequency domain\n02C3 Aliasing\n03A1 Cameras and images\n03A2 Perspective imaging\n03B1 Stereo geometry\n03B2 Epipolar geometry\n03B3 Stereo correspondence\n03C1 Extrinsic camera parameters\n03C2 Instrinsic camera parameters\n03C3 Calibrating cameras\n03D1 Image to image projections\n03D2 Homographies and mosaics\n03D3 Projective geometry\n03D4 Essential matrix\n03D5 Fundamental matrix\n04A1 Introduction to -features-\n04A2 Finding corners\n04A3 Scale invariance\n04B1 SIFT descriptor\n04B2 Matching feature points (a little)\n04C1 Robust error functions\n04C2 RANSAC\n05A1 Photometry\n05B1 Lightness\n05C1 Shape from shading\n06A1 Introduction to motion\n06B1 Dense flow- Brightness constraint\n06B2 Dense flow- Lucas and Kanade\n06B3 Hierarchical LK\n06B4 Motion models\n07A1 Introduction to tracking\n07B1 Tracking as inference\n07B2 The Kalman filter\n07C1 Bayes filters\n07C2 Particle filters\n07C3 Particle filters for localization\n07C4 Particle filters for real\n07D1 Tracking considerations\n08A1 Introduction to recognition\n08B1 Classification- Generative models\n08B2 Principle Component Analysis\n08B3 Appearance-based tracking\n08C1 Discriminative classifiers\n08C2 Boosting and face detection\n08C3 Support Vector Machines\n08C4 Bag of visual words\n08D1 Introduction to video analysis\n08D2 Activity recognition\n08D3 Hidden Markov Models\n09A1 Color spaces\n09A2 Segmentation\n09A3 Mean shift segmentation\n09A4 Segmentation by graph partitioning\n09B1 Binary morphology\n09C1 3D perception\n10A1 The retina\n10B1 Vision in the brain Content - Very dense and overwhelming. Videos are sufficient (books not needed). Engaging and tactfully glosses over the math-heavy parts so that you are not totally lost without trivializing it too much. NOT very relevant in terms of current state of technology used in the field. \n\nProf and TAs - The Prof made exactly 1 appearance and TAs were not very prompt. It would have made a lot of difference if the prof and/or TAs could use office hours to augment the video content with current day relevance, or expand on difficult topics etc. Because of lack of their involvement, the experience was not very different from watching yet another MOOC video. \n\nAssignments - There were 6 - barring a couple, most very fairly hard. Success in this course is just a function of time you put in. Sometimes I had to watch the same lecture more than 5 times to spot what mistake I may have made in the implementation.\n\nFinal Project - Very time consuming, but it is the only time you can work on a non-cartoon problem and get exposure to industry standard problems and solutions\n\nPeers - Very very helpful. I survived a couple of assignments thanks to many of their suggestions. \n\nOverall, if you are interested in the subject, you must take it. It does a very good job at introducing you to the fundamentals. But you need to work on your own to fill in the gaps between the state of the art in 2015 and 2018. \nBetter administration could make this a MUCH better course.  This was an excellent class; very interesting lectures and course material.  Dr. Bobick's lectures are fun to watch and he does a good job of explaining the topics.  There were about 30 hours of lectures which seems like more than some of the other classes in the program.  It's important to watch them before working on assignments since the implementation steps for some of the problem sets are directly given in the lectures.  The TAs were great at releasing the problem sets and grades on a regular 2 week schedule.  Matthew Houston also gave well prepared office hours that he recorded weekly which were very helpful.  The final project had 5 possible topics and requires a lot of work; my advice is to limit your scope initially because you may otherwise try something too ambitious and not be as pleased with your results.  The open note final was pretty straightforward.  Taking CP first was very helpful for me since I hadn't touched python in a decade and I wrote more code for the traffic sign detection problem set than I did in all of CP (including my final project).  The overlap in some of the topics with CP also helped me feel more comfortable in completing the CV problem sets.  I really enjoyed the class and wish there were more CV classes to take. The instructor of record is Prof Essa, but the videos were produced by Prof Bobick before he left GT.  The videos and accompanying slides are really remarkable.  For most of my classes, you can find better video lectures online covering the same subjects.  Bobick's material is voluminous and high quality.  It represents a really unique contribution to online learning.  The volume of lectures is similar to a traditional lectures class -- probably 3 hours a week -- and it takes some effort to keep up.  There are a lot of assignments.  Expect to turn in a mini-project every two weeks with a full project at the end (given three weeks to accomplish).  The TAs, Matt and Pedro, are fantastic.  Prof Essa only posted a few times in the forum and didn't hold office hours.  The class is really well worth the time you spend on it in my opinion.  It's the highest quality of the seven classes I've taken. This is a great class. In our section Piazza and the TAs were very helpful. I don't believe the instructor of record posted much on Piazza. Make sure you brush up on python, numpy, and linear algebra before you take it. There is some simple calculus, but mostly linear algebra. If you're not comfortable with matrices and their operations some of the projects will be difficult. Projects 2 (hough), 6 (optical flow), and 7 (particle filters) were the most challenging and time consuming. The final was open book/notes and covered all sections of the lecture. It wasn't difficult if you covered all of the lectures and mostly stuck to higher level questions than minutiae. The one thing I really disliked about this class, and computer vision in general, is the parameter tuning/fitting. One will spend a lot of time doing that for the projects in this class to make things work. The most difficult thing for me was keeping up with the lecture/notes while also doing the projects. It was easy to get behind.  Very nice class on good old fashioned computer vision. No convolutional neural networks in this class (except for the final project, if you so desire!) but you will get to learn many of the cool insights that computer vision researchers came up with before deep learning was a thing, and that's still quite valuable.\n\nOverall the assignments are very interesting and cover a wide array of CV techniques. One of them (I believe assignment 2) is a lot more time consuming than the others, but overall they are all reasonably sized. Be careful about the final project though! If you take the deep neural net project, lots of people had trouble getting it to work in the required amount of time (fortunately I managed to do it). Took this as my first OMSCS class, without prior Python or OpenCV knowledge and sketchy Linear Algebra. It's a great class, hard but for all the right reasons. Very well organized, and a fair grading scheme. No grading on a curve so everyone cooperates on Piazza (within the 'no sharing code' constraint).  I could feel myself learning as the course progressed. Mind blowing feeling to go from knowing nothing, to knowing, uh.. something (Prof. Bobick style joke), and as an added bonus you will develop an internal clock that always knows AoE time. What makes the course hard? The sheer volume of videos to watch and assignments to complete in a short 17 weeks. Here's my time breakdown by week measured by Toggl, so you can schedule your accordingly: 18, 20, 24, 26, 22, 31, 32, 21, 16, 15, 24, 24, 23, 14, 50, 31, 16. That 50 is not from leaving the timer running by mistake - it's the time I packed in attempting to do the final project which I found incredibly difficult. The week before that with only 14 hours was the one I spent flailing around, despairing of being able to do the final project. Advice for others 1. Don't fall behind on watching the lectures! Watch them all before doing the assignments - even without taking notes and/or at 2x speed. They might seem to not be connected to the assignments, but they open up your mind to things that will help you do the assignmets - and certainly will make a big difference preparing for the exam. 2. Start assignments the minute the day they are released. Don't procrastinate because usually success in the assignments (especially if you're a newbie) is more a function of time than anything else. 3. Make an effort to post questions to the Office Hours, or be familiar with the assignment so you can benefit more from them - Mathew Houston's recorded OH were extremely helpful. 4. In the assignments, strive for 100% because the final project is 5 times harder than any assignment and you have only 3 weeks to complete it (took me about 85 hours to turn in something not so great), so it's likely to bring your grade down.\nSome criticism: The assignments have a lot of starter code written for you, so you can learn Python and OpenCV as you go along, however, it would have helped if the Matlab quizzes in the lectures were replaced with OpenCV ones (but Pedro the TA did provide OpenCV versions for some of them). The biggest criticism is that because of the final project, there are no assignments on the later sections and I didn't feel like I really learnt them. \"Pros: The lectures are detailed and very informative. They provide a solid basis that can be used to build upon more advanced CV concepts. The assignments despite being time consuming are a valuable learning experience. \nCons: The class seems to be in autopilot and the professor involvement is minimal. The assignments need to be spread out a bit to balance out the workload across the semester. As mentioned above the lectures are indeed detailed but they are also lengthy. \" This class was intense and difficult, but it was also a lot of fun.  Very interesting material that was presented in a clear and sometimes entertaining way.  It did seem like they tried to cram a lot of lecture material into one semester.  Even the projects didn't cover the last several groups of lectures.\n\nFinal project was very difficult but it depends on your skill level and topic you choose, I guess.  I was burnt out by that time from everything else going on plus the holidays, so I bombed pretty badly near the end.  Still ended up with a high B in the class since I did well on the projects up to that point.  Just stay on top of your stuff and you'll be fine.\n\nI loved this class and absolutely recommend it.  I don't recommend pairing it with another course and I don't recommend it as a first OMSCS course if you've been away from academia for a while. This was my favorite OMSCS class yet. The projects and material are extremely interesting. Be prepared to spend a most of your time working on problem sets and tweaking parameters to get the perfect result. Also, be prepared to have your mind warped by some of the math involved. If you are familiar with Python and Numpy, you will be in a good position when you start this class. I myself was not a Python / Numpy expert, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me there too. \n\nLike others have mentioned, this class was recently taken over by a new professor who did not participate on Piazza a lot. You will have to lean on your fellow classmates and TAs if you get stuck. Other than that, this class is awesome. I highly recommend it. It might be painful at times but, if you push through, you will be glad you did. I learned a ton in this class.  Excellent course. Prof got a humor. Lectures are fun to watch, but long. Anybody interested in computer vision would enjoy this course. Only downside is that the course is LONG~~~~~~~~~ I think it's covering too much material in one term. I would have enjoyed much more if this class could be broken down into two terms.  This was a challenging course, and a time-consuming one.  I still generally liked it, however, since I ended up learning a lot.\n\n**Dislikes**\n* Lots of lectures, not all are really great. They could have better explanations.\n* Some homework felt like parameter-tuning busywork.\n* Usual gripes with unengaged professor and hit-or-miss TAs.  YMMV on the TAs.\n* Final project is potentially HARD, depending on what you choose.  Over this period of time I spent around 120 hours on it over 2.5 weeks, on top of working full time, and still did not end up with a product I was very proud of.\n\n**Likes**\n* Concepts were really fun.  Useful for applications from robotics to search to AR, etc...\n* We did learn a lot.\n* Final project option included convolutional neural networks, which are close to the state of the art in the field.  Most grad classes start with \"historically important\" primitive concepts that are then built up into larger, better systems, and never get to the true state of the art in the field.  It was awesome to have the option to learn about these a bit.\n\n**Bottom Line**\nHard class, big time commitment, learned a lot, would still take again. CV is a great course - well designed, challenging, lots of materials to cover. TAs are amazingly supportive with plenty of office hours (don't skip them), though the prof is never around. Being disciplined is a must - start all the problem sets as soon as you can and familiarize yourself with Python, Numpy, OpenCV functions. This is the BEST class I took. Excellent materials and professor! You need to be very familiar with python, probability, and linear algebra. The homework focus on programming your own functions based on the algorithms discussed in class instead of using existing functions. This really helps you to better understand how these famous algorithms work. Every two weeks I had to submit my programming project, so the time was tight and painful, but l could still handle it and definitely learned so much. I recommend this class to everyone. Class is almost completely on \"auto-pilot\" and new instructor is like \"absentee landlord\". Instructor and TA's participation on Piazza is minimal and limited to administrative issues, if any. Lectures themselves, created by original instructor are very informative and actually entertaining. There is a lot of material to cover, and assignments are time consuming and difficult to implement, since most of time, results are vary from run to run. There are several changes coming with new instructor: all assignments are to be implemented in OpenCV Python, although examples in the lectures are in Matlab. Grades are \"artificially suppressed\" - 100%=90%\nWork is front loaded - there are four assignments coming every week in the first month or so. It is actually good part, so you can drop a class early, if it does not work out. I came with Matlab experience and mandatory use of OpenCV came as a surprise, although Python with numpy, scipy and OpenCV packages turned out quite Matlab-ish. I am glad, I stayed. Classmates are great and there is a lot of help to be found on Piazza, actually I am learning the most from my classmates.  Loved the content and subject. But lot of effort needs to be put in for the assignments, be prepared upfront to spends your weekends on it. Generally this course is pretty good. I did struggle on some of the projects because I spent too much time on figuring out the best parameters. I learned a lot on computer vision. The lectures are cool and I found CV is really useful. This course is both extremely challenging and extremely rewarding. The projects are very hard, but every one of them was something I've always wanted to know how to do - actually getting them implemented and learning how it all works is just incredible. The lectures cover an extremely wide range of topics, while there is sometimes more of an emphasis on the math than the intuition, you come away with a lot. \n\nThe projects you work on in this course are some of the coolest things I've ever worked on. If they offered another CV course with more projects like this, I would take it in a heartbeat. Seeing the output of an algorithm that you implemented to track a hand in a video for example, that's just awesome. \n\nThe time requirement is very real. The 2nd project, which turned about to be the longest, took me about 60 hours to complete. The math and linear algebra can be intimidating, and if it wasn't for the community on Piazza I don't think I would have figured out how to do certain things. As difficult as it is, the grading is very honest and the TAs are extremely helpful - if you put in the effort you will succeed. \n\nThis is a very challenging course but it is 100% worth it. I would HIGHLY recommend learning numpy and at least brushing up on opencv basics before taking this course. I think a better understanding of numpy and \"vectorization\" in particular would have saved me a ton of headache in the first half of the course. Also, I did not do this, but I wish I had taken Computational Photography first. There were a few posts on Piazza about how much that helped.  Really good and challenging class. Math heavy but appliation oriented as well. You get to see the results of what you have learnt. \nFor instance, you detect shapes in images, track the movement of a subject in videos, identify motion etcetera. Brush up on your\nLinear algebra. Prior Matlab knowledge is defintely helpful, although you can complete the problem sets using python as well. Prof. \nBobick and team were awesome, grading was quite liberal and I think everyone in the class was satisfied.  Very good class, but excessive work load. Some of the algorithms they teach are outdated. For those without a background in machine vision, Computational Photography serves as a prerequisite. School needs to offer more electives in machine vision. As of today, this class is not part of an existing specialty.  This is a challenging course with tons of math that I could never remember by heart, but very rewarding and learned a lot. When the website says majority of the learning would come from doing the problem sets, that's very accurate. I highly recommend taking this course and suggest start on each problem set well in advance. If you haven't taking Computational Photography, I would recommend taking that first. It would serve as a very good prep course.  So glad I took this class. The lectures are well done, but sometimes I felt myself in the dark because the math seemed way over my head. I have a minor exposure to linear algebra, and a strong exposure to calculus and I still found most of the math over my head. Some things that would be good to know ahead mathmatically: eigenvalues, gradients, sum of square differences, minor exposure to supervised and unsupervised machine learning, physic in motion and illumination, signal and frequencies, and of course the basic matrices and vector operations. The problem sets are the core of your grade and will vary in time commitment. I found ps1, ps4, ps5, ps6 to be the most time consuming having to work over 20 hours on each. The problem sets focused on creating the algorithms for the computation as well as modifying them to optimize your results, so it could get frustrating tweeking the inputs and variable of your algorithms. The professor of the lectures definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CV and a bit of his personality made the lectures very enganging. It's important to take notes for the lectures because at the end of the course there will be an exam and it is a pain have to go back through all the lectures as it was for me. The exam seemed fair. The instructor and TAs are helpful on piazza. And of course other students were very helpful. The office hours were helpful as well, I only had one problem with an office hour where I was the only student there and the TA was very unresponsive, but that was the exception to the rule. Take this course if you want to become interested in Computer Vision because you will once you take this course. The only thing I wish they had done for this course was post solutions to the problem sets after the deadlines.  This is one of the most well designed classes you'll come across during your time with OMSCS, seriously! I've taken a few other classes before and they all had a major disconnect between lectures and assignments -- the lectures were very thin compared to what was expected and a lot of self researching was needed. Dr. Bobick really does care about teaching this subject and wants you to understand and appreciate it fully and this shows easily in his lectures, which are formatted logically and are exhaustive (well, atleast for an intro course.. ). The TAs are very knowledgeable and helpful, made good comments when assignments were returned. \n\nRegarding the content of the course, much of your time will be spent on parameter tuning rather than implementing concepts and algorithm (especially in problem set 2, the hardest one IMO). So it is a good idea to play with the parameters early in the course and get an understanding of how they change the results. It does get a bit math intensive towards the middle and latter part of the course so brushing up on your linear algebra would go a long way. The final was open-book and was quite easy and straightforward sticking to higher level questions than mundane specifics. \n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this class to bits and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to dive into this wonderful and nascent field! Thought the course was good overall. I think the assignments though (value of the content vs time needed to spent on it) could be improved. Some assignments I spend like 20-30 hours just for just one question where on a different assignment, it would of taken me only 15 hours to do the whole thing. In general, way too many video lectures and content to cover in a single semester. \n\nI think shrinking the videos used for the course by 20% would be more fitting given the length of a semester. Great introduction to computer vision, but doesn't go into depth into anything. \n\nThe final is strange as the assignments don't really prep for some of the details required to get a good grade. \n\nI don't think the Peer Feedback component of the course helps at all, never read the feedback people gave me. \n\nThe Prof is completely hands off, letting the TAs run the course. The TA quality is odd, in the sense, I found some TAs extremely involved and helpful with some almost leaving me wondering what they were doing there at all. The course material is old. Dont expect to learn anything state of the art. However, some concepts are important IMO.\n\nThe worst part about this course is the professor. Prof. Irfan Essa, is one of the rudest professors I have seen in academics. His presence in the class is negligible; the course would be better off if it was none. The only time he appeared on Piazza was to let students know that \"the TA's are not supposed to answer students questions\" \nI have seen Coursera and Community college professors more enthusiastic and involved in their courses. \n\nMy suggestion: Wait until the prof is changed.  This class is extremely well done. The lectures go in depth into many different areas of CV. Some of the projects are tough. Project 2 and 7 were the hardest for me and took 35-40 hours. The lectures are long and go into the math consistently. Excellent introductory course to computer vision. The video lectures are pretty long but equally interesting. Prof. Bobick makes it so captivating. Its almost like he is telling you a story. He breaks down the hard math part pretty well. This course covers more math than many other courses so be prepared for that (ref:http://omscs. wikidot. com/courses:cs6476). The problem sets are many(1 introductory & 7 advanced... kind of) and can be pretty tough. Thanks to Pedro (TA) for breaking it down for us. I've completed 5 courses so far & have not come across another TA more helpful & passionate than Pedro. I'll credit him as much as Prof. Bobick for this course. \nYou'll learn a lot on fundamentals of CV, it's applications. You'll definitely learn a lot of Numpy tricks & openCV. \nOverall an excellent course if you are aiming for CP&R specialization or in general curious about CV This was one of the most difficult yet most rewarding classes I've taken so far. The workload is fairly large. There are a lot of lectures to keep up with each week, along with a problem set due every two weeks. The problem sets vary in difficulty and level of effort. Some took me as much as 60 hours to finish. Nonetheless, the problem sets do a good job of reinforcing the material covered in the lectures and help you develop a deeper understanding of it. Plus, the problem sets are interesting. Many times after finishing a problem set I found myself staring at the results in amazement. How many people can say they've implemented an augmented reality system and facial recognition software? I cannot recommend this class more highly. The content of this course is really interesting, though it feels to me like too much for one course - 30 hours of dense lecture videos exceed any class I've taken so far. The six projects had two week windows (plus a 3 week final project) and typically required tremendous effort, an average of 40 to 50 hours, and a peak of 70 hours for me. They mostly started off pretty cool - the coding was fun, the outputs were impressive - but typically had was too many parts, such that by the end the joy was sucked out of them. PS2 about sign detection was particularly atrocious in this regard. It just had way too much packed in. A notable exception was PS3 on augmented reality, which had a more reasonable workload (~30 hours), which allowed it to be strictly fun. It's my understanding that they redid a bunch of the projects this semester and it sounds like they got harder. This also meant there were frequent bugs in provided code, though I'd imagine this will be less of an issue going forward if they keep the same projects. In my opinion this course would be better off either split into two courses or with a little less depth; I was just so fatigued by the end that I really didn't enjoy it, even though the content is fascinating.\n\nI am surprised by the recent review which commends the instructional staff - this course has objectively the worst instructor interaction of any of six courses I've taken thus far. For example, there are a combined 320 unanswered questions or unresolved followups on Piazza, roughly 10x the next worst class I've taken by this metric. The ratio of instructor responses to student responses is 0.642 - I've rarely (never?) had a class below 1.0. There were commonly bugs in project code that would be caught by students, and the instructors would not post updates or even make conspicuous announcements about the errors to save hours of pointless frustration for students on already tremendous projects. The one glaring exception to this trend were TA Matt Houston's office hours, which were excellent. The actual instructor, Dr. Essa, was completely absent - no office hours, no Piazza, etc. In fact, one of just two times he ever showed up on Piazza was to attack some students who implied that he was absent!\n\n\n\n\n Great class, I learned a ton, very difficult final project.  I suggest you have a strong grasp of numpy as you will not be able to complete the projects without it. Spectacularly well-run course. These TAs should be the golden standard for TAs everywhere. Assignment descriptions are very thorough and the starter code has plenty of helpful documentation. Matthew Houston is a godsend. His recorded office hours are incredibly helpful for understanding the assignments. I stress the recorded bit especially because it is not always convenient for everyone to watch live office hours. I have taken ML, AI, and RL before this class. RL TAs were fantastic (especially Miguel), ML was decent, and AI was not that great. Great TAs and documentation make a huge difference in the quality of a class. You do not want to spend hours trying to figure out what is being asked of you for assignments, or what the starter code is doing because there is a serious lack of comments.\n\nThe final project involves exploring state-of-the-art methods on computer-vision related problems. It was very demanding and time-consuming but well worth the effort. There were several topics to choose from this semester, with accompanying specific instructions. \n\nA guide was also issued for the final exam. This was some of the densest material I\u2019ve studied. The lectures were interesting, but so packed with material that it was difficult to absorb. Grade was determined based on 8 problem sets (partially auto-graded), peer feedback, and a final exam. Thankfully, the problem sets supplemented the material quite well, and helped me to understand some of the math and concepts that were discussed in the lectures. Even so, without a fantastic TA (Pedro) who hosted office hours every week to talk about issues in the problem set, this class would have absorbed much more time. To get over a 95% on the problem sets, you had to put in some work to show going \u201cabove and beyond\u201d what was assigned. Typically, this took the form of an additional \u201cchallenge problem\u201d in the assignment. These problems usually were parameter-tuning extensions of the original assignment, but could take several hours to complete. I should also note that several assignments required some amount of parameter tuning, which some find tedious and boring. While this may be true, it does accurately reflect the nature of the field. \n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class to take. I felt I learned a lot of applicable material, but also felt like I had not absorbed most of what was discussed in the lectures simply due to my time constraints (also took CCA and ML4T this semester). Like most classes, you get out of it what you put into it. The professor makes the lectures great. The problem sets force students to understand the material in the lectures by having them implement the ideas shown. The results of the problem sets are visual, so its nice to see how tweaking parameters can change the way objects are detected or tracked. The p-sets are python with heavy usage in numpy and openCV. Linear algebra knowledge is key to getting things to work efficiently. \nThe final was timed on T-Square and open notes/book/lectures. The wording of the questions were a little tricky, so make sure you take your time and really understand what the questions are asking for. \nGreat course! Be mindful of your grades in this course, there is not really any curve. 88. 3% got me a B. Overall I liked the course. I had no former education in Computer Vision, and I thought all CV was basically ML, which turned out not to be true.\n\nThe projects are good and challenging. The lectures are very entertaining and well done. That's what saved the course for me. \n\nTA engagement was kinda poor, and the Prof. was absent for all the time and only showed up in the last few weeks of the semester. I owe all my learning to my fellow classmates. \n Lengthy video lectures and time consuming assignments ( mainly due to the need to tune parameters a lot). TAs were very helpful and course content is pretty good Very solid all-round class. 8 HWs due generally every other week, then an open note/book/internet final. You should be comfortable using python and numpy or at least able/willing to pick them up. Some math is covered, but mostly at a pretty superficial level. \n\nClass was more time consuming at times than difficult. A few of the HWs took more time than others because of needing to hyper-tune parameters to get optimal results. Lectures are very good, but I wish they focused a little more on depth than breadth. This class covers a ton of material, but mostly at a pretty shallow level, but this is of course to be expected from an intro survey course. \n\nNo involvement from the professor, but TAs were mostly very good. The video lectures are entertaining, although the materials are really many and can be tiring. \n\nThe second problem set was REALLY hard, at least for me. From that point on, things had been more manageable. \n\nFeedback on the assignment takes some time. \n\nYou will learn a lot from your classmates. \n\nI watched most of the lectures related to computations needed for the problem sets twice. \n\nWhile doing the problem sets, sometimes it feels like you're in the dark as you can be uncertain if you are doing the right thing. Sharing resulting images on Piazza has been really very helpful for me. \n\n(Update)\nTowards the end of the course, I got really burned out I stopped trying to arrive at the best parameters. My PS grades suffered. My final grade could have recovered by performing well in the final exam, but I was really too tired. When I looked at the exam feedback, I realized most of my mistakes were just because I misread them, but I actually know the answer. Not that the questions are not worded clearly, I was really just blurring out already when I was taking the exam. Looking back, though, maybe my fallout could have been much earlier if not for my supportive classmates. I did not appreciate early on the virtue of having Piazza graded, but I guess it helped in making students vocal and more active in providing support to each other. On the other hand, just a little more push could have given me an A. So my advice to those who will take this: do not give up. It is doable. Very difficult, but doable. And allocate your energy well, you will need it until the end.  Took this as my first course in OMS. I had almost zero experience in CV, but had a lot of experience in python and numpy.\nThere are a LOT of lectures. LOT of content to cover. The lectures were done by Prof. Bobick (who is no longer with GaTech), he makes the content interesting it by explaining concepts clearly and breaking difficult concepts into small, simple and easily digestible chunks of information.\n\nThere are 6 assignments, 1 final project and 1 exam (worth 15% of your grade). The assignments do a good job of covering all the important and interesting concepts of the course. Some assignments are difficult in the sense that - you can get it \"working\" relatively well, but to get the output they expect you'd have spend A LOT (extra emphasis on lot) of time parameter tuning.  The exam was open-book, but don't let that fool you! you still need to have a good grasp of a pretty much the entire syllabus to do well in the exam!\n\nThe final project requirements are not straightforward. There is a lot of emphases was placed on your report - you had to read papers and follow strict requirements for each project topic.\n\nThe TAs were helpful in Piazza in the beginning, but the activity kinda fell off after the first few assignments IMHO. Prof did not interact with the class via Piazza during my term. The Slack group was a godsend. Discussions on slack with other students was what helped me through the assignments.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting course. CV is a very widely-applicable subject and I suggest if you are planning on having a career or doing research in ML or similar fields, do take this subject! This was one of my first classes in the program (along with [Computer Networks](/courses/6250))... I learned a lot in this class... but I feel like I could've learned more if we had the option of sharing code with others.  Without certain necessary numpy skills some projects would take hours to run.\n\nFor my final project I spent probably 120 hours on it and got it so that each \"pass\" would run ~8 seconds each, but I know other students got it down to single seconds each... but we couldn't share code. A very challenging class, but also really interesting. The projects really make you work to understand the coding behind computer vision and much of the difficulty with it. In the end, though, you wind up making code that tracks objects in videos which was really interesting and fun. The lectures are very informative and really fun as well. This course was terrible, please just take a course on Coursera instead.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Valuable hands on experience with Numpy and OpenCV.\n2. The lack of TA support meant I met a lot of cool people via Slack.\n3. The course material has been refined over many semesters.\n4. You get to choose between several topics for the **massive** final project\n\nCons:\n\n1. Prof Irfan is a joke (i.e. no interaction from the professor at all).\n2. The projects are absurdly difficult; the TAs are useless and do not answer questions.\n3. There are 40 hours of lecture videos. They could easily have condensed the content to 10 hours. There is so much irrelevant content that they waste your time with. \n3. The rubrics for each project are HIDDEN from you; you will be graded by that rubric and lose points.\n4. At the end of the day, the topics you get from this course are not very useful. Just buy a book on CV and read it.  I took this as my very first OMSCS course by itself, and it was the perfect choice for that.\n\nOne of the TAs described this course as \"a whirlwind tour through Computer Vision\", and I think that is a very good synopsis. It focuses on \"classic\" (pre-deep learning) computer vision, though there is a final project option that uses KNNs. The lectures are countless (after I completed the first one, I thought I was done for the week, but then I looked at the syllabus and realized it was only one out of five for the first week) and dense, so you get a thorough understanding how each presented method works. Not much fluff or handwaving going on here, Prof. Bobick will explain the algorithms and the math involved in detail.\n\nThe problem sets are challenging and time consuming, but also well-designed and motivating. At the end of each of them you'll have something quite impressive to show to your friends or co-workers. About half the problem set points are awarded by the autograder, and the other half comes from the report which mostly consists of images and/or video generated by your code. So if you get all the points from the autograder, you're almost guaranteed to get an A. So the outcome of the course is quite binary: either you don't \"get\" the material or your coding skills are insufficient and you drop half-way through, or you're able to complete the problem sets and get an A or B (the exam being the wildcard). Speaking of the exam, it was open-everything and unproctored, but still quite challenging. The assignments are only released one at a time, so front-loading is not really possible. On the plus side, everyone is working on the same stuff, so the collaboration (on Piazza) is better.\n\nIn terms of pre-reqs, make sure to brush up on Linear Algebra (you should at least know what a system of linear equations is, for example). A little bit of Computer Graphics knowledge is also helpful, but not required. I did Pryby's \"Linear Algebra Refresher\" on Udacity in advance, which taught me Python and Linear Algebra at the same time (without numpy, which I picked up during the course).\n\nIf you have a full-time job, I would definitely recommend not taking a second course with this one (unless maybe if you're a numpy master who does singular value decomposition in his head for fun). This class was extremely well done, so well done in fact that I was able to get through it, and understand the material, without knowing any of the required math. The lectures were engaging and the material is fascinating. Professor Bobick explained and simplified the math so well that it didn't matter I didn't have the math prerequisites, I could still do the assignments well. \nSome bad news, you must know MATLAB or Python well or expect to spend a huge amount of time learning one of them in parallel to the class. I spent 50+ hours on the first real assignment due to struggles with MATLAB and learning to think about vectorizing code instead of writing for loops. If you can't vectorize or do list comprehensions etc. in Python you will not be able to get some code to run fast enough to be usable on assignments. It is still hard, assignments regularly took 30 to 40 hours for me even after learning MATLAB & Python.  The best one among the 8 courses I have taken so far. Great homework projects, which really helped understanding the course concepts and givers us a chance to practice the algorithms learned in class. The course video is extensive and covers a lot of concepts, while still being clear. The instructor is very energetic and humorous, I really enjoyed watching the videos. the projects may be time consuming and difficult, though. You need to understand the algorithms, and have solid programming skill to implement it. This course made me question my sanity.  The assignments are So.  Hard.  I have a degree in computer science and 4 semesters of calculus, but still could not decipher the mathematical formulas we were given to implement our code.  I easily spent 40+ hours a week, 20+ hours spent trying to decipher the assignment.  Some people claimed they finished assignments (even the final!) in 3 days - I spent every spare minute on my computer from the minute assignments were released to the hour the assignment was due, and I was still lucky to get a B.\nThe course is great, really.  I loved watching the videos, and you learn some fantastic state-of-the-art stuff, like sensing road signs for self-driving cars, to how to create special effects like you see in the movies.  The difficulty comes from being asked to implement these things using just the math.  You've introduced to the topic, the theory explained, the math given and explained, and then off you go!  The problem is that none of that gives you an algorithm to implement.  I found it incredibly frustrating to interpret the math, and in the end had to conclude half of it was nonsense, unless that large 'E' symbol means something other than sum, and every time they ask you to subtract the mean (average), they are just kidding.\n\nIn the end the only reason I passed was because I ignored the formulas, looked at code off the internet, and got the source code for the openCV functions we weren't allowed to use, and painstakingly over several days, went line-by-line through the dense C++ code, figured out what it was doing, where it matched with the formula we were given, where it didn't, and rewriting everything into python.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of time, don't take this course.  You cannot skip a lecture, and will probably end up watching all of them several times, rewinding to go over some dense explanation.  If, however, you do have the time, want to learn some amazing skills, and can decipher mathematical equations with ease, you will love this course. The assignments were disjointed at the start of the semester and the autograder was really fickled. TA may have been overloaded or just very not communicative. I think they were transitioning from MATLAB to Python and had a learning curve. \n\nThe programming was hard but fair. The frustration was figuring out the assignment parameters and that consumed more time that I had available. I had too many other time commitments to pour the extreme hours to overcome the issues in assignments. Dropped course to focus on my other one.  This is a great course if you like applying what you've learned. The instructor and TAs are awesome in conveying the material and responding to questions on the forums, though sadly, it appears that our current instructor Professor Bobick will no longer be actively in the forums in future semesters since he has accepted a new position. Grade is based on projects and a final exam. Projects are done in Python, MATLAB, or Octave, (your choice) so be sure you have a good handle on one of them (preferably not Octave, since you get MATLAB for free in Georgia Tech). An important thing in this class (and in any other) is to set enough time to watch the lectures and read the materials and do the homework. I've learned many times during this semester that I always need to take some breaks in order to 'get it' and go forward to the next step of the problem. So yeah, if you put aside the time, I think you should be fine. There is also a good amount of linear algebra, but I reckon it shouldn't be an issue if you've taken an undergraduate linear algebra/discrete mathematics course.  The class consists of 8 projects and a final. The projects range in difficulty, from really easy, done in 5 hours, to really time consuming and param fitting, which can take 20+ hours. Then comes the report you need to submit for each project, here you will see the fruits of your labor, but will also spend hours once you are done with the coding just getting the params and nuances of the algorithms to work perfectly with your images/videos. \nThe final was 35 multiple choice questions, if you compile all the slides back to back, and run through all the lectures once, it should be pretty easy. I studied for about 4 hours, compiled the slides, and hadn't watched the lectures in weeks, but still managed an 82. There were a whole bunch of questions that I easily could have gotten if I spent the time to re-watch all the lectures. \nOverall, I really enjoyed the class and the output from the later projects is really cool. \nDefinitely spend time getting to know python and numpy. Being able to run your code efficiently can change your runtime from hours to minutes or seconds. There is always a way to vectorize. \nThis class is nice, in that the lectures have everything you need, and they are directly applicable to the class. You will be implemented algorithms given in the lectures. This is a good intro into CV(OpenCV will be your new friend). The material is really dense and it covers a lot of relevant topics. You could spend upwards of 6+ hours every week to really grasp the weekly lectures. There are 6 bi-weekly projects which can easily eat up your time. So you may end up paying more attention to the lectures related to the project and skim the rest. The project implementation goes hand in hand with the lectures. Everything you need are in those wonderful Bobick lectures. Aaron Bobick's lectures are great. He keeps the topics engaging and breaks it down into understandable segments. The project topics covered a range from basics of image processing, hough transforms, homography, motion tracking, optical flow, classification, detection,etc.. One topic that was genuinely missing was deep learning methods like CNN, R-CNN (supervised learning SVM is part of the course). \n\nYou have 5 choices for your final project. This is seriously time intensive (depending on your topic). There is a CNN topic for the final project which gives you chance to dive right in on your own. I loved it however it would have been nice to have some of the concepts being part of the course. \n\nCons: The professor(Essa) was no where to be seen till week 8 or 9 after which he made a cameo appearance. All the lecture topics are slightly out dated. The TAs and their responses were mostly binary however there was a very active Slack group which kept my spirits up.  ### tl;dr\nChallenging & fun course. Great material. Course management: not great but not terrible.\n\n### Overall\nThis was my first semester in OMSCS. And my first college course in 20 or so years. I found the lectures pretty engaging overall. I had no experience with CV, no linear algebra since HS, limited experience with Python, numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras, so I learned a lot in this course. The problem sets were challenging. The specifications could have been clearer. I really struggled with the second problem set and wondered if I was cut out for the class. Then I discovered the Slack channel. Saved my life. Seeing how others approached the problem sets (and how they interpreted the sometimes vague, sometimes incorrect assignments) helped me not get too far into the weeds.\n\n### Problem sets\nA lot of the problem sets, at the heart of it, were translating formulas (and occasional algorithm flowcharts) to Python. Sometimes I understood the fundamentals, sometimes it was straight up transcription.\n\n### Course Management & Piazza\nPiazza was pretty much a dumpster fire. Hard to believe anyone would choose it as a tool. TAs were occasionally helpful, often terse. Lots of questions went unanswered. Trying to navigate Piazza made it not worth trying to get help. Prof. Essa was in absentia until the very end when people got upset. He was also disingenuous by suggesting he told TAs not to reply so students would help each other out. I'd have believed that if it wasn't offered as a *post-hoc* excuse. \n\n### Final project\nThe final project (I chose the CNN one) was very challenging. I learned a crap ton, even though my results were pretty much worthless. I thought I might have tanked it but ended up getting 100%. Probably because I documented it well in the paper. And because I did a lot of research up front and tried to base my approach on current research.\n\n### Exam\nExam was challenging but not terrible. Open book. Which was helpful. I spent a good half-day reviewing the lecture transcripts (helpfully put together by a fellow Slacker) and the lecture slides. Lots of `ctrl-f` of course. Managed to eke out a B on the final and a high B for the course. That included slacking for a week of vacation and getting a 61% on one of the problem sets.\n\n### Advice\n1. Make sure your linear algebra and calculus fundamentals are strong. It will help you truly understand the material.\n1. Make sure you have a pretty solid basis for numpy, especially how slicing and reshaping and such works. Lean on numpy vs. for loops.\n1. Spend a few hours at the start of the course getting a high level view of the history and current topics in CV.\n\n*note: my workload is based on actual measurements. I spent 171 hours on this course total including administrative work like registration, watching lectures, reading research papers, problem sets, peer review, final project, exam, time on Slack* CV's approach to problem solving is about tradeoffs. So coming in you will deal with some of the challenges head on. \nLearning the algorithm, writing the code, tweaking the params are just standard type of time consuming. \nHowever, because you are dealing with the ideal assumptions on which your CV algorithm model is based on, as applied to real world. This could mean needing to faster algorithm due to more tweaking. Changing your subproblem algorithms.. etc. \nHours of sleep == fast runtime == optimization\n\nThough I think the direction of the class seems to give more structure to the algorithm model so you can start with dealing the challenge of containing problem into the ideal assumptions rather than piecing the model from scratch. \n\nPay attention to the pre-req: linear algebra (eigenvalues) and some signals/ML(probability/stats) Requirements: Know some good python and numpy. So many ways to broadcast operations and indices (aka. vectorize), and you will use a lot of them. Good intuition of Linear Algebra helps a lot. Eigenvectors, projections, and so many linear tricks show up. For the first time in my life signal processing helped a bit. You might be able to get by without a background in either of these, but it's easier to understand if you've got this covered already. \n\nThe lectures are awesome, interesting, and in depth. There's 30 hours of them, so keeping up week by week is important. Projects every 2 weeks will keep you busy. Projects 2, Hough spaces, and 7, particle filters, are the most time intensive. Looking back, my ability to write python/numpy code has improved over the semester and project 2 would take me half the time now as it did earlier on. \n\nComputer Vision draws from pieces of so many other topics. Kalman and particle filters are covered in AI4R, graph cut and probabilistic algorithms in CCA, and supervised and unsupervised learning from ML. All of these are used, just applied to images and video. So you may get more out of the class after taking a few other classes. But it wouldn't be a bad first class, either, if you've got the time to commit to it, as the lectures explain everything you need. Lectures were dense and there were a lot of them. Overall the lectures were pretty good and interesting. \nThere were 7 projects. Second and sixth project were the most time consuming in my opinion, but not necessarily the hardest. A lot of the projects involve finding the perfect parameters to make things work and not so much programming. This was weird at first, but the point of the projects is really to teach you how the parameters affect the process. \nOne open note final exam. Basically it was just there to make sure you had a basic understanding of the lectures. \n\nI pretty much watched lectures Monday-Friday and worked on the projects over the weekend. 2 weeks for each project. Workload was inconsistent. Probably 12 hours a week most weeks with some scatterings of 20 hour weeks. Awesome class! It's heavy on math but it's a very rewarding class. Highly recommended! Awesome class, but it was a challenge for me. This was my only class for this term. Loved that I could do programming in Python and it was fairly well supported Great things to learn. Lectures are entertaining but problem sets are time consuming. Be prepared to spend a lot of time of them in order to get everything working perfectly. This sem we were not allowed to use MATLAB, only openCV was allowed, so python programming experience might help. Deadline policy is strict, and things can go out of hand if problem sets are left for the last minute. Think twice before combining it with ML or CCA.  Full disclosure: I actually dropped the course at the end of sept. I enjoyed the material however, I was disappointed the class had changed from using MATLAB and I was also very disappointed in the support/grading. It was very time consuming and despite the amount of time given, I ended up with about a 40-50 average and I was not the only one struggling.  Very good lectures, taking CP first here helped me for sure. Assignments are tough, as they leave a lot of implementation details up to you, and you have to tweak parameters to get your algorithms to work well. Overall, awesome course with really cool material.  I really enjoy this course. I am taking it concurrently with computational photography, and it has helped me get the most out of CP. There are overlaps in material, but it helps to reinforce it better. Piazza is a life saver with tons of participation, but never underestimate how long the assignments will take.  This course was challenging, and Piazza participation was very useful for making it through the problem sets. Conceptually, it's not terribly difficult, it's the implementation that get's tricky. Plus, the concepts aren't straight forward when it comes real world implementation. Some of the problem sets took me consecutive weekends, all weekend long. It's important to start early and stay active on Piazza.  Course lectures and projects were very entertaining and challenging. Projects are well defined. I suggest brushing up on linear algebra while taking the course as the later lectures are heavy in this area. Also be sure to comment and help in the forums, because participation actually matters. I lost 2% of my overall grade because I only made 70 comments in the forums -- the top student commented hundreds of times. The final was not super challenging and was a good reprieve from the rigor of the projects. The class is very interesting and well run with high TA involvement, however it is a challenging class. The assignments are frustrating until you understand what you are supposed to do, at which point they become really fun. You have to be comfortable with not having a set formula if you want to enjoy the class. A lot of your time will be spent tweaking parameters to fit your model. I am not a fan of the grading policy that if you do everything except the bonus you get a 90% and with the bonus 100%, however in the end as long as there is a curve to match the grade distribution they want I suppose it doesn't affect much.  This was an excellent course. I particularly liked the lectures, which were very entertaining in addition to the great content. The course page recommends a strong understanding of Linear Algebra, and that isn't a joke. The assignments are far easier if you have a solid understanding of the underlying math, and can translate that into efficient code. A good understanding of Python and Numpy will definitely help, but it is possible to pick up along the way. However, the assignments that would tend to benefit most from advanced knowledge of Numpy tricks are earlier in the semester. Community\n\nThe students in this class were very active on piazza and slack. A couple of the TAs were extremely helpful as well. The professor basically lets the TAs run the class. \n\nAssignments\n\nMost of the assignments in this class are difficult. For instance, I spent over 30 hours on assignment 2. The remaining assignments were not usually as bad. That being said, I got A's on every single assignment, so if you have the time to put into them, you should be able to do well. The assignments consist of both programming and a report. The reports have little writing, but it's a TON of parameter fitting. In some cases, finding the best parameters is harder than coding the algorithms. \n\nLectures\n\nThe lectures were informative and funny. However, there are so many of them that it is easy to be overwhelmed by them. Most of them are not directly applicable to the assignment, so there is a temptation to skip those. I do not recommend that. \n\nFinal\n\nThe final was weird. 15% of our grade, but it was under 40 questions. Most of the questions were not that hard. The study guide given to us covered most of it (though, no collaboration on the guide was allowed). In my opinion, if you found much of the lecture content going over your head, then it is absolutely necessary to study for the exam. \n\nSuggestions\n\nTo me, the #1 pre-req for this course is strong programming skills. Everything is done with Python, numpy, and OpenCV. If you don't know Python, this course could be a struggle for you. I picked up numpy and OpenCV during this class, but any experience with those tools will help you. #2, brush up on linear algebra. Many of the assignments require it. However, you'll find that the assignments explain much of it for you, and the TAs may help you with it during office hours. \n\nSo far, I have also taken KBAI, ML4T, SDP, and Networks. This class was significantly harder than all of those. I got an A, but it took many hours. The course material hasn't been updated in a while. The current professor is reusing the old professor videos without modification. The current professor also only appeared once or twice the entire semester and when he did he was unprofessional and extremely rude. He openly stated he told TAs not to help students with questions.\n\nWhile you will learn some interesting things, none of it will be state of the art, and you won't know whether you are even doing it the way it should be done due to non-existent teaching staff. Had this been my first class in OMSCS I would have regarded the entire program to be a scam and a joke.\n\nRead a book or watch youtube videos instead of taking this class - it will be less stress and more useful. The challenge with this class is the results of the assignments aren't meant to be good. Computer vision is hard and not perfect the course works to teach you the flaws of the basic methods. The more you run into the flaws the better understanding of Computer Vision you get. This is the math heavy version whereas Computational Photography is the application side of things.  Incredible class. The material is extremely interesting, and the assignments/project weren't overly difficult and really emphasized lecture material (although they were VERY time consuming). This was my first class in the program, but this course is probably one of the best courses I've ever taken! Including all of my graduate-level classes as well! Very rewarding, but very time-consuming.\n\nThere is a huge amount of material covered. It helps that Dr.Bobick's videos are not only incredibly well laid out and clear, but also quite enjoyable to watch. They're also very thorough, so as long as you can fit enough time to dedicate to lectures (4-6 hours a week) you'll learn quite a bit within each topic. Assignments matched the lecture material fairly well, and were for the most part well-defined and weren't too confusing.\n\nAssignment breakdown with estimated difficulty / time consumption for those that like this sort of thing:\nAssignment 1 -- easy; ~4-8 hours\nAssignment 2 -- hard; 40-60 hours\nAssignment 3 -- mid; ~25-40 hours\nAssignment 4 -- mid; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 5 -- mid/hard; ~30-40 hours\nAssignment 6 -- mid; ~20-30 hours\n\nWe had 2 weeks to complete each assignment, and they were always back-to-back so there was really no break in between. Previous offerings of the class seem to have had additional assignments, but starting this term we had a final project instead of the last (2?) assignment(s). The final project had a few selection options, to further explore more advanced and state-of-the-art algorithms for methods we used in assignments and/or other material presented in class that we didn't work on in assignments, and we were given 3 weeks to complete it. Many people thought there were too many things required to be completed for the projects, particularly the convolutional neural network project, so it could easily take 70+ hours to complete everything. A lot of the time spent on assignments and even on the final project is parameter tweaking. Be prepared to have fairly well designed algorithms in place, but spend loads of time tweaking parameter values to achieve optimal results.\n\nThe final exam was open-book and the study guide was very representative of what you needed to know for it. It was a fair exam. As long as you can review most, if not all, of the material beforehand, and find answers to all of the practice questions in the study guide, the exam is not difficult at all. Questions tended to be pretty base-level, focusing mainly on overall concepts and important algorithm details discussed in class. \n\nTAs were for the most part responsive, but as others have noted, Matthew Houston's office hours were a huge asset in completing the assignments. The forums were very helpful for finding out where to go when you were stuck and/or for discussing the assignments.\n\nI highly recommend this class, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it. It would help to review some linear algebra, and numpy if you aren't comfortable with using it yet. If you have some time, you could try and familiarize yourself with openCV 2.4 as well, as you'll be using this package a lot in the class. Don't wait until the last minute to start assignments, start on them early so it doesn't bite you when the deadlines approach! This course never claims to be similar to Stanford CS231n. It mostly teaches traditional (real) computer vision with machine learning element in some topics. (So I was a bit surprised that now it is a course of ML specialization). Personally I like this aspect more. There are a lot of smart ideas which inspire my ways of thinking. \n\nLinear algebra (a rough idea about what's happening) and numpy skills (vectorized operation) will help you with this course. And Be patient.\n\nRegarding the comment below that \"He openly stated he told TAs not to help students with questions\", I think the professor means(and he did say) that he encourages discussions instead of feeding you answers directly. My observation is that if I ask \"will I be punished if I use this function in my assignment\", TA will answer it very fast. But if I ask \"is algorithm A/parameter A better than algorithm B/parameter B for this assignment/project\", usually I will not get an answer from the TAs directly (but usually this issue has been discussed somewhere else in the post). I understand it might be a pain if you are rushing to a deadline but I think it's fair for effective learning. I learnt a lot by discussing problems with other classmates. But of course it would be better if TA/professor can give some conclusion remarks on some of the discussions. \n\nOverall after taking the course I respect computer vision more as a science.  I am glad the course is not designed to be an opencv or tensorflow tutorial. This course is strange. You will fall in love with it and hate it at the same time. The reason that you will love it is because you will employ mathematics like you never did before in real practice. You will hate it because you will see lot of mathematics which requires a very deep understanding of linear algebra. I mean real understanding of what matrices are, not just knowing the definitions or tricks to solve them. You will love professor Bobick and his humor during the lectures. His lectures were very useful to simplify things, and you won't appreciate his excellent explanation unless you try to read a CV book. I must admit, I didn't fully understand all the math behind many topics but I fully understood the intuition behind them. The beauty of this course is that you will have 8 problem sets which will teach the course literally. I enjoyed every problem set from 1 to 8. The only trivial one was PS1, but all subsequent problem sets will require many many hours of hard work. After this course, you will appreciate math and what it can do for you, appreciate ML and will strive to take any course related to it. In my opinion, this reflects the success of this course generally. If anyone want to take this course, then prepare yourself with enough Python knowledge and linear algebra since you will need them. Also, start any problem set as soon as you can and always check Piazza and slack group since you will find great community who will help and encourage you. I'm happy that I've taken this course as my first course since I've learned many great things and it also gave me enough enthusiasm energy to explore more about ML. Take this course and you won't regret it Tough but balanced class. Problem sets are very well designed to reinforce video lecture learning. TA office hours this term were superb. \n\nI think the workload could be smoothed out a bit, a couple problems sets are too much and some too easy. The problem set wording is thorough but a bit annoying at times, would be nice if words like 'easily', 'simply', etc were edited out of grad level problem set documents. They're unlikely to be true for most students and don't promote learning or good feelings after 12 hours into a tough problem. \n\nVideo lectures and class will need updating soon, though the lattter are great and highly watchable, the field is moving fast. Tough class, but interesting content and assignments. I previously took Computational Photography and felt like that was a good boost on some of the work. The material is dense, but the projects were all interesting (and challenging), and the final exam was open book so while very technical, it wasn't too crazy. Very interesting and useful class. I felt like the approaches to problems and techniques we learned translate well to a lot of other areas of machine learning outside of just computer vision and image/video-related domains. I feel like this area is definitely one that helped spawn a lot of the key concepts in classic machine learning. \n\nPython is used extensively, and you will want to learn how to effectively vectorize your code to avoid computationally expensive for-loops. Problem sets every couple weeks were generally challenging but not impossible. I felt like I learned a lot, and the class focused on the right things to get you to also focus on the concepts that matter the most. Good video lectures. I enjoy the class a lot. There is a lot of material in the lectures but it is interesting. It is heavy in linear algebra, and some calculus, though at a basic level. In the assignments you have to implement various computer vision algorithms, which sometimes can involve careful debugging of your matrices or indices, which means sometimes the assignments can take a long time if you get stuck tracking down small errors. Overall it is a fun course and one where you can learn many things (if you aren't already familiar with CV).  Lectures are of very high quality. All the assignments are hard but fun. I really enjoy this class.  A lot of the difficulty comes in implementation details. Concepts are explained well in the lectures and pdfs. (+1 @ above: Course timeline is still evolving, so there may be changes. Also, I updated difficulty from Average to Somewhat Difficult, after seeing the rest of the course) I learned a lot from the lecture slides and enjoyed implementing the techniques discussed in the lectures. With a background in engineering and a handful of years in software development, I found the assignments very straight forward. This is a hard course without good Python, linear algebra and computer vision foundations (like the Computational Photography class) knowledge. The video lectures are interesting, funny and clear, they are truly great lectures. However, I found the TA-ing not to be involved enough or maybe the flow of information itself was not enough. \n\nThe workload is quite heavy, there were a few assignments I spent 20+ hours on (just the coding itself). Grading is okay, though the requirements are not always 100% clear. Also the workload distribution is not even so be sure to jump into the assignments very early on, especially the first few. Another downside of the heavy workload that the TAs can't always keep up the pace either, some assignments took quite long to return and we had to submit at least 3 assignments before we got our first feedback. All these result in a lot of noise on Piazza, you have to go through 10K+ posts on piazza during the semester if you want to keep up. \n\nThey dropped MATLAB Fall2015, from now on you can only do your homework in Python. And unless you are good at Python (including advanced things like optimization and parallelization in NumPy), you'll spend a few nights debugging for sneaky bugs or screaming over algorithms that run for 40 minutes. \n\nAll in all: it is a good class but there is a room for some improvement. The material is great, the assignments are hard but rewarding.  This was a very hard course actually. Learned a lot but there was a lot of work. During the course of the class, I ended up spending most of my weekends on projects. The first project was a joke, and the second project was where the real sh*t hit the fan. I think project 2 was the weeder project and after that it seemed like a lot of people dropped out of the class. I would have to say it was interesting read the feedback from peer feedback from this class to something like KBAI. The feedback was always positive and supportive even if the project wasn't super great. I think we students struggle, they tend to try to help each other out.", 
    "CS-6505": " Chris Pryby, you are a disgrace of a professor. A stark mark of shame on the profession of teaching. To the OMSCS program director/coordinator who says that students cannot use outside sources? Chris Pryby! To list a few classes, in networking, software development processes, software architecture and design, I used more than what the text listed. I got the grade I EARNED by reading more than what was listed. A mentality of my way or the highway does not work in industry. To all who register for 6505, avoid Chris Pryby like the plague. You will do yourself, your learning, your career, and more importantly, your sanity a huge favor.   This class is very interesting, great TA support on Piazza, lot's of office hours (don't ask the TAs to record them, they have good reasons not to in this course, it's a touchy subject). BUY / RENT THE BOOKS. start homework EARLY. form study groups, practice solving the example final / midterm USING PEN AND PAPER. you have to pause the videos and do some intermediate steps on your own on pen and paper or it will make no sense to you. also add an excel with questions to next office hours. do not skip office hours. ask all the questions. this is why it is critical to start HW early, so you will have covered all questions. \nAim for an A in this course, but be aware that getting a B is not easy, and if you got a B, I would be happy with it. (I'm happy with mine and I really worked hard aiming for an A, got an A in the midterm, A on the HW but the final bent me down to a B. I'm still happy with it... ) Very tough course with lots of theory behind it. Professors and TAs were usually involved with the class. If you have a strong background in Math, this class shouldn't be too bad This class was fun! I had a LOT of fun learning things, doing the problems, and reading through the materials. I learnt quite a bit, too. It's a shame that this class is discontinued. This is a really tough course, specially if you don't have a strong background in algorithms and discrete math but if you like that kind of thing, this is for you. I had to put more hours in this course than any other I've taken but I was pretty motivated because I love that kind of stuff. In short if you are not into discrete math and set theory, maybe skip this if you can. Please notice I took it in Spring '15 so maybe things have changed by now. it takes a lot of repetitions and seeking out other sources to understand the material This is CS, not programming, which means it's taught like a math course. If you've ever taken a math class at the undergraduate level (something above calculus/any rigorous, proof-based course past middle-school geometry), you'll be fine. Get familiar with asymptotic notation and pseudocode syntax, and you'll be just fine. \n\nI have no formal CS background. I took one programming class in college, didn't like it, and majored in math. Later, I learned VBA for consulting, picked up some Java, and got myself a Dev position. And this is my first OMSCS class. But because I've taken math courses before, I've averaged 14/15 on the first four exams. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with how math classes are taught in universities, here's how they go:\nClaim: If [conditions], then [result]\nProof: Suppose [blah]. Then [... ]. Therefore, the claim is true. \nMoving on, \nNew Claim: [Stuff]\nProof: [Other stuff]\netc. \nYou'll get few examples per big concept, which means one or two per lecture. Expect to do most of the puzzling through the implications on your own, though the (ungraded) homeworks help put you in the right mindset and give you practice. \n\nIf you've never taken a math class at the university level, you're going to start out at a loss. Prep. Learn the difference between an intuitive argument (It works for these three examples, so I'm pretty sure it should always work. Besides, it just makes sense, you know?) and a rigorous one (For all objects in this category, equipped with these attributes and arrows, the following holds: [Stuff]. Therefore, in all cases, [other stuff]). Learn induction, contradiction, infinite summation, and whatever else strikes your fancy. \n\nYes, the administrative decisions are capricious and inscrutable, the lectures have flaws, and the Piazza will be devoted to commiseration and scarce on productive advice. There are problems here. But with a little preparation, you'll be just fine. Very diffcult class. You will finally lost if you do not have previous CS background in such as automation and language theory. TA's grading is very tough, and the homework is tricky. I feel that TAs want to make your grade as low as possible. The mean of grade distribution is very low (like 10/16). Becareful! They give the some problem just the same as problems somewhere online. But, do not simply follow online solution's approach. Otherwise, they will charge you of plagiarism. To be on the safe side, you'd better to cite relevant references. The first half of this class is useless. From the survey, you may see postive opinions about this course, yet the course is neither fair nor fun. In first few days, people dropped a lot. I dropped, too, before mid-exam. Have to say the person who completes this class is great! The way this class is taught does not belong in a computer science department. It is being taught as a completely theoretical math course by an instructor who is a math phd. As a computer scientist you can expect pretty much every job interview to include algorithmic questions. This class will not prepare you at all for it. You spend most of the time figuring out how to encode Turing machines or theorizing about esoteric mathematical graph properties, both of very little use for computer scientists. The instructor really didn't do much throughout the entire class. His attitude is either you already know the material and you'll pass, or if you don't he can't really teach it to you. The lectures (prepared by another instructor) don't really give you the background needed to solve the homework or the exams as set by the current instructor. You mostly have to make up your own curriculum and hope that what you studied gives you the math background needed to barely pass this class. I don't recommend taking this class until they change the current instructor or he changes the way it's taught. When half the class drops by the withdrawal date and the remaining half gets a C or lower, you're really not teaching anything and you actually didn't do your job as an instructor, in my opinion.  I'd agree with almost everything said. Hard class, worth it, you will learn a lot, demanding. I didn't (don't?) have a strong background in Math nor in theoretical computer science. Right now I'm hoping I can get the B. The only thing I would disagree is that professor was not involved, he was to a good extent responsive during piazza and he always held his office hours and spent a good amount of time answering any questions, it's up to you to come prepared to ask the right question. \nOverall I really enjoyed the class and I'm happy I took it. \nI wouldn't recommend to take it along other class unless you are really ready to sacrifice. I have a demanding full time job and family and had to wrestle time to put up here.  You will be on fire and in hell unless you have studied it before. But at the end, it is the most rewarding course of this program, for me. \n\nGrades statistics for spring 2017:\nA: 25%\nB: 60%\nC: 11%\nD: 1%\nF: 3%\n\nDon't know how many dropped before midterm, but might be a lot as before. I am not finished yet, but it is hard to put into words how awful an experience this class has been. I have never watched so many lectures from other schools in any course, because the gatech ones are so bad. There is little interaction between students because of the draconian plagiarism policy. No teaching. Just threats, dictates, and grades. I am riding it out mostly as an experiment and will not re-take it when I flunk. I am so glad this is not my first OMSCS class, because I would absolutely quit the program if it were. Treat this as a certification exam on your PhD level understanding of discrete math symbology and language, proofs (which many have not been bothered with since the 9th grade), and 1800 pages of at least 2 if not 5 incredibly dense textbooks. Know it up front, because you won't learn it from the class. A Computer Science class where you can't use a computer or calculator is just ironic and tragic. If you really want to learn this stuff you need to take this on-campus and choose your professor carefully. I see minimal value in the knowledge required to get an A in this class unless you are going into academia or just want to sit around with mathematicians and argue about P vs NP theory (I assure you the professional STEM world has better things to do). \n\nIt sounds like the course in Spring 2016 is MUCH different from previous semesters, so beware. In my opinion they are phoning it in now.  5 exams. 3 questions per exam. 5 points per question. 60 points between you and graduation. \n\nA: > 80%\nB: > 60%\nC: > 40%\nD: > 20%\n\nThese cutoffs utilize a \"strictly greater than\" policy. That is, to be awarded a B, one must average strictly greater than 3 points per problem. \n\nThere have been several changes since the previous time I took this course in Spring 2015:\n\n- Starts with algorithms instead of decidability/complexity. \n- New and better videos. \n- More active TAs with higher quality office hours. \n- No graded homework assignments. \n- More exams each with fewer questions. \n\nWhile there are no graded homework assignments, a problem set consisting of 5-8 questions is made available every week. Practice exams are also provided. \n\nThe exams themselves have matched the content and difficulty of the problem sets and practice exams, though one could argue the problem sets and practice exams are more challenging. This appears to be intentional. \n\nI'm glad to see the program is responding to student feedback, even if little by little. \n\nLastly, the topics covered in this course, especially in algorithms, are invaluable. While your day-to-day as a fill-in-the-blank may not require asymptotic analysis, amortized analysis, dynamic programming, or the like, the critical and analytical thinking skills that this course forces one to develop are well worth the pain. This is course is very challenging, but you will learn a tremendous amount about the various topics covered. This semester had the absolute best TA / Prof interaction in any OMS course. There were literally office hours every single day. I spent a lot of time working on this course (at least 20 hours per week), and I did have a CS undergrad for what it's worth (its almost 8 years old). \n\nThe grading scheme is 1/3 homework, 1/3 midterm and 1/3 final. The homework assignments are very challenging, and often times the mean score for an assignment was around 10-11 of 16. There were opportunities for extra credit to improve the homework score. A small minority of these problems are python programming assignments. This should not be your focus in preparation. \n\nThe questions on the midterms and final are easier than the homework, but they are timed and I was unable to attempt all problems on either test. This was very common among other students as well. The mean grades for the exams were in the 50s. The grades are all \"curved\" for lack of a better term to be normalized to a standard 10 point grade bracketing. \n\nYou will definitely want to prepare ahead of time for the course. Some things I wish I had studied prior (and other useful topics):\nMathematical Notation : Summation, Dot Product, etc\nSet Theory\nGraph Theory\nAsymptotic Runtime Analysis (Big-O notation)\nTime Complexity Classes\n\nI highly recommend you check out the lectures on the public Udacity site prior. While they won't necessarily prepare you for the assignments, if you can't understand the notation used in the lectures, you should review it until you do. \n\nOne thing I will mention regarding some of the other reviews: there is a very specific academic integrity guideline when it comes to using outside resources (not the lectures or prescribed textbooks). We had some significant issues with plagiarism concerns on one of the homeworks which led to some grades being lowered to 0. Just follow it to a T and you should have no problem using outside resources to help with the homework problems.  The course was very informative. At times the homework/exams felt more like guess work, but there was aggressive curving. I did not care for the initial reduction section. P and NP sections were very clear/interesting.  The class was both way too much and way too little. Way too much in that it covered over a dozen genious level concepts from the past few hundred years. Way too little in that the video would spend 5 minutes on something that you might spend 5 hours trying to understand. 'And here's the proof, blam!' Don't understand it... oh well. Don't take any other course with this one if you are working full time (big mistake on my part). While there was lots of interesting stuff, and I really did learn a lot, by the time it was done I was just glad it was over -- not a desirable educational outcome.  This class is not like any other class in the program (as of today). Most of the comments already here describe the experience well, so I'll concentrate on advice. \n1) Study the prereqs specified for the course, but don't expect for a moment that will get you by. Read the assigned textbook for the course (Sipser) and try, try, try to understand it before you attempt the course (yes, all of it). If you don't, you will not likely do well in this course. Use the Internet to help your understanding of the material (watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation video series). \n2) The teaching/videos in the class are terrible. Sadly, most of the stuff I found on the Internet presents the material in the exact same way. Your best bet? Find a group to work with to help you try and understand the material. And really try to understand it, because you will need to turn in homework that is based on your own thoughts. Additionally, your group will not be there to help you on the exams. \n3) Your grade is based on you and you alone. You will not get a good grade just because you did better than a certain percentage of the class. If that what you need to succeed, this class is not for you. \n4) Don't expect to ever know how you truly stand in the class. Grading (under the current grading style) is very vague and inconsistent. If the thought of this drives you crazy, stay far away. \n5) If you feel you are doing poorly in 1st half of the class, don't assume you will do better in the 2nd half. It is possible that you will. It is likely that you won't. Past [student] performance is no indication of your success [or failure]. \n6) Conversely to #5, feeling you are doing great in the 1st half is no indication of how you will do in the 2nd half. Persevere. \n7) Try out the class. It is a good experience. But don't be afraid to drop the class if you are doing poorly. There is no shame in not completing this class or switching to a specialization that doesn't require it.  This class is very hard. The prerequisites are reasonable but you probably haven't used them since you were last in college so you will probably be rusty. Make sure to prepare for this course in advance. You'll want to focus mostly on proof writing, make sure you understand how to prove direct, induction, and by contradiction. \n\nWhen taking the class, make sure to take time to work through the problem sets. The homework is harder than the exams, but you have two weeks for each assignment and have the ability to submit revised answers based on the homework feedback, so don't let the homework take too much time away from working through problem sets as they will help sharpen your intuition. Get the CLRS book, it's not really optional. \n\nThe lectures videos aren't that good, the videos Chris made for select problem set solutions were great and helped a lot before the exam. \n\nOverall it's a good class. Would be better with better videos. You probably won't be able to apply anything here, but I do feel like it will sharpen your mind and improve your problem solving skills. It's a lot of work so either take it alone or take it with an easier class.  I am like Josh Power above. I felt like I kept studying. Looking over the materials and watching the videos but I never felt like I learned much. When I did it felt like I kept maybe getting one thing only for five more questions to arrise. Be careful with this class and do not take it lightly. If you are REALLY good with theoretical Math, then take it with another class. Otherwise take alone.  Great class. Homework is generally short, but can take a deceptively long amount of time.  Do not take this as your first course if you have been away from college for 10+ years, raising a family, and working full time. The time commitment is overwhelming and trying to learn some of the topics and programming lanquages in the class are very very time consuming. I found it very difficult because I do not have a math background and since I have been out of school for so long found myself relearning the math concepts along with trying to learn the material. I should have dropped the class but tried to stick it out with no success. I will be taking it again sometime in the future. The instructor and TAs were great in the office sessions.  I have seen comments on other courses, and there seems to be a lot of courses that instructors do not pay enough attention to students' questions. Compared to those courses, this courses is very well managed and the instructor and TAs are very approachable (the instructor answered almost every question in piazza). I have a bachelor degree in CS and Math from a good CS school, but still I feel that this course is not easy for me, and each assignment consumed a lot of time. But I have to say the time is worth it and really make you evolve. I will recommend to take this course only or along with a light-weight course in one semester. I believe that if you manage to pass this course, other courses would be much easier for you.  Looks like this semester neither prof nor instructors are up to the task. Main emphasis is on not revealing the nature of the homework solutions (as people above wrote, there is usually some trick that solves it). Very often that results in lengthy 'around the bush' explanations, whch may lead student to the wrong ideas. Office hours mostly are review of the videos, and many of Charlies videos are very compressed 'fly overs'. But expecting TAs to 'spell it out' would be too much. So, office hours are not very helpful. \nProf and some TAs are 'sensitive' to the discourse among the students. So, when people expressed too many conserns with the course, professor responded with the warnings about plagiarizm in homeworks and actually lowered the grades of several students. That worked, and no one complained much sinse. \nPiazza messaging was very active, but mostly from those who were 'lost'. Those who could be helpful did not really try to help because they were afraid to break 'code of conduct' by giving too much help, and also because of the curve (if others fail, your grade goes up). Even though the material is very interesting and very useful, I would not recommend taking this class the way it is this semester, but most of us have no choice because it is part of the requirement.  By far the most difficult course I've taken in OMSCS. (I also took 6290 computing architecture, 7641 machine learning) Every homework set is challenging, the exams are no joke, compared to other OMSCS exams. You need to write a lot of things on paper and scan them then upload. Most of the course materials, homeworks and exams are about math reasoning. it is satisfying when problems are solved, but the process is challenging. The piazza discussion helped a LOT, I got hints to the homework problems(but still need a lot of effort and thinking) on piazza discussions. those discussions are really helpful, and helped the thinking process. I heard discussions are not allowed in later semesters though. You almost have to take this class as it fills in so many specialty tracks. This is a weeder class. The first time you watch the lectures it will seem like they are being taught in another language, unless you are one of the top students in the class. This is a class where students with strong math and theoretical computation backgrounds will shine. Most however, will have a very tough time, including myself. But fear not, the curve is very generous if you have the fortitude to stick it out. My advice for future students is to watch the lectures, but do not rely on them alone. You should get both BOOK s, do further research on the internet, do the supplimental exercises, participate in Piazza, go to office hours, join a study group, etc. But most importantly, just stick it out. It will be tough, but worth it. I feel like I learned a lot. Some of it was interesting, but some was just complicated. My hope is that they spruce up the lectures for future classes. Again, they were very hard to understand for the average student.  Great class if you are interested in algorithms and theoretical computer science. The first half of the class tries to answer what computers can do, and what they can do efficiently. The second half is about algorithm design, and how to reduce a problem to one you've already solved. Definitely a ton of work. Don't procrastinate! You definitely have to spend time thinking about the material, and rewatching lectures, to understand it. If you have a busy life, I would recommend taking this class alone unless you're already familiary with this material.  Lacking pedagogical strategy: The current \"instructor\" doesn't actually \"instruct\" or \"teach\" the course. He more or less establishes a standard (most consider it on the overzealous side of the spectrum) and grades accordingly. It is rather appalling to take a course where the instructor doesn't instruct, the lectures are given by a previous instructor and TA, but they aren't always on target with the course requirements and the level of rigor that is required, the instructors are somewhat responsive on the forum (the only clsas contact is via Piazza), office hours are explicitly NOT conducted, and NO outside resources or collaboration are allowed on homework! Basically, self-teach, but you're not even allowed differing perspectives to help really solidify what the student is supposed to learn. Sure, there are problem sets that are circulated that students are allowed to collaborate on and use outside resources for, but there really isn't much time to do those if focusing on the required homeworks first. Also, it's more miss than hit that the instructor will provide solutions to the practice problems to know if you're getting it or not. If you're up for a quite hefty challenge that definitely is a psychological one as well, go for it, but know it will be rough. It's fairly demoralizing, and I've taken undergrad algorithms, theory, discrete math and proofs within the past 7 years! There were some changes between this past fall and the present semester, but unless they make MAJOR changes to where this course is actually taught and supported, I'd recommend going with the II specialization unless you're determined to struggle for the specialization you really want. I understand it's a tough subject and students should expect a challenge, especially from an institution like GA Tech, but the department really should evaluate their strategy for this one. Also, check the instructor's reviews prior to the program... not very positive previously w/ other subjects! FYI: I dropped the class before the W date. Anyway I thought that this class took a significant amount of time and I always found myself questioning if I was doing the right thing in the end. I never felt like I grasped the material.  I hope math and formalism is your first language. I din't feel like the content was difficult, but translating and understanding the questions took a lot of time. The grading on the exams was tough, but the curve generous.  This is a challenging course. The material is very theoretical and tends towards proofs. There are a small number of python programming questions, but the programming component is minimal. Most of your time will be spent trying to understand the theory.  One of the very hard and very useful courses in OMSCS. For those with limited background in Maths or theoretical computer science, this subject might be more than a handful. But at the end you end up learning a lot. The course structure and the grading was bit vague, but heard that this was rectified in further semesters. Sad to see this course go, as a I learnt a whole lot here, though suffered as much for it as well. This class is extremely hard... I dropped it this semester so I can take it by itself. This one definitely takes some study time and hours invested to figure out the homework. I'm definitely looking forward to finishing this course... the material is really interesting.  If you like Math, this is a great class. The material will engage you, and the instructors are very good. The lessons move quickly, and assume some proficiency in Discrete Mathematics, and formal proofs. Additional reading and research will help fill in the gaps. Plenty of practice with problems is essential for exams. In summary, I enjoyed this class, even though it was very demanding.  It was a very challenging course yet I enjoyed it very much. I did some theoretical computer science research during my undergraduate study. Therefore I am quite familiar with the all the course materials yet still it's very challenging for me. \n\nThe first half of the course was about Turing Machine, Decidable, Recognisable and NP-complete, NP-hard. It requires very strong math proving skills. It's ok if you don't understand these concepts prior to the class. Nevertheless, you should be comfortable with reading the proof and checking if one proof is correct or not and writing proofs you know for sure is correct. If you don't know whether you can do these, try to prove quick-sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and is O(nlogn) in expectation. Try to prove that fibonacci series equation\nF_n = (a^n-(-a)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2 by mathematical induction. Also the HW0 is somewhat similar to these problems. If you are not comfortable with HW0, drop the course immediately. \n\nThorough out the first half of the course, you should find that most proving problems follow a pattern. For example, how to prove something is undecidable, you reduce it to HALT. how to prove something is decidable, you find a decider. How to prove something is NP-Complete, you first prove it's in NP by providing a verifier verifies the instance in polynomial time and second you reduce the problem to some known NP-Complete problem. As long as you follow the proving patterns, you are in the right direction. Google for solutions of the homework also helps but make sure you understand it and then close the webpage and write your own proof and cite the website in the homework. \n\nThe second half of the course focuses on solvable problems and polynomial time algorithms. While implementing the algorithm is mandatory in the homework, it still places most of the attention on proving the algorithm is correct and analysing the time complexity. Some basic graph concepts and algorithms like bfs, dfs and shortest path will help. Learning these algorithms doesn't mean you can implement the algorithm. Instead, it means you know how to prove the correctness of the algortihm (like what I said, you know for sure your proof is valid) and you know how to analysis the time complexity. \n\nThe homework is hard but try doing all homework including the bonus as much as possible. I particularly enjoy the moment when I solve the problem after 3 hours intensive thinking. Also, I personally think it's better to handwrite all the homework so that writing proof for middle exam and final exam won't be uncomfortable. I don't have much suggestions for the exams. Try doing your best. \n\nHope you all doing well on this course.  Theoretical class that gives a good overview of the most important algorithms. However it sometimes goes too far and we end up learning very unusefull things... \nIt was not hard for me as I have a mathematical background Strong background in mathematics is recommended. Get yourself familiar with Discrete math, Logic and Graph Theory. Lots of proofs. You need to invest a lot of time in problem solving, that is where this course takes all of your time. Even in programming assignments you are likely to be asked to prove correctness of your algorithm, and also provide its runtime complexity. So DO NOT take it easy.  It's an interesting course - learning curve is quite steep, especially as my first semester and back to school after 5+ years. The first half of the course is mostly theoritical and time-consuming, while the second half was quite easy but requires math. The lectures touch upon the concepts but for assignments and home works, there's a good amount of study required. Mere lectures wont be enough. Python was easy to pick up along the class. The best resource was Piazza forum - maximizes your understanding and lots of help. The homeworks are a great way to learn and mostly tailor along the recommended BOOK s - so that was quite a relief! Don't take the course lightly - it is demanding and start your homeworks early. There was always a homework every two weeks. And I found the exams tougher than regular assignments. Nonetheless, I loved the content of the course.  This class is very interesting. The TAs and Professor are quick to respond to questions and issues. All in all it was a great course, though very difficult. If you have a strong math background this class may be slightly easier for you. There's a lot of math notation.  Absolutely horrible course. Video lectures are completely useless for learning. Instructors have implemented a very poor teaching style. Practice problems with no solutions? What is the point of practicing without something to align yourself against? Your work is being sent off into a void. Vague homework feedback that mostly consists of \"you did the problem wrong\"? Yea, thanks. One TA grading something correct, another TA grading the same exact thing incorrect. Homeworks that consist of 3 problems that most people spend 20+ hours on... followed by exams that consist of 6 problems with only 3 hours? Right... The final exam had you calculating inverse matrices involving 1/12th fractions by hand? What is the point of that? And every single homework and exam problem demanded that you produce a solution in some exact particular format or way, yet you rarely have any glimpse into what that format or way should look like. I learned WAY more while enrolled in 6505 from simply watching video lecture material and reading PDF note packages from other non-OMSCS courses. I learned next to nothing from 6505 directly, and the entire course was an exercise in futile frustration. For comparison, I took ML... ML was a tough class, but doable if you invest the time. 6505 is something else entirely. Avoid this course at all costs. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this course is so bad too, because the material under consideration is vital to a thorough understanding of CS theory. The material in this course is what separates CS from code monkeys. This is why you're better off not taking this course, and obtaining that knowledge through other sources.  This class was very difficult though I also learned a lot.  This course is very challenging, however I think some people struggle with it more than others. If you have recently taken something similar to CCA in your undergrad then the material in this course is not that hard. If you have been a programmer professionally for years and forgotten most of your undergrad then this course will be extremely difficult. The grading in Spring of 2016 was also very opaque and led to some unnecessary challenges. My advice for this class would be:\n\n1. Take this class alone. I am a single guy with no family and I would not want to have taken any other classes with this one. If you have any family I would highly recommend you take this class by itself. \n2. Do not ignore the pre-reqs. Make sure you satisfy all of them before you come in. \n3. This class is very mathy and proof based so be ready for that. I personally really like math and think it has its place inside a Computer Science degree from a research institution, but if you're expecting to be programming a lot you may get caught off guard. \n4. Do not take this class alone, make sure you are on a chat group with other students or very active on Piazza. \n5. Use all of the additional text books, especially if Sipser's is the main text book. I really like Algorithms by Dasgupta\n\nThis course is required for almost all of the specializations right now so you basically have to take it, but do not take it lightly. This course was harder for me than taking two courses in previous semesters and I have a strong math background and took a similar course in my undergrad.  You are expected to have an advanced background in theoretical computer science, which obviously nobody has. There are 6 problem sets, which you can get regraded after feedback. So there are really 12 problem sets and 3 full length proctortrack exams. \n\nDo not take this class, unless you are alright with getting a C. The professor made about 3 one hour youtube videos to walk through some problems. Those were helpful, but besides that you are on your own. The current professor is not very helpful and seems like since he isn't the one in the udacity videos, he wanted the udacity videos to play a small role in the course. \n\nThis class needs to be redesigned to not use proofs, then people would learn a lot more. You can learn the concepts of turing machines, graph theory, and NP without having to work out proofs. Teaching the overall concepts of the different algorithms would have been much more beneficial.  The first half of the course is heavy on logic propositions, formal proofs, and mathematical syntax. If you haven't had formal logic in awhile it would be worth it to brush up. HW grading is pretty coarse; it seems like any mistake costs half credit for the whole question and they're inconsistent on what you're allowed to assume is 'well known' (hint: don't assume - write down a source for every theorem or identity you use). The second half of the course is more focused on programming; it is mostly in Python through the Udacity site, so brush up on Python syntax. Project Euler problems are similar to the kind of problems in the later homeworks.  This course is needlessly difficult in ways that impede learning outcomes. The Udacity lectures are simplistic and useless, although hilarious, since the presenter sounds like Elmer Fudd. The new Prof prioritized making this a weeder course. Valid solutions were not provided for prob sets, reason given was to have students work things out on their own. Side effect was that graded HW feedback could not be argued by students, as there was no ground truth to compare to. Much time was spent trying to \"prove\" things that had little to no practical real world value, (Cantor's diagonal argument). Difficulty defending any proof other than what TA's had in mind, or on answer sheet. Akin to religious argumentation. Prof mentioned struggling with 6505 himself when he took it recently. Seems this was payback time for the next batch of students. \n\nWarning, all online resources were banned. An ultimatum was issued halfway through the course for students to admit to having \"Googled\" to receive 0 on an assignment and have a note added to their permanent record to avoid more severe punishment. It seems several students had OSI investigations launched and received \"I\" incomplete or \"F\" on their transcripts. Imagine having this happen to you for looking something up on Wikipedia. \n\nUpdate: IRP stats are now up. http://www. irp. gatech. edu/reports/grades_by_instructorsmry. php. \nPryby - Spring2016 A:32, B:63, C:64, F:8, I:3, Total:170, (W:132) 44% failed\nBrubaker - Spring2015 A:38, B:15, C:9, D:11, U:1, Total:74, (W:107) 28% failed\nConsidering a C is not a passing grade for many specializations it is pretty severe that 44% of the non withdrawn students do not receive an acceptable grade.  The perfect combination of a challenging subject, insufficient materials, and a swap of ownership. It would simply be a tragedy if it was not required for almost every specialization. As it stands, this is the critical flaw in the whole OMSCS program. I would warn you, but, you have to take the class. Good luck.  Taking CCA is kind of like taking LSD. On the one hand it may expand your mind and you'll see connections and duality of many classes of problems, you'll spend time trying to fathom infinities that are greater than other infinities and create programs that consume themselves and result in contradictions. On the other hand you may experience extreme anxiety, delusions, dissociation, lack of sleep, and paranoia. You may have a bad trip. \n\nThat said this class is not really the monster it is made out to be. Complaints about it being too mathy or taught by a math professor are misguided. It is very mathy and you should accept that for a theoretical computer science course. For a graduate program you should also be prepared to write proofs and reason mathematically about the algorithms. \n\nTo stretch the analogy, going into CCA high on anxiety and fear will not help you out. Be prepared but not afraid. To prepare: watch the Harry Porter Theory of Computation series on YouTube while you read along with your copy of Sipser for the Computability part of the course. Watch the first 3 lectures from MIT OCW Math for Computer Science to warm you up on proofs. Start going through chapters of CLRS that match the complexity and algorithms part of the course. In particular pay attention to graph algorithms, dynamic programming and linear programming as they are a big part of the final algorithms section. Practice all the reductions you can for the complexity section. The format may change semester to semester, but here's a hint: if they give you practice problems - practice them - all of them - because the practice problems may show up on the exams. ;)\n\nLastly, don't delay the course. Maybe not make it your 1st course, but making it the last is not advised since that will just add to the stress of taking it. The best way to prepare for CCA is to take CCA. Good luck.  I took this course on Fall 2016 where the passing rate was much higher. The class was definitely time consuming but you will be able to get an A or B if you invest sufficient time. Here are some tips:\n- Get a good pencil and practice writing. We had 5 times exams. The exams were to be hand written, scanned and uploaded. There are some suggestions on the slack group. \n- Start working on the problem sets as early as you can. The problem sets were much harder than what showed up on the actual tests. \n- Make sure you are able to solve all the problem sets. Many times, the exam questions tended to be very similar to some of the problem set questions. \n- Don't feel bad if you are not able to solve the pre-requisite questions. I spent a lot of time preparing for the course, but was not able to solve most of the pre-requisite questions. However, I ended up doing quite well in the course. \n- 5 tests actually made it easier as each week, we just had to master 3 different topics. There was no cumulative final. \n- Join the slack group. You don't need to be active, but do keep an eye out on the discussions. You will learn a lot here. \n- Listen to all the office hours (good or bad). \n- There are lot of external resources which are much better than the Udacity videos. Check the slack group for links (e. g. Harry Porter's videos, MIT algo course, Stamford's Roughgarden's etc). You can go through the topics as they come up each week. Highly recommend against taking this course. The main issue is the way it is taught (and this is very deliberate by the professor Chris Pryby). \n\nThe videos, though interesting and fast-paced, do not actually teach. Take a look at Udacity to preview them. Worse yet, they do not help with the homework. \n\nI'm very interested in this material but ended up dropping the class as I don't believe it is being taught in a helpful manner. Though changes were made from Fall 2015, the changes are for the worse and only resulting in more of a time suck than anything else. \n\nThere is a Readiness Assessment that is provided after adding the class. It really needs to be posted on the official OMS site so that people have an idea about what this class will be like. \n\nYou need to handwrite and scan in your homework. \n\nVery poorly taught (or really not taught at all). Avoid the class. \nThis course cannot scale in its current form. Please fix it.  I found the time demand of the first half of the course (computability and complexity) to be a lot more than the second half (algorithms), but I suspect that is background-dependent. I had no background at all on the theory of computation or formal languages, but plenty on linear algebra, FFT, numerical approximation, and other applied math topics. The first half of the course is extremely theory-heavy and you need a strong understanding of set theory to do well. The curve is pretty generous. I ended up with a raw 85 on the midterm and that curved to a 100, so don't be discouraged if you aren't getting everything exactly correct. The main challenge is the logic-puzzle nature of the homework. Sometimes an answer will click pretty quickly and sometimes you'll stare at it for days and make no progress. Attend at least one office hours session each week and check in frequently on Piazza because both your peers and the TAs are a great resource here. There's always a little tip or trick that is obvious in retrospect to solve each problem.  A rich course. The instructor Chris Prypy cares about the students, which makes all the differences. \nThe best way to prepare the exams is to study the problem sets. I prepared for this course in Summer 2016 and took the course in Fall 2016. I was caught off-guard as the topics were rearranged, and the first lessons were not what I had prepared for. I am also not very good at exams (hate time pressure!), and the term I took it the grade depended solely on exams. So this class really tested my limits. I got intimidated and lost confidence early on. \n\nI planned to drop this class, and dropping deadline period then coincides with Exam 3. I thought I'd just give it one more push, study well and take Exam 3, then drop the course. Unfortunately (or fortunately?), I got too busy studying I did not notice the drop deadline has passed. :'( My grades for Exams 1 to 3 are really depressing, I thought I'd get a D. \n\nMy results for Exams 4 and 5 though are really good, almost looks like a different person took it. :p It was mainly because Exams 4 and 5 are within the scope I had prepared for during Summer, and that I did not attempt to answer the recovery questions giving me more time for the actual exam questions. That being said, yeah, preparations make a (huge!) difference. \n\nI am a slow problem solver and it really takes me sometime for some concepts to make sense, so if you are like me, prepare before you actually enroll. And while taking the class, solve as many problems as you can so you can gain speed for the exams. 30 minutes per question is really not enough for me. \n\nTo give you a little bit of hope, I ended with a B (yey!). very difficult.  Mandatory class. Important class, and I see the benefits i've reaped by learning this stuff in other classes. But while I was in it, all I could think of was why I didn't prep more, why I took it with another class, and if I would survive. If you do not have a discrete mathematics background, this class will be very challenging. \n\nHomework assignments take the full amount of time allocated to complete, and even that may not feel sufficient. \n\nThe rare programming assignments require Python/Numpy knowledge. The exams ended up with >50+ curves, which should be telling, since they are clearly too difficult or the teaching leading up to them is inadequate. Several changes were introduced this semester to address many of the concerns raised by students in previous semesters. \n\n- There were no graded homework assignments. Instead, there were problem sets which students were free to discuss on Piazza. \n\n- The absence of graded homework assignments was compensated by more exams. Instead of 2 exams, there were 5 exams! However, each exam covered only three weeks of material at a time, so it was manageable. \n\n- There were several supplementary YouTube videos that helped clarify concepts that were inadequately addressed in the Udacity lectures. \n\n- There were several office hours and, unlike in the past, these were available for viewing on YouTube at later times. \n\nIn my opinion the above changes were a big improvement over the previous formats and this was clearly manifested in the smaller withdrawal rate and improved overall grade distribution. The final grade distribution was:\n\nA \t101 32. 0% \nB\t115 \t36. 4% \nC\t10 \t3. 2% \nD\t3 \t0. 9% \nF\t0 \t0. 0% \nW\t87 \t27. 5% \n\nThis does not mean that the course has been compromised and watered down. Rather, by streamlining the content and redesigning the grading criteria, the learning process has become less burdensome and unnecessary restrictions and time sinks have been eliminated. The course content is still the same, so students still have to put in several hours of work. \n\nPersonally, for me, this course was a great learning experience. I took this course by itself so I was able to manage without too much stress. Since my undergrad was not in CS (I have a masters and PhD in Aerospace engineering), I prepared for this course by:\n\n1. Reading \"How to Prove it\" by Daniel J. Velleman. \n\n2. Watching the Harry Porter videos series (based on Sipser). \n\n3. Reading up on the basics of graph theory and related algorithms\n\nEventually, despite not having a math or CS undergrad, I was able to score 97. 33% at the end of 5 exams. So with the right kind of preparation, anyone do well in this course. This was my first attempt at 6505. I actually signed up for the new Graduate Algorithm course which did not start. I have passed with a B and feel proud of myself for having made it through. It was by far the toughest course among the 6 courses in my last 4 semesters. I would not say it was Maths heavy but it does require brushing up some basics and keeping them handy for proofs/calculations throughout the course. Prof. Pryby's youtube video lectures helped a lot during the initial part of the course. Video lectures on Udacity were dreadful. As the course progressed, I got a hang of things. Like others have stated, working on problem sets helped prepare for the exams. No matter how hard I prepared for all the 5 exams, I never felt confident before, after and during the exam, infact I always felt like I was going to fail. I somehow maintained 9s and 10s out of 15 throughout, which got me a B towards the end. It took me 4 tests to finally get a 5/5 on a question. I have to say that there were several moments where I felt like giving up, but I held on. I remember looking at the sample problem sets and exam questions before the course started; absolutely nothing made any sense. Just like everyone else, I too have learned a lot but at the same time I feel like there is so much I still don't know :) 50% of students got a C or less (and that's after many students withdrew following the midterm results). Of course each student is responsible for his/her own grade, but there's a problem if half the students are essentially failing the course. Expect a lot of outside study of the material. The lectures are barely useful. They gloss over the material and give no concrete examples that are on par with the homework. These are some of the shortest lectures of any OMSCS course I've taken (out of 6) and this is the hardest of any of the OMSCS courses by far. That's a problem. I also think the level of mastery expected by the professor is unreasonable in a single course. There should be a prerequisite for this course. The difficulty is just unreasonable for students that are new to the material. It sounds like earlier professors were more reasonable about this and graded accordingly. \n\nMy advice? Until they resolve this situation, skip this one and take the \"Interactive Intelligence\" specialization.  I was not impressed with the over all pedagogy of this class. Yes the material can be difficult to understand, but the majority of the hardship of this class stems from a severely lacking online education strategy. The lectures and assigned text are not adequate and need to be updated to reflect the heavier math and proof focus of the course. There is wide variation in the grading and a simple mistake followed by a completely correct proof can land you with a huge penalty. I decided to drop the course before the first exam because I wasn't getting enough out of the course to continue to go through the extremely draining process of keeping up with their pacing and assignments for another 10 weeks. Will get more learning the material at my own pace. Instructor interaction with students is good - best so far in the program, but still not adequate for the level of mastery they expect of students. Need more modeling and scaffolding. Not too much to expect in an intro grad course.  Fun class. Exams can be a bit tricky. Teaching staff was very involved and helpful. I learned a lot. (mid term review)... I've found this class challenging, but also very enlightening. Instructor/TAs are very active in piazza and feedback turn around is pretty prompt. The HW's and midterm were pretty tricky and can take a bit of work to even figure out what they're asking for. Once given a solution it can even sometimes be difficult to parse the solution, but I'm definitely getting better at it through the semester. I'm a little concerned that the grading may be even more strict than it has been in the past, but we'll see how that falls out in the end. I've been very pressed for time and wish I had more to be able to dig further into the material and get the full experience the course offers. I would not recommend pairing this with another class.  Very theoretical, mathematical material. I wish there was a similar course with a more practical emphasis, but I know the background understanding will be useful. \n I get the impression that the professor is more interested in making this a weeder course, than actually helping students be succesful. The learning curve is a cliff on every section of the course. The lectures gloss over the material and then the homework dives right in to extremely difficult esoteric problems (and the homeworks are graded very harshly). Just understanding the problem can take hours of research (but be careful not to violate the 'code of contact!') I think it's being presented in a way that's making it more difficult than necessary. You may find yourself considering the Interactive Intelligence track since it doesn't require a 'B' from this course.  I will recommend to have some understanding in graph theory before taking this class. Otherwise it is painful to learn the algorithm and graph theory at the same time. Python is a 'nice-to-have' skill so that you can have an edge in completing homework.  This class was very challenging, and also my first class in the OMSCS program. In the end, I found it to be very rewarding and I learned a lot that I am currently finding useful in my class this semester. \n\nIt took me some time to find the best strategy to learn and do well in this class, and here are some methods I found to be the most useful:\n\n* Following Piazza discussions about the problem sets\n* Using VisuAlgo to help me understand graph theory: https://visualgo. net\n* Reading outside resources (online) to get another perspective when I didn\u2019t understand something\n* Directly applying similar concepts/routines from the practice problems on the exams, rather than trying to solve the exam questions from scratch After a great intro into the OMSCS program with 6300 over Summer, I made the mistake of taking this class alongside 6310. If you are a working professional such as myself with a young family without a strong grasp in theory, I HIGHLY recommend that you take this class alone. After dropping 6310 a month into the semester, I found this class very enjoyable and the second half was much easier to me than the first. ProctorU is horrible and caused me to lose half of my final time allotment through computer freezes/crashes (and the final is 30% of the grade). I will stear clear of ProctorU courses after this. I was unhappy with the intructor's logic leaps in many places, this class is not for people without a whole lot of time and/or theoretical CS knowledge.  First, treat this as a 6-credit course because it's gonna take twice as much time as the average OMSCS course (some exception like ML and HPCA)\n\nSecond, unless you are super disciplined, it is not easy to prepare in advance. If you think you can, get the book \"theory of computation\" by sipser and read and re-read chapter 1-5, 7, 10 and make sure you can do the exercises at the end of each chapter. If you can do this on your own, then you won't have any surprise going into the class. \n\nThird, there isn't much hand holding from the instructors / TAs, they all have full time jobs and only instructing the class part time. Do not have high expectation coming in to the class, there is no spoon feeding. You are pretty much on your own with your fellow classmates and you should form offline/online study groups asap. Try to proactively organize discussion on piazza about the problem set and collaborate with your classmate and attack them as soon as possible. You might (policy can change) see those questions reappearing in the exams. \n\nA tip about getting most out of your study group, be very WELL prepared. Do not expect to discuss and learn on the fly, you'll fall behind and/or not understanding what is being discussed. Read all the material and understand the question in advance. \n\nPart 1 is the warmup of the course, if you're rusty with writing proof, here's your chance to practice, this is the least difficult part of the course, which will still kick your butt. \n\nLanguages & Countability\nTuring Machines\nChurch-Turing Thesis\nUniversality\nUndecidability\n\nPart 2 of the course starts with P and NP and ends with Approximation & Randomized Algorithms (they are harder to prove). \n\nP and NP\nNP - Completeness\nNPC Problems\nApproximation Algorithms\nRandomized Algorithms\n\nPart 3 of the course will kick your butt. Some people struggle with DP while others LP. \n\nDynamic Programming\nMaximum Flow\nBP Matching\nLinear Programming\nDuality\n\nExpect to work hard and spend a lot of time studying.  I am not a formal math person, and if you aren't either, then this is going to be rough Update: YOU CAN PASS THIS! There is quite a lot of negative going on in the reviews. You will spend way more time than you think in order to pass. You will be stressed out. But you will learn a ton of math. Just be ready to work a lot. No other courses, no large commitments. Good luck!\n\nI spent 20+ hours every week of the semester on this class. 8 hours in an online study group, the rest by myself working the homework problems or the problem set. I learned a lot about LaTeX. \n\nThis is a math course. It's probably better off without the python. But you also probably don't know enough about writing in Math yet, so this is really difficult. From set theory and countability of infinite sets to graph theory and vertex covers and maximum matchings. There is a lot of math. The programs you will discuss are programs that will always output the reverse of the program given as an input, or a program that when run will output a program that when run that will output.... (etc. ) There is a lot of Logic. \n\nThe professor and TAs are working to make the course delivery better. Ideas have already paid off and they have more. They know it's tough and a lot to learn. The real problem, though, is that it's really two 3 credit courses given in the time of one. So this course is about as fun as drinking from a firehose. And I didn't even want to learn this much math. SOME math, sure. But this is a ton. \n\nAdvice: Work all the problem set problems. A few of them showed up exactly from the problem set on the test. Others illustrate how to push boundaries of the section's ideas. Also read Sipser. Generally avoid the udacity lectures, which seem rushed and not very instructive.  Unlike some, I do not have a very favorable opinion of this class. I did learn quite a bit. But the bottom-line; the amount of time used was excessive compared to the value of the knowledge gained. So, a highly inefficient learning experience overall. I have a strong CS background. As an undergraduate, I received a 3. 97 GPA for my computer science work and have received an A in every other class in the OMSCS program that I have taken for a grade except for this one. In this class, I received a B. In fact, only 16% of the students in this class received an A, and as can be seen by looking at Course Critique (https://critique. gatech. edu/course. php?id=CS6505), the grade distribution with the current instructor is skewed in a direction generally unfavorable to students. So beware, if you choose to take this course, you are in for a huge amount of work and perhaps a significant amount of stress. In my opinion, it would be perfectly reasonable to choose your specialization such that you could avoid this class. Alas, at the moment that would mean that you specialize in Interactive Intelligence, although there might be other ways to dodge this class while specializing in Robotics or Machine Learning in the future if they expand their algorithms offerings. Anyway, in my opinion, this class isn't going to give you any deep insights about the world; but it will seriously mess up your schedule for the semester. It is a perfectly reasonable choice to choose your specialization specifically so you can avoid this class. \n\nThe current instructor, Chris Pryby, has a Ph. D. in mathematics, not in computer science. Not surprisingly, this class has a certain bias towards mathematics. I would say that the way that the class was administered in Fall of 2015 that it is about 80% math and only 20% computer science. Of course, if the instructor were to change, it is perfectly possible for this bias to change as well. To make the point: if you were to choose your undergraduate major based on your desire to complete this class, I would recommend that you major in math rather than computer science. Alas, since most of you have probably finished undergrad, this is a useless point as a practical matter but very important in terms of how you should prepare yourself for success in this class. What is important in this class is not so much your ability to implement any algorithm or concept, but instead to produce mathematical proofs that relate to them. \n\nAs a side note. The mathematics in this class is not particularly hard. I had a colleague at work who was a mathematics major before receiving his Ph. D. in bioinformatics assert that the level of mathematics in this course appeared to be at about an undergraduate level when he saw what I was doing as far as the homework. It is not the formal level of mathematics in this class that makes the course hard, it is the way that this mathematics is taught (or more accurately, really not taught in the class) that makes the course hard. Basically, for this class, you either know the mathematics (including proof techniques) already or you are going to have to teach yourself. I would personally put this up as one of my pet peeves about the course. (And full disclosure, I have several such pet peeves). The lectures are sort of computer science oriented and sometimes even interesting when Lance Fortnow was in the picture. But the homework is really all math. And the math in the homework is not anything that is covered in the lectures. So, if you are someone who likes to learn from lecture like I do, you will be at a disadvantage, because you are going to have to teach yourself any undergraduate-level math concepts you are missing from the Internet or from a textbook or whatever on your own. And you had better hope, based on previous experience, that how you setup the problem is sensible, because there will not be any feedback in terms of lecture about how to solve problems UNLESS you try to find a lecture recorded for some other class that covers the same topic, which can be a hit or miss endeavor. Anyway, as a practical matter for those reading this review, here is my advice. Don't watch the lecture and expect it to help you with the homework, the midterm, or the final all that much. Indeed, there is only a limited relationship between the lecture and the things that determine your grade. Instead of focusing too much on the lecture, I would recommend that you focus on the homework problems and consider the lecture but one resource that MIGHT sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the cs-themed math problems that are the bread and butter of this course. As often or not, an outside resource will be more valuable to you than the actual lecture. Do not be surprised by this. For example, at the beginning of the class, I would highly recommend a strong focus on the \"optional\" Sipser textbook in particular. (Oh, and don't be fooled by the syllabus. There is nothing \"optional\" about the recommended textbooks UNLESS you already own a textbook that is substantial similar. ) In fact, if you are taking CS 6505, why are you even reading this review? You should be reading Sipser. \n\nA note about office hours. In the Fall of 2015, there were two types of office hours. Office hours where lecture was watched together and office hours that covered the homework. As I was taking two classes, I personally did not have time to show up to many \"watch together\" type office hours. But the few I did go to were not all that useful. But don't get confused. If you find the \"watch together\" office hours less than useful, don't make the mistake of assuming (like I did early on), that the office hours are a waste of time. In fact, the office hours that go over the homework are pretty much must watch for most people. Indeed, if I were to take the class over again, the first thing I would do when I received the homework is review it and try to complete as much of it as possible before office hours covering that homework is held. Then you will be well-positioned to maximally benefit from office hours and just maybe, have something resembling a normal life. As others have mentioned, it is in office hours that many of the \"hints\" to the \"tricks\" that will otherwise end up consuming your entire life are given. Thus, being properly prepared for office hours is often the only efficient means of solving the homework and the way to steal back some free time from this time-sucking course. So, do not make the mistake I did, which is to insist on watching the lectures before attempting the homework. The lectures (which still are not optional) probably will not help you that much with the homework anyway. Just as often, it will be some third-party source of information that is key. I would also argue if you are a visual learner who likes to learn from seeing others work out problems, that Chris Pryby's office hours should not be skipped, since he has a tablet and works out problems. Other TAs often resort to typing out math in chat, which, in my opinion, barely works and is highly inefficient even when it does work. Oh, and if your schedule doesn't allow you to make it to office hours one week? At least in the Fall of 2015, too bad. Office hours are not recorded like they should be in order to give everyone the same access to the same information. People who have time in their schedule for office hours will have an information advantage over those who do not. (And this is especially critical, because while the lectures often aren't that helpful to solving the homework, midterm, or final, the office hours do cover that sort of information. ) \n\nAnother point. The title of the course Computation, Complexity, and Algorithms. Low and behold, other courses offered at Georgia Tech, but not yet to OMSCS students include Computational Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms. CCA includes all of these topics, albeit on a sort of superficial level. You would think that since all of these topics are covered, that the course would focus heavily on the interrelationships between them. But despite some noises in the lectures about such interconnections, that is far from the focus in the class. No or little knowledge of interconnections between these topics will help you in the homework, midterm, or final. Anyway, my experience in this class was essentially this. At just about the time I start feeling comfortable, maybe even competent, dealing with one area, it is time to move on to the next. So, don't expect to acquire an especially strong foundation or confidence in any of the topics above as a reward for taking this class (although you should have a reasonable introduction). Maybe the exception is computation, but for that, I would credit the excellent Sipser book, much more than this class. Also, the earlier lectures are much better than later lectures. \n\nAnyway, I am nearly done with my rant. As you might infer from the tone, I did not much like this class. My view is that it is too much work for too little return. Something to be endured, not enjoyed. If CCA were a stock, I would sell it short. But that said, if you take this class, you will learn a lot. It is just that you will have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in learning it. (I feel I would have benefitted more from self-study, where I would control the agenda. ) In terms of grading, you can expect low scores that are then generously curved. But in the end, as a practical matter, much of the class is nearly as much of a test of pre-existing knowledge and mathematical skills as anything else, especially when it comes to setting up problems or figuring out the cute \"tricks\" necessary to get to the end. (And it shouldn't have to be said, but knowing how to setup the problem is probably 50% of the challenge. So focus on that first. ) And while I have seen classes that grade on a curve being well-done, in this case, I believe the curve disguises the fact that the course designers do not have a particularly clear agenda regarding what skills and knowledge they actually expect students to acquire from the class. It is more of, lets test them on a bunch of stuff and see what sticks sort of thing. A curve can (in theory) be the most fair way to grade students; but it can also be a way of concealing flawed course design. In this particular case and for this particular class, I believe it is the latter not the former. \n\nNow, there is a particular sort of person that enjoys this class. And without exception, I believe that what sets those people apart is that they are very well-prepared in terms of mathematics and perhaps in terms of schedule (probably they are only taking one course). As I have said, neither the mathematics nor the insights in the course are all that hard, in retrospect. But what is hard is the amount of material you are expected to cover with inadequate time to cover it systematically and thoroughly due to the lack of a focused and clear learning agenda. For those who come into the course with very solid skills (such that they probably do not even need to take the course, really), then it is a pretty fun problem-solving experience. Maybe it even hits the sweet spot for optimal learning. For everyone else who is going to take this course, I do not believe that you will find this course to be anywhere close to enjoyable or a great use of your time relative to the reward. I certainly did not enjoy the class or feel that it is was a good use of my time. But then again, I am not a math major. Perhaps if I had been one, I would have enjoyed this course too.  This is a very difficult course, especially if you lack a Math background and/or are not familiar with the fundamentals of algorithms already. It's not an introductory course to really anything that's discussed. The homework is due every other weekend so I would usually watch lecture videos during the week and then spend the entire weekend doing the assignments. Tests are brutally hard. They're 3 hours long and, despite studying, I struggled on both and needed at least an additional hour (which is not available) to finish. The curve on the final was, I think, about 35% for reference. It's a great class and you'll learn a lot. The lectures often do not directly map to the homework assignments and require additional reading.  The first half of the course is a bit challegening, but not too bad. Homework and exams expect only basic understanding of the material.  I have loved this class. I always liked the theory classes in my undergrad because that IS the science in Computer Science. Understanding these topics makes you better in all aspects of CS, and I think most (if not all) of the other OMSCS classes that I have taken have touched on some of the topics here. As others have noted, the class does have 2 distinct parts. The first part is theoretical, and the second part dives into some pretty heavy topics with algorithm analysis. I actually found the first half of the class easier to understand just because of the shear volume of information in the second part. As far as time commitment, you have 8 assignments due roughly every 2 weeks, and each assignment took me ~10 hours or so. Add in time for going through the lectures and studying/preparing for the tests. Grading is very fair. I really like Charles as an instructor and a TA, and he is very involved and approachable. There are a lot of resources to help people in this class- the TAs held office hours at midnight Georgia time to be accomodating to people. Don't be too scared of this class, it really is very rewarding! The class does everything it advertises it will. The material is theroetical and well explained, covering Turing Machines, computability, P, NP, dynamic programming, max flow/min cut, and linear programming. The quizzes and tests are fair but challenging. Be aware that this will be a difficult class if you're not used to theory anymore.  You need to have previous experience on mathematical language, how to read and write proofs, discrete math. Trying to learn those skills while taking this course won't work at all. To be honest, the instructor clearly explains that, and gives a fair warning on the first week of class. Trying to do that would be like trying to learn Pre-Calculus and Calculus at the same time (as someone recently mentioned). \n\nThe instructor and TA seem very involved in improving the experience for all students. New for this semester: they returned a first submission of homework with feedback, and we had a resubmission opportunity for 100% of the grade (6 homework assignments - 3 problems each). Also new this semester: the course is now divided in three sections, for each one of them there's a proctored exam (closed book, one sheet of notes - two sided). So it was easier to study than for previous terms, when there were two exams. \n\nThe exam problems were very similar to the problem sets given for each unit. There were no \"official\" solutions for the ungraded problem sets, the philosophy of the instructor is that we should work on them on our own (but collaboration in study groups was encouraged - I know there were study groups on G+ Hangouts, Slack, and locally held meetings). Working on study groups really helped. An informal statistic for a group had: 11 A's, 10 B's, 6 C's. So that really makes a difference. \n\nIt was mentioned that there will be further enhancements to this course next term. Something else: do try to take advantage of every extra credit opportunity (if given). \n\nI definitely can say that I learned A LOT. There where weeks were I spent my weekdays after office 8pm-1am, and weekends all day long reading, working on homework, watching lectures from other universities. Take advantage of the instructor/TA's! Don't be afraid of asking any question about the material, I don't remember a question left unanswered.  Very theoretical course. Programming assingments in Python. 'Optional' text BOOK really isn't - you need to read the appropriate sections to get more of the nuance to answer some homework assignments. Instructors work well together and complement each other well. Due to scheduling issues/Google Hangout issues, I haven't been able to attend a single office hour, and material discussed there is very secretive -- possibly my only complaint about the course.  This class was one of the most challenging, yet rewarding classes I\u2019ve ever taken. I took an automata & complexity class in undergrad, but taking this class gave me a much greater appreciation for algorithms and the theory of computing. Despite its storied history and monstrous reputation, this class seems to have improved to the point of being one of the best classes in the program (I\u2019ve taken 9 so far), so it\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s being replaced \u2013 hopefully Graduate Algorithms will be just as successful as this has been the past couple of semesters. This class was divided into three sections: algorithms (9 weeks, 3 exams), computability (3 weeks, 1 exam), complexity (3 weeks, 1 exam)\n\nSome of the bad things were still there: the Udacity videos were largely useless; I dreaded having to watch these, and was thankful for the weeks that the instructor posted new videos on YouTube that aligned more with GA. I was also able to understand material much better by just reading Sipser and CLRS and watching MIT\u2019s OpenCourseware and UC Davis\u2019 equivalents of the material. Having problem sets assigned solely as preparation for the five exams (each worth 20%) was great. We could propose solutions on Piazza and have TA\u2019s or the instructor Chris Pryby (who were fantastic, btw) respond and give us hints and feedback. Tests were difficult, but fair, and there were opportunities to make up for some lost points on previous exams. No doubt the material is hard and might take some students a few semesters to get an A or B (particularly ones that have never seen the material before), but this is one class that I would recommend to anyone seeking a Master\u2019s degree in this program. Don't kid yourself or think that you're better than those who have gone before.... the average horror about this class is true, so don't take it unless you are well prepared (recently) and have sufficient time to work on it. For me, it was basically every waking/free moment I could carve out... staying engaged with fellow students on the topics to help test and further reinforce my understanding was key. Don't think that simply reading the text and watching the lecture will do it for you... treat everything like a project and don't stop until you've mastered everything inside and out. \n\nThe new structure introduced in Fall '16 did help: \n* The professor gave some good and pertinent lectures toward the beginning of the course\n* The professor and TAs offered some helpful office hours to help with understanding the problems (ask ?'s so you don't merely get a regurgitation of the text or the essence of the problem). \n* The professor allowed/encouraged communication with fellow students on the topics (working problem sets was key)\n* Outside resources were allowed for reference and to help build intuition when the lectures & text failed. \n* \"Re-take\" questions were often offered on exams to try to improve on previous scores. \n\nThis is a tough, but rewarding class in that you get to graduate if you are among the hard-working group that get's to pass it. I did on this second time through (prev' spring '16). There are skills that I have definitely used since taking the course and this should also help in coding interviews for future job searches!\n\nDon't underestimate any topic until AFTER the exam! Just think: bootcamp that never seems to end! Let me first state that my review isn't really fair since I had to spend more time with an even more difficult course, Big Data for Health Informatics. \n\nThis class taught me a lot. I ended up with a C, and I think it was just due toward the end of the class where I couldn't focus on it so much because I was spending all my time with my other life sucker of a class. \n\nThe material in this course is dense, rigorous, but it did seem regularized. The professor really wanted to clamp the students down to his style of learning. In a way, I enjoyed the \"isolation\" method that was suppose to bring about ones own ability to solve a problem. I think to some extent it worked. I felt like I was really using my brain, and I felt I was generally sharper in my daily life. These were the homework assignments. They were difficult, but we were given another chance to submit after they had been graded. I didn't do too bad on these, but honestly I spent too much time on them. I should have been focusing on the concepts as a whole which would have helped me on the tests which I never did too hot on. I spent forever on the HW assignment, and I never had time to do the challenge problems. I really had a time crunch, but like I said, I unknowingly set myself up for it by taking the big data class. \n\nThere could be something fundamental I was not getting, but over all, even if I liked it to some extent, this isolation method didn't seem like the best way to learn. I get it, that a degree in any establishment is given better credit when the students are not spoon fed answers. Yet, I felt like I did not have the proper tools to achieve an A. It's frustrating for sure, I don't know if I should take another semester and switch specializations or just try it again. I am a bit discouraged after it all. I did try to understand the material as I have done with my other classes. \n\nYeah, don't take this with any other high demanding course. Please don't.  This is the course that separates the wheat from the chaff. I have never taken a harder course. Part of that is related to the material, which is related to some of the hardest problems in computing. I get that. And the course will stretch your mind and make you really dive deeply into these issues, which is great. However... however... where to begin. Okay, the lectures are not very good. They do not allow you to argue for partial credit on problems. Normally it's either right or wrong. Get 7 out of 8 steps correct? That's going to be a zero. The fact that the course worked this way made me assume that they would eventually curve the grades and were doing this to force us to work super hard, but I was wrong. No curving. Grading is basically not on what you have learned or synthesized, but instead is based on perfection. On one of the early homework assignments I got a 4 out 16 because I wasn't understanding things. It took me 30-40 hours (sometimes as many as 50) hours per week for the rest of the semester to pull my grade up to a B by the end. In the end, I actually had a C but on the final I had answered a question correctly, but not the way he wanted me to and eventually he allowed that I had not only answered it correctly but has proved my answer and so he gave me full credit (I couldn't argue for partial credit) for the question and I got to a B. \n\nThe lectures need to be redone and I think they really need to think about how they have structured the course. Background: I majored in CS and Math as an undergrad. My undergrad work was heavily theory based. I can't imagine taking this course without that sort of background. I would heavily suggest self teaching some of the material beforehand. \n\nThere was a homework assigned each week, but not collected. Try your best on each problem and then look up the student answer on Piazza. This is probably the best approach to learning how to do these kind of problems. \n\nThere was an exam every 3 weeks (5 exams total) and these exams only covered the past three weeks of material plus we got a \"retry\" question from the previous exam. So each exam had one question for each week of material plus one optional retry question which covered a topic students did poorly on for the previous exam. I never did the retry question so that I could have more time to work on the required 3 problems for the exam. You have 2 hours for the exam, you also were allowed a one page handwritten note sheet for the exams. \n\nYou will need the famous CLRS textbook as well as the Intro to the Theory of Computation book by Sipser. Both books are pretty good. \n\nProfessor Pryby made some very helpful supplemental videos and office hours videos to go with the legacy Udacity videos from the previous course professor (I think his name was Charlie). \n\nOverall I prefer \"code slinging\" over theory, but this class was a good change of pace (6th OMSCS course for me). Yes, this course is hard, but it is just as rewarding. Remember the old adage - no pain, no gain! This course is very helpful in many ways, one of which is that the concepts covered here are used in pretty much every other course (and I've taken 2 others so far). At the end of the day, computer science is a lot about math - not just programming, and understanding the principles behind the programs we write is just as important. I was just as frustrated when taking the course - the countless times I've complained, the near nervous breakdowns and the constant frustration of not being able to solve the assignment problems on my own. However, it's been over a year since I took this course and I am still enjoying the fruits of it. Also, it doesn't matter if you get an A or a B on this course - what matters is how much you learn. To be honest grades don't really dictate success in life anyways. A few things to succeed in this course\n\n1. Be prepared - take some preparatory courses if this is the first time you are taking such a course. There are plenty on Coursera on Design of Algorithms. \n2. Set aside at-least 30 hours a week. If you are working and have a family, ensure that this is the only course you take that term. \n3. Struggle on the assignments - try as hard as you can on each of the problems. But don't be afraid to ask the TAs for hints and to Google for help (don't cheat, but ask for help and cite your references). \n4. The video lectures are not sufficient. Read the textbooks - especially ones recommended for each section. \n5. Solve as many problems as you can - Google for exam papers from other colleges.  Charlie Brubaker worked very hard to help out the students in this class. So far I have taken 5 courses. This was by all means the hardest class that I have taken, however it was also the most rewarding. There are many key areas that this course covers that are critical if you are doing \"computer science\", not just software engineering. What I mean by computer science is algorithms. If you want to work in some of the top companies, this is critical foundational knowledge. \n\nI get a little nervous when I see some of the comments in this thread. Georgia Tech is top program, and top programs should be hard. I hope the professors don't water down the program by making it easier.  This class is very difficult, but not artificially so. The instructors and TAs are available and willing to help. The material being covered, however, is inherently difficult. Be sure to brush up on your big-O analysis and linear algebra and feel comfortable with proofs. The instructor this semester is different from previous semesters and so far it appears that the class is even more difficult than before. You will not have your hand held and you will spend a lot of time on this class but you will hone your critical thinking skills and refresh much of your math background.  It's my favorite course, but it could've killed me in many ways. It's math-heavy and requires a lot of effort and tricks. \n\nYou should avoid it if you:\n- have other commitment and can't put in a lot of hours every week. \n- want to get a solid A easily by watching and memorizing the videos\n- need time to pick up writing math proofs\n\nIf you decide to take it, make sure you:\n- understand basic algorithms such as sorting, depth-first-search, breath-first-search etc\n- know some linear algebra and be comfortable with matrices\n\nLectures: be prepared to spend 20 min on a 5 min video. Either you watch it 3, 4 times to finally get it, or find a 20-min YouTube video that covers the same material but is easier to follow. In a way it's good because you'll end up learning so much. However it's very time consuming and there's a lot of responsibilities on the students. The recommended books are helpful too. \n\nHomework: the problems are interesting but tough. Most requires some tricks. Try your best to complete all. You effort will be rewarded on the exams. Start early. Twice I started the homework on Saturday and had to stay up until 3am on Monday. I don't know if they'll continue to offer extra credit for doing peer reviews, but if they do, don't skip them. Any extra credit will help with your grade. \n\nExams: spending 3 hours with difficult problems are just brutal. On both exams I spent a lot of time on the 1st question just because I was too nervous. I didn't finish all the questions, but at the end I accepted my fate and turned it in. Expect to feel depressed after the tests and expect to get bad scores. Don't be too sad though since there's a big curve afterwards. The grading on the exams is more generous than the homework. If you writing down any clue, as long as it's in the right direction, you'll get more scores than you expect. \n\nTo get an A: take every assignment and exam seriously. Try to stay above 75% on everything. Unlike previous semesters, only ~16% got an A this semester. To get a B: try to stay above the average every time.  Very theoretical course. The few programming assignments you do get are in Python. Most of the assignments are looking for proofs. Not a fun class, but the material was interesting enough and its just one of those necessary courses that everyone has to take (weeder course). Word of advice: Go to the office hours. That is where I did most of my learning. This course was one of the few courses where office hours is pretty much a necessity.  Very math heavy and theoretical class. First section touches on all sorts of big theoretical CS problems specifically reaching P vs NP. The algorithms portion of the course was very cool and gave some good techniques to a lot of problem subsets. This class gets into some proofs, but it isn't as math intensive as a graphics course might be. The weekly assignments really drill in the information and if you do well on them the rest of the course won't be too hard.  This course is hard. It's pushing me to my limit. I'm taking 2 other CS courses concurrently which is just barely manageable with a full-time effort. But I'm learning a ton. It's an incredible foundation for Theoretical Computer Science (really, CS as a whole). It's looking like I'll end up with a B, which is okay by me. The workload is highest during the first few weeks, then it slows to a more manageable pace as HWs are due every other week. Not having a strong background in Theory before this course, the HW assignments take me about 12-18 hours each and require some serious thought and effort. The lecture videos are great, but I wouldn't be passing without reading the text BOOK (also great) as well. Exams are fair\u2014difficulty of questions was on par with HW problems, maybe a bit easier\u2014but I didn't have time to finish. Was panicking before I got my (generously) curved grade back. Overall, really fantastic class. High quality course materials. Interesting subject matter. Highly applicable (I'm already seeing the concepts cropping up everywhere I look). Just don't underestimate the time and effort commitment.  I was quite familiar with the topics presented here, or at least I'd seen them before. This is math-heavy and I can see how if you're not accustomed to it, it would be very difficult. Lots of office hours, which is good, including watching the videos together. I'm not finding Piazza to be a good resource as far as getting student answers (maybe because it's a combination of knowing math and being able to explain things), so I usually just post privately, or if possible, use stackexchange instead. There are good resources all over the internet if you don't understand the lectures (sometimes they were confusing), and I recommend (these are Carnegie Mellon courses) material from 21-127, 15-251, 15-451. I'm sure there are other good materials or lectures available, too.  This is a very difficult class. I spent at least 30 hours a week on homework, and I have a CS/Math background. Some things I'd recommend before beginning the class:\n\n* Get familiar with mathematical notation. I spent lots of time early on just trying to figure out how to read and understand the assignments, let alone work through solutions. \n* Familiarize yourself with basic proof methods (induction, direct, contradiction). Luckily I had an old discrete math book from undergrad lying around that was very helpful in the beginning weeks of the course. It's also worth skimming over general topics in discrete math (and probably some from graph theory as well). \n\nI can't emphasize enough how little free time I had during this class. I had time to go to work, come back home and study/do homework for 3-4 hours, and then go to bed. I also spent most weekends working on homework. 16 weeks of this is draining--I can't imagine doing this with a family and/or other obligations. However, the work I put in definitely paid off. I was able to get over 100% as my homework average, which balanced out a mediocre performance on the final. I ended up with an A (barely). \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures for this class were very hit and miss for me. I really enjoyed the first half of the class, and thought the lectures did a better job of thoroughly explaining the concepts. The second half of the class was less enjoyable for me. The lectures seemed to assume a very strong background in linear algebra and didn't work through examples at some crucial points (thinking specifically of the linear programming lectures). I took linear algebra in undergrad and so that part wasn't so bad, but the lack of examples on things like the Simplex method really made things difficult. Don't try to breeze through the lectures. When watching, I would rewind a portion 3 or 4 times with pencil and paper in front of me. If I didn't understand a concept, I'd rewatch until I could write it out in my own words. This helped in the long run, but was excruciatingly slow. There were several times, especially during the second half of the semester, that consulting Google for lecture notes from other programs was beneficial. If you do this, make sure you cite your source if you're working on homework. \n\nHomework:\nFor me, the homework in this class was the most valuable part of the class. Dr. Pryby's assignments were extremely difficult (hours and hours of work), but they forced you to understand the concepts in the lectures, and stretched you to think deeply about the topics. The feeling you get when you figure out that key piece of insight is amazing. This is where you should really focus your efforts. It is possible to get > 100 as your homework average if you work hard enough, and this can help pick up crucial slack for the midterm and final. The only real complaint I have about the homework is that sometimes the solutions were not presented very well. I'd prefer to see solutions in as dumbed-down terms as possible so that the class can easily follow how a particular solution was derived. Go to as many office hours as you can--occasionally I didn't think I needed any help on a homework, but joined anyway and the TA would basically give you the answer, or give you an insight that made you change your answer for the better. \n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this review, it's to start the homework early. Being able to grind away at a proof over the course of 2 or 3 days is just not something you can pack into an hours long window (unless you're a math whiz). Give yourself enough time to really think about the problems. Write an answer out, then come back to it a few days later and see if it makes sense. \n\nTests:\nThe tests were extremely stressful. Unless you're a genius, you probably aren't going to finish all of the problems. You have 3 hours to complete 8 to 10 problems, some of which are formal proofs. That gives you 18 to 22 minutes on each problem. One strategy I adopted was to go through the entire test and work on problems that I immediately had insight on. It's not worth spending 30 minutes on a problem you just don't get, and then missing a problem that you might have been able to quickly grasp. The reality for me was that in a timed situation, I was either going to immediately have some insight into the problem, or I wasn't (and if I didn't get it immediately, spending 10-20 minutes on it was not likely to help). I felt absolutely terrible after both tests, but the average turned out to be in the 40s or 50s for each one, so as long as you meet or exceed the average, you should be fine. Another tip--the graders *want* to give you points. Write down _anything_, even if you know it's not totally right or if it seems silly. You never know--you might end up getting a fraction of a point. And for this class, every little bit helps. \n\nPart of the stress for me with the tests was the ProctorTrack system that was used. I was terrified that my internet connection would drop, someone would come in the room, or some other infraction would occur and I'd fail. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThis is only my second class, but the TAs all were very helpful, I thought. They were empathetic with students and were encouraging during office hours. They held frequent office hours and had \"watch together\" sessions. They were also very available on Piazza (at least compared to the other class I've taken). Dr. Pryby was also fairly active on Piazza. One feedback that I think most students had was that the office hours should be recorded. There was some pushback from the instructors on this, but maybe they'll change it in future semesters. \n\nAs for the grading--for a class involving writing proofs, I thought the grading was quite fair. If you think about it, any error in a proof makes the entire proof totally invalid. From this perspective, getting partial credit is generous. Show all of your work, and if you're not sure if you should include or explain something--just go ahead and do so. This should go without saying, but participate in as much extra credit as you possibly can. You need every point you can muster. \n\nBooks:\nJust go ahead and get both of them. At some points during the semester, I needed a combination of book + videos to understand the concepts. In many cases, the books were much clearer than the lectures. CLRS is probably worth having on your bookshelf anyway. \n\nConclusion:\nThis was a very rewarding class. I feel like the my knowledge of the foundations of computing is now very solid. At the same time it was extremely stressful. I wouldn't recommend taking it and expecting an A if you have other life commitments. Good luck! Prerequisite to succeed in this class are discrete math, mathematical proofs, automata, languages, basic knowledge of algorithms, data structures, linear algebra, set theory, and graph theory. \n\nIn some cases, it will be easier to read either the Sipser book, CLRS book, or look up other resources for the material. \n\nThe lectures and homework were created by an old professor. The exams are created by a new professor. The new professor is very math oriented. There is a disconnect between the old content and what the professor expects in the exams.  The 16 weeks over which I took CCA have been, without a doubt, the most miserable of my entire life. It's not so much that the course material is hard, but the material is so poorly taught (the lecture videos do not match the style and level of difficulty of the assignments and exams) and the marking scheme so sensitive to even the slightest error (one minor error in a problem can result in the loss of 1/3 of your validity points and two small errors can result in the loss of 2/3 of them) that getting a decent score on an assignment or exam is a constant struggle. Having now completed this course, I feel incredibly proud of myself, regardless of what my grade ultimately turns out to be. However, had I known just how awful this course was going to be four months ago, I would definitely have thought twice about signing up for it, and for the OMSCS program in general.  Great instructors, great response to student concerns, well-designed class. Everything about the class is great except the material! Super difficult and theory-heavy. I found I had a lot of trouble understanding the first half of the course until a few days before the midterm (which I ended up doing well on). Now I feel I don't understand the second half of the course at all, and there's about a week and a half until the final. Hoping it clicks soon. ", 
    "CS-6601": " Took this course as my 2nd in OMS after DVA. Looking back at the entire semester I feel this course really covers a lot of topics in the fields. Even though some of them are shallow, you do get deeper knowledge on the topics used for assignments, e.g. shortest path, A* search, decision trees/random forests, unsupervised learning (clustering), hidden markov model, etc. Some of them are must-knows for tech interviews. Also some very interesting topics like constraint satisfaction and logic planning, which could help you solve a lot of brain teasers:)\n\nI would say AI is about 2-3 times harder than DVA in terms of time spent, depending on your background. If you were like me, a professional developer in the industry for years, you will find it's easy to pick up python/numpy as part of your 1st assignment. But bayes networks, linear algebra and some other math really gave me hard time, so be prepared. \n\nThere're 6 programming assignments about each every 2 weeks, plus two exams each takes one week to finish. This made the schedule really tight and I didn't have too much down time during the semester even just taking this 1 course. So be prepared for a few busy weekends and stay-up-late nights if you work fulltime or/and have kids to take care of. \n\nOveral I loved this course and I think it was a great first course to AI before taking more ML related courses, as long as you're ready for the challenge. The course content was excellent. Most of the video lectures were great. The highlight of the course was the homework assignments, which gave a practical exercise in implementing AI concepts yourself; I wished there were at least 10 of them (there's only 6 in the class). \nOn the down side - the course pacing wasn't the best. The first half was great at going into depth at each subject, but the second half was definitely rushed, as if we were running out of time faster than the instructors had planned. I'd wished the pace had been quicker towards the beginning, so we'd have more time to look at interesting topics like logic, logic-based planning, and machine learning (though, I understand the last one's covered in another course) - perhaps ML could've been shorter or non-existent, and be deferred entirely to the actual ML course, so we'd have more time for other concepts? - The content is very interesting and we implement ourselves a lot of algorithms\n- Lots of problems with Bonnie and the automatic notation was not always fair. This is probably because the course was quite new at the time\n- The TA and teachers are there to answer your questions and were active\n- Some projects are a LOT of work... I spent weekends on it\n- The material is very well done but not very funny to watch even if they tried their best... \nOverall I learned a lot and even if it was hard and got frustrated often, I liked this class -\tExcellent introduction to AI. \n-\t6 assignments in total, I recommend to start each assignment as soon as you can, as they can be very time consuming. If you leave them for the weekend before its due, they will most likely suck up your entire weekend and you will be hitting your head against the wall for not starting early. \n-\t2 Take home exams, as with the assignments they require a lot of time. Difficulty is ok if you have a good understanding of the assignments and you are up to date with your readings. Take lots of notes as no internet usage is allowed except the notes you have an any links they have in them This was a great class touching on many topics in AI. The videos were fun (corny jokes - 'poor #4'), informative, and did a great job of introducing and reinforcing the concepts being taught. The assignments generally transitioned well from the lectures, but sometimes there was a gap. Usually, you could get most of the points [awarded] for an assignment from the lectures and class materials. To go all the way, you needed to do a bit more work [i. e. research]. All in all, very fair and quite straight forward. \n\nNo group projects required.  The beginning of the class was much harder (or at least more time consuming) than the second half.  There are 6 assignments, and you could easily put as much time into each of Assignments 1 and 2 as the other four combined.  The class is very interesting, challenging but not impossible, and very well organized.  There were some minor issues with miscommunications and disorganization, but the professor and TAs are very responsive and very reasonable about finding solutions.  Overall you will learn a lot in this class, but be prepared to put some work into it.   This class drove me absolutely insane.\n\nFirst: a huge chunk of the material on the exams were never taught through the lectures or the textbook. I took so much time to understand the lectures and readings. I look forward to seeing how much I know by taking exams in classes, but the exams made me feel like I was wasting my time. Almost every question requires the instructor to post a clarification on Piazza. Some of them even required a Wikipedia link in order to solve since it wasn't in the lectures or textbook. There is so much material to cover in this class, there should be no reason for adding material never taught.\n\nSecond: The assignments take a LONG time to complete. There are 6 of them every 2 weeks. You cannot catch your breath. As soon as you submit the previous assignment, the next one is released and back to work you go for hours upon hours. I do want to add that the assignments helped me learn the material the most.\n\nThird: The TAs take an extremely long time to respond to questions. This is horrible when you have less than two weeks to work on the assignments and you need a clarification.\n\nFourth: The lecture videos by professor Starner are awful and uninformative. The professor has two guest lecturers, Peter N and Sebastian T, and their lectures are way more informative and really good at explaining concepts. Professor Starner just reads from a script and is hard to listen to.\n\nI definitely would not take this class as my first AI class. I would take ML or other AI concepts first so that you know the material going in because when it comes to exams, you will not have been taught the material. This was definitely a challenging course, especially to be done during the summer semester. I had taken KBAI the summer before which had given me some good experience in Python and some Numpy. Given that KBAI was my first experience with Python and Numpy, I still did not have a ton of experience going into this class. AI really improved my knowledge of Numpy and pushed me to learn how to write faster code (vectorized) using Numpy. This was something I had never done until this class and was required to meet some of assignment run-time requirements. \n\nAll the projects were fun and interesting. This really helped me learn the topics thoroughly and dive deeper into each of the topics. What wound up working best for me was to just watch the videos, get good enough understanding of the current topic, then start the projects and read the book as needed. If I had more time I would have liked to read all the material but given that the summer class is shorter with the same amount of content covered in the class, and that I was travelling during some of the class I didn't have time to do everything. \n\nOne thing I really appreciated about this class is that it also had a Machine Learning section and project that has now piqued my interest in ML! Before taking this class I had no real exposure to ML and now I'll probably wind up taking the official ML class. \n\nGrading feedback could have been a lot better / faster. There was a grading fiasco at the end of the class where a lot of students, myself included, had the wrong grade submitted to the transcript. The TAs were helpful in sorting out issues like this but it seemed like this problem should have just been avoided to begin with. I am struggling to write this review. I was genuinely excited to take this class, having heard that a lot of people loved it. Now that it is over I have mixed feelings. Here are some thoughts:\n\n1) This course really should be split into 2 courses. There is just so much material that the semester feels way too rushed. I didn't get to fully process each assignment because it was due within two weeks, and then another (really big) assignment was assigned right away. The midterm and final were used to 'teach' us concepts that the assignments and lectures didn't go into any depth on. Having more time would allow for interesting programming assignments on topics such as neural nets, constraint satisfaction problems, etc. It would also allow for the midterm and final to focus on topics that have been fully taught. I have no idea the mechanics of splitting a course up, but I hope the idea is considered for the sake of future students. \n\n2) The midterm and final were rough. They were long (each took me 15-20 hours and I could have spent longer) and each one had some topics that were literally just a mention in the lectures. The student had to research and learn on their own how to solve problems and use certain equations. In addition, the questions themselves were not well vetted. Most questions required multiple clarifications during exam week, which required that you go back and redo questions you thought were done (to make sure your interpretation matched the clarification). The exam questions were excellent for homework problems, but on a high-stakes exam it was not a good experience. \n\n3) The curve is generous, so if your grade is low you still have hope of at least a B. Don't be intimidated by the 100% median on assignments.\n\n4) You get to drop one of the six assignments. This is critical considering how fast the class moves.\n\n5) Do NOT take as a first course. I recommend it be the middle or end of your course progression. I took it halfway through after ML4T, which was great because the Python/numpy came in very handy.\n\n6) Carve out time for this class. I do not recommend pairing it with another course, and find ways to set aside at least 20 hours a week. \n\n7) As far as prep, reviewing Bayes/basic probability and having solid Python skills will help.\n\nOverall I learned SO much from this class. The material was super interesting. I just wish the exams were done differently and the material could be more spread out.  The instructors are ignorant and super unhelpful. You can wait up to a week and still won't get your question answered. You do all work by yourself, not worth the money at all, better to take open courses elsewhere if - will get the same level of knowledge and help but for free. TL;DR: You must be a very good with Python before taking. Assignments are vague and seem hastily prepared. Instructors and TAs good. Most problems probably due to first time offering\n\nIt's best to think of these class as seminar where the lectures are really only a cursory review of the material but you are then expected to do independent research to implement the assignments. (One assignment involving MCMC is covered in the lecture for only 90 seconds). Unlike many classes where the starter code provides a lot of the minutia functionality, this class you pretty much build from the ground up. The starter code when provided is sparsely documented and seems hastily prepared. Got the impression that each TA was assigned the task of creating one homework for the class, but then those assignments weren't tested or validated by the other TAs/Instructor prior to launch. In many of the other classes, (like Intro to CV or KBAI) the assignments, while hard, show polish from having been refined over the years rather than being rushed to meet production deadline. \n\nThe biggest problem though is that after an assignment, there's no follow up by staff as to what the right approach or solution might have been. Didn't get it solved? Too bad. Students aren't allowed to share solutions or general approaches after the fact either. Makes it hard to learn if you struggle with an assignment but then get no feedback other than a grade. There was discussion of this being due to Piazza. Hopefully on future iterations the TAs/Staff will figure out how to lock it down so that they don't have to worry about future students finding the previous class forums. \n\nApparently the curve is generous, so supposedly everybody will be getting Bs or As. I was getting a high A when I dropped. I dropped because of the lack of feedback. \n\nI'm optimistic that future iterations will work a lot of the 'first-time-offered' bugs out.  As other reviewers commented, there are lots of bugs and erratas in Fall 2016's assignments and exams. I think with the feedback they got, this will be improved for the next iteration. \n\nThe lectures don't really go into details some of the times, you need to read AI a modern approach 3rd edition. The book is a bit dry to read. Also there are extra readings for the challenge / extra credit part of the assignments which are not covered in the lectures. \n\nFor the logistic/execution this class falls short, 3 stars. \n\nAI covers a lot of interesting topics. They are all very useful techniques to learn. \n\n1. Game Playing\n2. Search\n3. Simulated Annealing\n4. Constraint Satisfaction\n5. Probability\n6. Bayes Nets\n7. Machine Learning\n8. Pattern Recognition through Time\n9. Logic and Planning\n10. Planning under Uncertainty\n\nSo for the subject matters, this course gets a 5 from me. \n\nI wish they would tune the assignments so you don't have to do the superficial boring stuffs (each assignment has 50-60% easy points that you can get by doing the minimal) and add more (shorter) assignments to cover the topics omitted. The assignment and feedback are big part of the learning for me. \n\nOverall I'd give this course a 3. 5 - 4 stars I enjoyed this class - but it has a number of issues.  \n\nPros: I preferred the lectures taught by the professor (vs the ones taught by the guest lecturers).  They kept my interest.  I also thought the projects were sorta fun and helped ingrain what we were learning in lecture.\n\nCons: TAs really slow and/or unhelpful.  The projects could be a breeze if your mental model matched that of the TA that wrote the grader.  But if your implementation runs afoul of the grader (even if it works locally and passes tests), get ready for many hours of hair-pulling trying to figure-out the inner workings of the black box that is the grader.  The tests also bugged me.  They were \"fun\" in the sense that there was some humor to them, but they're basically word problems that include a small amount of AI concepts and a lot of high-stakes arithmetic.  You're literally building spreadsheets and/or writing code to solve problems and if your answer isn't accurate to within the sixth decimal, you get zero points.  Quite tedious if you ask me. Amazing course!  I wish I could go back and take it again.  The assignments take you on a journey through AI.  The first assignment was really tough, but it kind of set the tone for the course and compared to that first assignment the rest didn't seem as bad.  The midterm and final are take home and a great learning opportunity, provided you have enough time to do them.  Make sure you read through the prereqs on the OMSCS site, most of the \"I wish I had learned this before the class started\" complaints I heard were almost verbatim from the prereq list on OMSCS.  Thanks to the TA's and Prof Starner for a great course! Definitely belongs where it is among the top 5 hardest OMSCS classes. The material covered is good but 95% of the learning must be done outside the class to complete the assignments. The assignment/projects are long (~15 hours/week for elite programmers, ~40 for average programmers), cover key AI topics that are often hidden behind black box python packages, and are heavily structured. This is both good and bad as the assignments act more like cookie cutter puzzles cut off of a completed project that you must fill in with your own pieces. Nothing is worse than trying to decipher someone else's code and figure out their intent. This is somewhat solved by an offline testing suite but it is often limited to the most basic things. The class definitely has the feeling of being more interested in making money than teaching students. It's a better class if you prefer independent learning and showing off your superior knowledge and skills to the professor.\n\nGrade Received: B It was not as hard as before. It seems that some assignments and videos were remade for this summer session. As a previous message said, if you have background in machine learning, you will already know a quarter of this course. The grading was friendly. In total, I like this course, because of interesting assignments and enthusiastic instructor. At least, it saves my GPA. I liked the class for intended content. I thought most of the projects were made intentionally time consuming without much support in the concepts themselves. Lectures were a little lacking in detail with a few exceptions. Many lecture quiz solutions were not explained at all. The course took more time than necessary to learn content because it was very much self taught regarding details. I was a little disappointed in the presentation and instruction in this course. Big high fives to the TAs for getting grading done quickly. I managed to stay sane at the end of this course. Although the concepts are really interesting. The course is extremely hard.  This course requires some pretty strong statistics , conditional probability theory , advanced math and python skills using vectorization with Numpy package. If you plan to take this , please ensure you are really confident about these per-requisites, else dont bother.\nI do NOT recommend this as a first course and also , take this alone in a semester, do not pair it with anything else in your life during the semester There is some good content in this class and I felt like I learned a decent amount about various areas of A. I., however the class in general feels unpolished in its current form and almost feels like a \"beta\" release. Most assignments and exams had multiple corrections made to them AFTER they were assigned, causing frustration as you are trying to work on something that is constantly being altered. Lectures are inconsistent in quality/polish as well as how much material they cover and how well. Some lectures seem to be re-used Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun videos that are nearly unwatchable and not remotely on par with other OMSCS classes. \n\nThere are definitely some bright spots in the course and I could see this being a strong offering later on if they refine/replace a lot of the older and poorly quality controlled content. Assignments were relevant to the course material and did a good job pushing you to learn the material thoroughly. Some assignments even had auto-graders which I appreciated because you could roughly know your grade on the assignment before the submission deadline. To their credit, the TAs were also fairly responsive and willing to admit and correct unclear areas of assignments and exams almost to a fault. \n\nOverall I would still recommend this course as a good first A. I. course, however keep it mind it still has some growing pains and isn't a great representative of the OMSCS program as a whole. Most of the difficulty is probably related to the fact that this is the first run of the course but the projects are VERY time consuming. The videos and text book are excellent.  Great course: lots of fun and you learn a LOT (broad survey course). The projects can be a bit tough, so start on they as soon as possible! All of the material (lectures, book) is straightforward and practical, which makes the course very accessible.  I really like this class but it was super difficult and I don't think it's suited well for a summer semester. \n\nThing that will make this class easier:\n* Experience with python\n* Extensive experience with numpy\n* Previous experience with machine learning\n* Recent experience with college level mathematics\n\nIf you have none of these this class will be extremely difficult. Personally I only had the python experience, and I haven't taken higher level math classes in nearly a decade. This class was a giant source of anxiety and a massive timesync for my entire summer, and somehow I scraped by with an A. \n\nVery interesting material, but don't take it in the short summer semester. This was the only course I was taking for the semester as I was expecting a newborn. Bad choice. I withdrew mid assignment 2. I was thinking this course would be on par with KBAI in terms of difficulty and workload. I have completed 5 other courses in the program (KBAI, AI for Robotics, Intro to Health Informatics, Computer Networks and Educational Technology) and this one was by far the most time consuming. The material itself is fascinating and I look forward to taking this course again when I don't have a newborn. If you are strapped for time, or think you might be, avoid this course until you are certain you will have time to devote to it.  Best class I've taken so far (out of 4). 10/10 would recommend.\n\nTopics are super interesting and important. The assignments are time-consuming but fun and enjoyable overall. Best thing is you can know your score as you submit as the class uses an auto-grading system.\n\nExams are hard! They are 40-50 pages long and with a mix of types of questions (MCQ, short answers, fill in blanks, etc). They cover all topics in great details so you'll know you'll have to know the materials well to do well in this class. Personally, I love this because it forces me to think deeper and learn more from the materials. Very good course. Worth to take. Thanks for the lectures and TAs! tl;dr : 6 VERY difficult projects, one every 2 weeks. Advanced Python recommended. \n\nThis class requires a really good knowledge of Python to do just well in the class. Very little of guideline on the projects, you need to do a lot ( I mean a lot ) external research to be able to figure out what going on. There are 6 projects in total ( will drop the lowest one ). A project is normally divided into smaller parts : Warm-ups and Exercises. ( Warm-ups is a misleading term since it will take you more than 50% of the time and around 50% of the grade too) \n\n(This review was written half-way through the very first semester , however a lot of people already get exhausted after Assignment 2 ) Go into this class with good probability and python skills. It also helps to take an undergrad level AI class, but is not strictly required. I went in with poor probability skills and no AI undergrad class, so I've been spending a lot of time on each project. It is a very hard class, but the grading is generous this semester (perhaps because it's the first offering). It's super gratifying, though, if you have the time. The professor is taking David Joyner as a model for how to run an OMSCS class. He has been very active on Piazza, and the TAs are all excellent. The head TA is above and beyond awesome, and appears in the lectures as well. I'm glad I took it this semester, as I might have been scared away by the time commitment. It's worth it.  Decent course and I learned a considerable amount. I really did not like that some of the assignments' starter code was difficult to understand and sometimes TAs would have to go back and fix bugs after the assignment was released. I spent more time than I should have trying to figure out how the starter code was set up (bad documentation). This got better as the course progressed so I think the TAs were taking our feedback into account and pushing more polished assignments. The assignment medians are also very high. 98 or 99 in many cases. You have to get perfect score on almost everything and hope that some others do not, in order to get an A in this class. This is a survey course in AI and a great one! It covers a lots of AI materials that can be used in other computing disciplines as well. The assignments are hard but lots of fun, just completing those is an accomplishments I think. Exams are open book and I have found it easier than assignments in comparison. Grading is curved and fair. Teacher and TA's are one of the best in the programs. The lectures could be improved to cover more materials required to complete the assignments as well as super important in any AI course (for example, Markov Chain); I have spent considerable amount of time learning concepts from outside source (online academic source, somewhat ironically) to complete assignments. This truly feels like a GT graduate level course where the expectation from students is a bit high. After completing this course I think I can better understand the AI zeitgeist and actually comprehend the technical discussion around AI.  Similar to what a number of other posts have covered. But I would like to comment particularly on the use of Bonnie grading vs. unit tests. In numerous cases, the unit tests provided in the assignment passed only then to find that the same code failed on Bonnie. \n\nSo if you assumed you were good because supplied unit tests passed that would be a dangerous assumption, especially as you get toward the assignment submit date. What then makes matters worse is that when Bonnie fails a test the feedback is virtually useless in terms of knowing what is wrong. This is not to say that students should write additional unit tests - what I'm saying is that the unit tests provided in the assignment were dangerous in that they generated a false sense of confidence. \n\nSo overall a course that covers a lot of interesting content but as others have said there was too many topics covered in the course and it could be split into smaller courses. This would provide the ability for students to learn the material more thoroughly. \n\nThe TA support was mediocre. I realize that TA's have their own projects which take their time but when a student takes time to ask a well thought out question, replies from TA's like 'yes' and 'no' don't really cut it. That is if the overriding goal of OMSCS is to spread learning and knowledge about all these new topics.\n\n\n One of the best classes I've taken so far! The projects were interesting and helped me understand a certain topic very well. The exams were hard but thorough and covered a lot of topics. I really liked the pace of the class and the lectures and textbook were both very good. Very interesting but challenging class. Lots of work. The instructions for the assignments can be a bit vague at times... but you end up learning quite a bit of material from them. \n\nThe Professor and TAs are truly excellent.  Wow, what a first class to begin the program with!  There was so much work to be done, and with a full-time job, it was pretty crazy getting the time to do everything.  However, even without an undergraduate degree in programming, I was able to power through the course and get a B.  It isn't impossible, but it isn't easy.  The ideas make sense, it's just putting them together that takes a while.  Also, having had no prior exposure to Bayesian statistics really hurt me.  If at all possible, I'd recommend you study that topic up pretty good before taking since it represents a major cornerstone of the course (and it isn't immediately intuitive).\nJust for those who don't know the difference between AI and Machine Learning (that was me!), Artificial Intelligence is not making computers that think for themselves.  It is much more focused on finding clever hacks to make a computer work faster and more efficiently to arrive at a difficult (to compute, but obvious to humans) answer.  I later realized what I wanted was more under the umbrella of machine learning or reinforcement learning, but alas!  It was still a good class even though it wasn't exactly what I wanted. This course is not for the faint of heart. But it is a very interesting and fun course. Focuses in general on breadth, you will get exposed to the entire AI space. And focuses on depth in the topics of the assignments. \nThe assignments are very hard and take lots of time, and require very good knowledge of Python. But very rewarding. \n2 take home exams that are also very hard. \nThe lectures are shallow though as they try to cover so much, you'll need to do the recommended readings otherwise you will struggle with the assignments and the exams. There is a good class hiding somewhere in the course materials, but it wasn't on display in Fall 16. Overall structure was 6 projects and two exams. The grading is a little wonky, because only your best 5 assignments count, and your final grade is based only on your overall standing at the end of the class. Anything over the overall course mean was an A, and the B cutoff was generously below the mean. \n\nThe lectures are a patchwork of old content from Thrun and Norvig and some new modules with Starner; production value is good, but the new content is often superficial, and it seems to be read from a script. (I'm not saying I could do better, but there are better lectures in the OMS program at this point). \n\nContrary to other posters, I found this class to be a constant frustration. The projects were error-laden, and the staff participation on Piazza was below-average; however, office hours and instructor participation in the class were much better than other classes. The projects were not particularly difficult (similar to RL or CV), but there was not a single graded exercise this semester (assignment or exam) that didn't contain obvious mistakes/errors. Sometimes the staff would acknowledge the issue and make a correction, and other times... not. \n\nIt was not beneficial to start the project early (because of the errors), but it also didn't always pay to start them too late because they would often make changes to the assignments after they were officially released. The autograder (i. e., \"Bonnie\") used to grade assignments would get overloaded the weekend that assignments were due and cause all kinds of reliability problems. I think the Bonnie servers are Udacity infrastructure shared by all GT classes that use the system, so large classes (6601 started with 400+ this term) and overlapping deadlines cause issues. \n\nGive it another couple semesters to work out the bugs before taking this one. One of the best courses out there. Loads of learning and very helpful connect. Having good idea about python and ml basics will help a lot. This is a pretty hardcore course with 6 projects (one project can be dropped, only 5 projects count towards grading). Projects are coding based, in python. One of the things I liked the most is Bonnie (autograder) for projects which will make life easier. There are two exams which are week long, open book and takes almost the entire week. The cutoff for grade is curved and for A it was nearly 90%. I'll give a different point of view from most reviews - this could be useful if your background is similar to mine: when I took the class I had already taken: CCA, CV, ML4T, ML, RL - so I had a solid knowledge of python, probability and statistics, and ML. \n\nWe had two weeks to complete most of the assignments. I managed to complete each of them in 3-5 days max (8-12 hours). Notice however I always started working around 5 days after each assignment was posted. In that way, I avoided wasting time with bugs or asking for clarifications on the instructions. It's a good idea to find that sweet spot: not too early, not too late. \n\nSome topics were review for me (Bayes Nets, Decision Trees, SA and EM from ML; HMMs, VI, PI, min-max from RL; Kalman filters from CV). But I got out a lot from the class regardless - for example I got to implement some algorithms which I \"stole\" when I took ML. The projects I enjoyed the most were the Game Playing Agent, and Tri-directional search. \n\nI liked the exams and their \"open book\" format, I think they successfully covered important material, and conducted me to learn and reinforce the theory. \n\nAs others have mentioned, there were some (sometimes many) kinks and bugs in assignments and exams, but instructors were fair with respect to that (we got an extension due to some unclear instruction for some assignment, and we also got free bonus points for a couple of ambiguous exam questions). \n\nI only wish I had taken this class before other classes like ML, RL, but I guess then it would have taken me like 1. 5x the time. However, a nice survey course and I enjoyed it a lot. This class is no joke. I had to rearrange my life to have enough time for assignments. You actually program the AI projects that you learn about in lectures. Note that my Python (and especially numpy) skills are at best average, although my statistics skills are good. Fellow students were very helpful on Piazza. Don't forget about Slack, too.\n\nAssignments: Some of the assignments require really strong math skills, most require a decent understanding of probability theory, and all require good Python scripting skills, including numpy.  There were 6 assignments in the Fall 2017 class; you get to drop the lowest grade. The assignments are auto-graded and you get multiple (from 5 to unlimited) attempts to submit the assignment and you know your grade for that assignment immediately. I really liked that. \nExams: take-home exams that take 10-20 hours to work through. Exams actually promote learning the material that wasn't part of the homework, so I liked that about them. Make sure to ask instructors any and all questions you might have. Don't try to get what the question is getting at, or you'll lose all the points for the question. \nGrading: The class is graded on a curve (median and above is A, one stdev below median is a B) but note that the median for most assignments was 100% (midterm and final were much lower, around 75%). For the online section, A ended up being about 87%, and a B was about 74% . Don't bypass extra credit questions if you have the time to complete them (some are very time consuming and others aren't). As the class progresses, you might not be able to complete an assignment, so extra credit on an assignment might be the difference between A and B, or even passing and failing. \n\nOverall, this was a great class, one of my favorites in the program, along with KBAI. If you actually have the prerequisites outlined, you'll spend much less time on it than I have and probably enjoy it.  This course requires a lot of commitment, the assignments require additional investigation and strong knowledge of Python plus Numpy and Scipy. \n\nPersonally I did not know a lot of Numpy starting the course and was forced to learned as the course progressed, had I known it beforehand the assignments would have been less complicated. \n\nThis is my first course on the program so I cannot compare with other courses in the program, but I had to dedicate a lot of time to this one. \n\nDefinitely get the recommended book... either buy it (you will not regret it as it is a great book) or get the online version. There is a lot of reading based on the book. \n\nThere had been a few bugs in videos and assignments, which I expect to be fixed in the next iterations of the course. \n\nEven with this small issues I have really enjoyed this course. This course is very rewarding, given that you put in the time and effort. I made the mistake of taking this along with one other class, but even then it only got a little overwhelming toward the end of the semester. Before this course I would recommend knowing a little bit of Python, and review your statistics -- probabilities, basic distributions, and Bayes' Rule are all very important throughout the course. \n\nThe one problem I had was with Bonnie, the homework grading system. It seemed like the system wasn't set up and tested well enough before the assignments began coming in, but this seems like more of a \"growing pain\" than an inherent problem. I took this is one of my first classes in this program. While I wasn't prepared for how difficult it was, I managed to do well. The tests and programming assignments are very difficult and will require a lot of time. You will need to know and use a good amount of math as well. The material was very interesting, and overall worth the difficulty. I've taken KBAI, AI for Robotics and ML (among others). I think these three combined will give you some solid understanding in AI/ML algorithms. A great difference from ML is that ML focuses more on bench-marking/ comparing different algorithms, but AI is the opposite, asks you to create algorithm from scratch. A lot of mysteries in ML for me are answered in this class. I tend to disagree with other people about the assignments though... I don't think they are that difficult if you some background in statistics, I finished many of the assignments in 2~3 days, I wouldn't say that's ideal though. \n\nOverall a really great course to survey many of the AI topics, sometimes it felt to me they are rushing through the topics. I do wish them to separate these into two-semester long course so we could go deeper in some of the topics or maybe open a follow-up advanced level course though. \n\nThe piazza is really active, almost too active that I could barely follow, but I guess that's always good.  Great course with interesting projects. The material is relevant and it covers a lot. I think that if I were to take this course I wouldn't do so unless I had studied a decent amount of the material ahead of time as you will be pressed with both knowing the material and demonstrating that knowledge in python. It could be overwhelming for some as you will be pressed for time. The only real negative in the course is Bonnie the autograder. Recommended Interesting subject and nice review of content in-terms of video lectures. Assignments are interesting and exams are ideal.  It is good survey course. I did not found assignment very time consuming but mainly because I have taken ML course before and I am proficient in python (pydata stack). I would recommend taking ML and getting a bit of python exposure in advance (you can do one of ML assignment in Python for that). I liked Thad's approach to designing assignment and exams, particularly the aspect that assignment start with topics covered in lectures but then gradually goes beyond so that you have to research more advanced topic. However, I found videos to be little less engaging compared to ML and can be improved.  I withdrew from this class after the first 5 weeks. The topic was interesting and the lectures were great. But no matter how many hours I spent on the assignments, I couldn't get everything to work correctly. Programming assignments like the ones in this class need to provide clear, timely feedback. I spent way too much time figuring out minor python bugs and not nearly enough time actually learning artificial intelligence.  Good survey of several types of algorithms and concepts used in AI such as game playing, graph search, Bayesian networks, Markov models, and some machine learning. I don't have a CS undergrad so I was probably slower than the average student in terms of figuring out the assignments. The class needs to get a little better organized in terms of the quizzes (provided to on campus students in class, online students via Piazza). The quizzes were very helpful as study aids for the exams, but when combined with the lectures, readings, and assignments I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the amount of material. I learned a lot though, so it was worth the effort. They use an autograder system called Bonnie. I like Bonnie because it gives students feedback on their progress, so when you send in your final submission you should know what score you're going to get. All code is written in Python. Like many others, I have mixed feelings about this class. This is a dense course that covers almost the entire AI book. It moves very fast with every two weeks. The first 2-3 projects being the hardest of the bunch.\n\nEvery week you are expected to read chapters out of the book. If you don't, boy are you in for a fun time with the midterm and final.\n\nMidterm and Final are take home exams and are given a week to complete them. I spent at least 20 hours on each one. If you work full time, expect your entire night and most of the weekend that week to be spent working on the exam.\nWhile I loathed the exams, I learned a lot from them. They cover all of the topics you read through, unfortunately you have to learn as you go. They release challenge questions throughout the semester that were previous exam questions. These _somewhat_ help, but are not really the full cigar in terms of adequately preparing you for the exam. If you kept up on the readings, you'll at least know where to look to find the relevant topic.\n\nDr. Starner is not very present in this class outside of the lectures. He hosted office hours before each exam and that was it. He rarely posted on Piazza. Some TAs were better than others, but they were overall okay.\n\nI don't recommend taking this class as your first course. Come in understanding python and numpy. A good understanding of probability will also help and will make Bayes Nets much easier. I spent a long time figuring it out but am still weak on Probability Theory. \n\nI also recommend _not_ pairing this course with any others. Each week is pretty demanding and you'll really want to spend time understanding the topics and not feeling rushed with the projects.\n\n\nAll in all I am walking away from this class with a much better, and deeper understanding of AI topics.  Videos and syllabus were the highest quality of any class in OMSCS. Assignment workload was double what I think it should have been and at some point you run out of time to truly understand the underlying material and just grind it out on the assignments. I'd suggest testing on the reading more and less on outright coding. Wow! This class is rough. It is written up as a survey class in AI but I'd say some of the work is probably harder than alot of specialized classes in specific subjects similar. I went in knowing little about AI and came out knowing a bunch of algorithms but not to much on how to put it all together.\n\nThe videos: well done and think it was smart to use others lectures when appropriate to explain concepts. Sometimes someone else explained it quite good, why reinvent the wheel and like this design in the lectures. However, especially when Thad was teaching, there were somewhat of a very light explanation of really complicated subject matter not well explained. Thad is clearly very intelligent and sometimes takes for granted the intelligence or former knowledge of his audience.\n\nThe book: You are expected to read this whole gargantuan book. It is dense and really really hard to follow. The algorithms given in book are in most cases better explained elsewhere, for example in the authors own videos. I learned multiple concepts better by watching videos elsewhere then I ever did this book. My eyes glazed over when I looked at it many times and found watching youtube videos on concepts way more productive.\n\nThe projects: Time consuming and difficult. All the projects came with unit test which many times did a horrible job of actually testing your code. This also led you in a false sense of security especially when Bonnie submissions were limited. Bonnie submissions on some projects were unlimited but limited on others. Also, the feedback from Bonnie was usually unhelpful. Many times you were being forced to write a complicated algorithm from scratch even though the algorithm existed elsewhere. You would write it and it would seem to work with the crappy unit test you had. However, Bonnie wouldn't like it and you would be stuck with WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG HERE? You would spin your wheels for hours and hours trying to find a bug with no idea what was wrong. Again, you are implementing an algorithm you didn't write and purely in math form that was really complicated. If your are unfamiliar with the math symbols, etc, it could get you. And so you would have 8 lines of code where there was a bug but sometimes you just couldn't figure it out. Now here is the other problem. For some reason there were a number of people who did really well on the projects. So, he grades based on median being an A and 1 stddev being a B. However, the median would most times end up being a 100%. So, good luck with that. Note, the median is done at the end of class so the test bring down the medians to a nicer range, but it can be quite frustrating to learn that your 95% or 90% on a project is a B. Dropping the last one is also done in the median calculation so it actually makes the standard deviation get smaller.\n\nThe test: Ridiculous. You are given a week and are take home. They are so much calculation and so easy to make a simple calculation error. The midterm took me around 40 hours and the final around 60 hours. I took three days off work for the final otherwise I wouldn't have been able to complete. It is really dumb too, cause it doesn't test ones ability to understand the concept but rather one's ability to do the math by hand. I ended up purchasing a scientific calculator as you have to have it to do the math. The other dumb thing is the test is open book but the internet is off limits. This means you can't use easier to follow explanations of an algorithm on spots like Wikipedia you had to use the confusing books explanations. This is another reason you had to use a calculator alot to do things like log10(x**(y/t)). And you would lose half credit for rounding incorrectly to the 6 decimal point. Test became about doing complicated calculations rather than understanding concepts and I found to be the most useless part of this class. Note, I got B's on the midterm and final median was 78.65% and 67.8%. \n\nThe TAs: Overall pretty helpful but many times refused to help on certain things I believe as ordered by the Prof. Also, no help during test and had a now work on weekend policy which was super annoying since everything was due on Sunday. Never seen that rule before.\n\nOverall, the class is educational but don't think I could carry it into a good understanding of how to use AI in the world. I wish there was less focus on the math and more on the ideas which is what I thought a survey class would do. Maybe I should have taken ML which is I think more about the ideas and what they mean. I spend way more hours on this class then in any other I have taken previously yet my grade doesn't reflect that. So, take the class but know what you are in for. Be prepared to make sure your job isn't going to have any overnight emergencies or anything. There were many who didn't struggle as much as I did so ymmv but and I did go in very green. However, I have gone into other classes green and didn't struggle like I did in this one.\n\n First of all, I don't think this AI course is a prerequisite to KBAI. I'm fairly certain you'll survive KBAI w/o taking CS6601. \n\nMany people on this site rated the difficulty as at least \"Hard\". Quite frankly for people like me who have ML background, this is probably an easy one. There was nothing I couldn't understand in the lectures. The cutoff of \"A\" grade is >=78% (Summer 2017). This means so long as you got a full mark (not quite hard to achieve) in every assignment (accounts for 60% in Summer 2017) and don't bomb the midterm or final (accounts for 20% each), you're good. \nThe lectures will get you intrigued about major AI topics, but certainly won't make you some AI juggernaut. What on earth is AI anyway?\nOccasionally, you need to write your own unit test for the assignments. The XYZ_test. py files they provide weren't perfect - let's put it this way. \nTAs are trying their best to be helpful with their delightful sense of humor. In most cases I waited for 24-48 hours before a TA addresses a question I posted on Piazza. There were complaints about absence of TAs, so I'd suggest them hold daily mentoring sessions instead of just 3 times a week for summer terms (perhaps less frequent for spring/fall since it's less intense). People got frustrated by unclear expressions in the assignments and exams. \nUnlike other courses I've taken, the instructor was almost absent on Slack or Piazza. I have no idea why - probably he was on summer vacation and handed everything to TAs... This is a great overview of AI. The lectures do a great job of presenting the material with quizzes to reenforce your understanding. A few of the sections use videos from the older intro to AI course but I think those will be updated. This was the first course I've taken that actually felt like a graduate level course. There is a lot of reading (almost the entire book) however the exams are open book/notes.  This first summer AI section was rough. Cramming a dense 16 week course into 12 weeks without omitting anything was ambitious. But then Dr. Starner was on sabbatical at Google all summer (working on Google Glass). So, our head instructor was one of Dr. Starner's Ph. D. students, and he hadn't been involved with an OMSCS course before. That led to some issues that I'd never experienced or heard of in other OMSCS courses. \n \nThe good news is that I learned a lot. The R&N textbook is good. There were 6 fun and instructive programming projects. Each had an autograder with a submission cap (e. g., 1/hr or 20 total). I averaged 20 hr/project and got to 100 on 5 of the 6 projects. On project 3 (Bayes Networks), I only got to 85 after 37 hours and 20 submissions. Thankfully, we got to drop our lowest project grade. \n \nThe videos were from three different people and had dramatically different quality. Thad Starner's videos were great - professional and easy to follow. Peter Norvig's videos were ok - made with home video but with good explanations. Sebastian Thrun's videos were terrible - made with home video and with awful explanations. Thrun's videos covered some of the hardest topics (e. g., Bayes Networks), so they were a big disappointment. \n \nThe midterm and final exams were take-home, and they were good learning tools. They made me dig into several areas deeper. Each exam required a lot of TA clarifications on Piazza, but the TAs graded the tests fairly trying to take all the clarifications into account. The TAs were cool about regrade requests too if you could justify why you needed one. \n \nI averaged 22 hours per week and had an A before the curve. My only prior Python use was in the CN course (CS 6250), so I didn't know Numpy. This course takes hard work, but I strongly recommend that you only take it during a full semester when Dr. Starner is available to manage the course. I finished less interested in AI & ML than when I started. As much as I learned in this course, I didn't enjoy it because it was just far too stressful and time consuming. Considering I took it in the summer, I highly recommend students save this course for the fall or spring, and take it as their only class. The main challenge in the assignments is that you can get stuck on one part for hours on end not getting anywhere, and that can continue to happen throughout the rest of the assignment! This was my first class in OMSCS and I thought it was fantastic.  It provided an overview of AI concepts and techniques that I found challenging and rewarding.  The TAs and professors were very engaged, responsive, and helpful.  I initially put in way more than 20 hours/week during the first assignment until I figured out how to get help from the TAs using Piazza.  Using Piazza and the student Slack channel made my life much easier.  The material was still very challenging but getting to the resources I needed to solve the problems was much more efficient. This course had 6 assignments in total. 1 midterm and 1 take home exam (for 1 week). I can tell every assignment was challenging and required a significant amount of effort to complete. In many of the assignment you will need to deal with some python subtleties like vectorizing your operations on images using numpy (this can take some time to grasp). This class also requires probabilities but some lectures are completed dedicated to introduce you to what you need. This class had very high quality and great professors like Thad Starner, Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun. The textbook is a great book. I learned a lot in this class. I hadn't taken any AI class before and still managed to get good grades but I had to put many hours. \n\nThe TAs and professor were very responsive.  I had all the prerequisites (not ML) and what should have been enough time but TBH couldn't hack it, and dropped at last moment. So I recommend watching all the lectures or reading all the material (chapters 1 - 21 except 16, 19, >20. 3) ahead of course. You'll definitely need to do both to get through, the first time that's been true for me in 9 OMSCS courses. \nOther problems: \nWhen I pointed out that the TAs cancel office hours without notice I got a promise that it won't happen again -- and 0. 00 TA behavioral modification, which still strikes me as bizarre. \nRan into a nasty bug that prevented assignment completion and dropping the course. We reported it, but TAs never followed up, so the bug hasn't been corrected in the source library. I'm trying to find time to create a minimal, non-HW example and report it myself. \nWithout a test for every aspect of an assignment that the server tests for, there is a real risk that you won't find every nonconformity from (sometimes nebulous) desiderata in your code. Students should get different tests that nevertheless cover every test /type/, but evidently the professor has a, IMHO, misplaced fear that we're already so good at AI we can evolve a general solution from the tests. Great course and very similar to my undergrad AI course. All assignments are graded via Bonnie (which I really liked) - instant feedback and easy to use. Exams were fair and open book. Overall great survey of the field and recommend!  This course was fabulously interesting. The assignments are well-designed to force you to implement some important algorithms. The exams were take-home and open-book, which allows you to use the exam as a way to learn additional material you would not have otherwise. (You'll notice other reviewers think this is a bad thing, but I think it's actually a positive that we get to learn things during the exam.) The pace of the six projects and two exams allow for no breathing.\n\nI mostly did not read the textbook and instead relied on the lectures. Many students complained the lectures were high-level, but I appreciated this since they focused on conceptual understanding. There are many online links to get more detailed information for completing assignments.\n\nI found the TA answers to questions mostly unhelpful. Everything you need to complete assignments ultimately comes up on Slack or Piazza though.\n\nI would highly recommend taking this class though I am glad I didn't pair it with another. Great class overall. I got behind and had to focus just on the HW instead of the readings/learning\n\nTAs were fair and quick a responding. NOTE the projects change somewhat frequently :/ Here's the thing about this class: the class is curved, so that's good. Less good is that the median for the homework is often a 100 or close to it. That is because you CAN reach a hundred, but for the first few assignments you have to work for 2 weeks straight and be smart. For the second half of the assignment, it can be done more easily by working 2 weeks straight without the smart part.\n\nYour fellow classmates will reach a 100 in the assignments and drive the median up, so that means you have to as well. Then, since everyone presumably got full credit for the homework, it means the grade is based on the two exams, which are RIDICULOUS. You think you're good reviewing the lectures and book? NOPE. In both exams, there was new information entirely! There were wikipedia links to start learning mathematical concepts MID EXAM. Even if it was briefly covered in the lecture/book, it will be there on the exam. If the lecturer says \"We won't get into this too much but here is a brief explanation\" - don't worry, the exam will get into it in depth! You will get a chance to learn that material mid exam, which last for a week. Yay. The assignments and exams are really well-designed. The format this semester is exactly the same as previous years. The professor does hold youtube live sessions for two midterm exams, which you don't often see in OMSCS. The exams are updated every year and you can actually tell it is constantly improving.\n\nIt is important to try your best to get the extra credits, some of them are actually easier than you think. I got most assignments full grades, plus 70% of the extra credit, but bombed two exams---both are >10 points lower than the median---yet I still got an A. It can be said that the extra credits saved my ass.\n\nContent-wise, the course is basically a survey of some basic AI and ML algorithms, you may actually have heard of implemented some of them in other classes, but still, it gives you an wholistic view of what's in your toolbox, and sometimes they framed it in a way that uses different algorithms to solve the same problem. So it's very useful for anyone who wants to work on AI/ML in the future. Along with ML this has been one of my favourite classes. The TAs and Professor are extremely helpful, the material is difficult, but not overwhelmingly so (there is some expectation that you will seek external resources or spend a lot of time reading the textbook, as lectures videos by themselves are probably too shallow to complete assignments). I felt the midsem was fair assessment of your knowledge. \n\nAs for the assignment, there is a level of satisfaction with \"getting to the end\". This doesn't mean that I'll score 100%, but merely finishing is an achievement in itself. Others in Piazza have noted that the marks gained in each segment of the assignments are not weighed with the amount of time used solving them - I believe this is correct and to be honest I'm totally fine with that. \n\nI think anyone taking this course will learn alot and is well worthwhile. \n\nTop tips:\n\n* Review AI topics beforehand (use google to find the syllabus)\n* Knowledge of Numpy/Python would help\n* Taking ML first would naturally make the ML portions easier... \n\nI don't think there's really any course that I would say should be done as a prerequisite for the AI course, and would work fine as a first course.  This course was very difficult, took a ton of time and was very stressful at times. That being said, I'd take another class like it in a heart-beat! Thad's level of interaction with the class on piazza and in the office hours really made you feel like he cared about your understanding.  This class was one of the most difficult classes I have taken in the program but found it to be one of the most rewarding. It covers a wide variety of topics in great depth so be prepared to put in the time. As others have mentioned, there are 6 assignments (highest 5 count towards your final grade) and 2 take-home exams. Do not underestimate the exams because they are take home - they are no joke. If you fall behind on the readings, the exams will take you some time. I think I spent around 60 hours on the midterm. I felt the exams were a great mechanism for learning the material however. Overall, this class was amazing and one of my favorites. I highly recommend this course! This was an excellent class, but incredibly hard class.  There is a ton of material that's covered and you're expected to know a lot by the end.  There are two exams and six assignments, but you only use your top five assignment scores.  With the pace of the class, you'll be constantly working on something.  By the end of the class I was completely burned out, but I felt like a learned a ton. This course was fun but I really didn't learn much other than how to try enough solutions to get an answer. The exams for this class are a complete joke because it's basically just the TAs getting together to figure out gotcha questions. Each exam question is an extreme deep dive into one of the many subjects this course covers then modifying one small feature of the subject and asking vague questions about it that you must infer a lot of what the TA was thinking when they wrote it. They also give you a week to complete the exam so there's no real studying for it and you should expect to spend 10-15 hours on it. The assignments are fun but don't relate to each other so you will learn a lot about the subject then completely erase your memory for the next subject. I enjoyed this class but the exams didn't really test anything other than how good you are at guessing. The professors doing the lectures are really smart though so the videos are pretty entertaining. Background: No prior experience with AI/ML but had a little idea about what things are\n\nI found the course very useful. The textbook used was \"Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach, 3rd edition\". The course covers almost the entire textbook. This is a great course that gives an overview of all AI/ML techniques. Even though it covers such a wide breadth of topics, the course does fair amount of justice to them. All the topics are covered in a depth that you can get a fairly good idea about the topics. The knowledge you will gain in this course will not be shallow as is usually feared from courses that have a very wide course. \n\nIn terms of difficulty, I found the course to be fairly difficult. That is also given the fact that I did not have prior AI/ML experience. The assignments make us code various AI/ML algos from scratch with helps in a deeper understanding. Assignments will take time if your situation is like I had. Assignments are in python and good understanding of numpy can help. \n\nExams are open book and pretty tough but fun nonetheless. \n\nTA interactions are great. In my time we had at least 2 great TAs who were always active on slack. You might find lectures a bit too shallow but textbook and additional readings make up for that. \n\nIMO this course is a must if you dont have a prior AI/ML experience and want to pursue ML specialization. Overall, this is a quick tour of AI topics. You'll cover game playing, search, machine learning, pattern recognition, and a few other topics. The assignments are intense but overall manageable if you start early and use the resources available (I found the slack community the most helpful followed by piazza). The exams are rough. This semester we were given a week to complete a take home exam for the midterm and final. The exams are more open-ended than the assignments and require a lot of time. I think a few things could help students prior to taking the class:\n\n1. Be comfortable with python and numpy\n2. Take a course or two covering related topics prior to this course (ML4T, AI4R, DVA, ML, etc)\n3. Start everything early and ask questions.\n4. Complete any extra credit you can\n\nI felt like this class was definitely worth it for those interested in ML/AI and is probably better earlier in the program. If you have the time and interest, I would recommend giving it a try! Awesome class. Some highlights:\n\n* Both very hard and and very time consuming\n* the lessons introduce the concepts, the reading fills in the gaps, and the projects and exams are where the reinforcement learning really takes place\n* Do ALL the reading. Try your best to do the readings and lessons before beginning the projects\n* Python experience -- if you don't have it, get some in advance. Anyone familiar with Java or C/C++ should be able to work comfortably in Python. If you have time, get familiar with numpy\n* Brush up on linear algebra, logarithmic math, and Big O notation\n\nTA's were very engaged. Professor Thad had a busy travel schedule this semester, but his passion for the topics came through in the office hours and times he participated on Piazza. \n\nTwo cons:\n\n* the projects come out as a \"work in progress/beta\" -- if you start early, prepare to be frustrated with moving targets, bugs, and changes along the way. If you wait until the \"official release\" expect many sleepless nights to finish the work on time\n\n* it was announced at the beginning that grading would be based on class median -- anyone above the median would get an A. This led to a significant amount of churn over grades in Piazza and Slack and a funny \"if I help you I might hurt myself\" dynamic which prevented collaborative learning. In the end, an overall grade of 69 and above was a B, 85+ an A. Grading was fair, students need to chill. I got my A by pure brute force, but I learned a lot in the process. This class is great because it's a lot of programming. I appreciated the exposure to Numpy. \n\nThis course would be best to take not as a first course, but it's high-level enough that I wouldn't push it off until the end either. \n\nDon't let the first assignment scare you away. I bombed it, but still did fine. \n\nI wish I had a better foundation in probability concepts before taking this course. I had to learn a lot along the way, and I still am uncertain about that area in particular. \n\nThe lectures were meh. The exams did a good job of convincing me that I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. The TAs did a great job.  I'll echo most of the other reviewers in saying that this is an exceedingly challenging course. The first two projects are significantly harder than the others so if you can make it through those you should be good for the remainder. I had taken ML4T and AI4R before this class and those two definitely helped me prepare for the python/numpy needed. At minimum, I would recommend taking ML4T before this.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the course is the exams. They would make excellent homework problems distributed throughout the semester instead of the ~50-page behemoths we were given. The problems were actually really great in terms of fostering learning outside of the projects, but that value greatly is diminished when you're on a 1-week deadline and are restricted in terms of the materials available to you. I did great on the midterm but by the time the final came around, I was already exhausted by the class and it clearly showed in my grade. I took this course during the during my second semester in the program along with CS 6035 IIS. My previous courses were CS 6250 CN and CS 6340 SAT. I had learned the basics of Python in CN but I had not used numpy at all before this course. Additionally, I completed a computer engineering undergraduate degree in 2014 as my only other exposure to computer science before this program. This information is all to compare to your own circumstances.\n\nOverall, this course was by far my favorite while also being the most difficult and most work thus far. Some projects took 10 hours while others took up to 50 hours due to my background. The projects are very diverse so if you've never seen some of these topics until this course, then your learning curve will be longer for each project like mine. The majority of the projects had extra credit that rewards those who know their coding and material. I highly recommend scoring as many points as possible on the projects as the midterm and finals are intense.\n\nBoth exams are take-home exams that are 35-45 pages each with a full week to complete. I spent 40-50 hours on them to achieve a level above the median to make up for my lackluster performance on a project. These exams will thoroughly test your knowledge of each part of the course, which I prefer as you can't fake your knowledge. You are only allowed the class resources and book for these exams. No INTERNET, collaboration and so forth is allowed. The book is a must due to the complexity of the concepts and use for projects and exams.\n\nI highly recommend this course if you have never taken an AI course before as you will learn a ton. However, honestly gauge your knowledge and skills beforehand to see how much of your life you will have to give to be able to succeed. After taking two courses as a full-time student, I do not recommend another course at the same time if you work full-time unless you have expertise in python, numpy, and AI concepts. This is a great course for learning many of the concepts related to AI. However, I won't recommend taking this as a first course. This was my last course in the program having taken: CCA, ML, RL, CV, AI4R, DVA. Maybe this will be helpful for someone with a similar program track. I thought this course was not hard even though it was offered in the summer for the first time. \n\nThe lectures and reading material are not difficult to comprehend. I found the readings easy to understand due to how the amazing job the writers did. I made an effort to read all suggested chapters after watching the lectures. This will definitely help you to succeed in both the assignments and the exam. \n\nAssignments: Start early studying the requirements for these. Identify which part of the material you will need to solve them. However, don't start coding right away, the instructors were still making some modifications after the release date. Always prioritize coding efficiently. All assignments can be completed with runtimes less than 30 seconds. This will help you perform tests and modify your code faster. If your code is taking longer than that go back and try to find where it can be improved. \n\nExams: There were a midterm and a final both take home exams. Make sure you are caught up with the material (or at least most of it) before taking them. The questions are not hard and instructors were always there to clarify any possible ambiguity. They were also lenient with some questions when several students had a different interpretation of the problem statements. NOTE: Submit your pdf with what you did to get to the answer. They will give you partial credit if you got the answer wrong but your thought process was correct. \n\nStaff: In my opinion, the TAs did great. In spite of being the first summer offer, they handled the challenge well and were able to solve most issues. There were some problems with the final grading but my impression is that they eventually got resolved. \n\nI managed to get a 96% before the curve. They use the median to determine your letter grade: A = if you are above min(90%, median(final grades)). I am a professional software developer who had never taken a course like AI so almost all of the concepts were new. I had never coded in Python before this class that by the first two weeks, you better be ready to learn as you will already be coding and completing and application in that period of time. Aside the challenge, which I knew it would be, the course lectures were incredibly engaging and the assignments were incredibly tough and engaging. You will know in the first two-three weeks whether you will enjoy the challenge or be defeated by it; however, I will say that if you stick the course, it will be very rewarding. \n\nMy lessons learned and advice is to complete the lectures right away to let the concepts sink in and start the assignments early. You will not be able to do the assignment the night before (trust me, I tried and got burned once). Also, give a good amount of attention and time to the midterm and final. I failed to think the midterm would be as long as the assignments as I was wrong. Many of the polls stated people spent well over 20 hours on the midterm. Also, be sure to understand the grading structure as I completely missed the ball on that. For my semester, it was a curve where everyone above the mean got an A and the professor separated the class on two curves for on campus vs online (which was a point of contention for most but was explained with good reason as on campus had additional time & resources and the means were statistically different to show for it. )\n\nBest of luck in the class and hope you stick through the pain and relish in the accomplishment when you are done. 6 solo projects, highest 5 are 60% of grade (lowest doesn't count at all).  Midterm and final are 20% apiece.  Median and above Get an A, median to 1 stdev below B.\n\nUnless you've got a 100 on five projects, don't think that you can skip one.  The math won't work in your favor and more than a few students realized this too late.\n\nFinal stats for Spring '18 were not released, but looks like B range was 72+ and A range was 87+.\n\nProjects are frontloaded, with Adverserial Search (Minimax/AB Pruning/Iterative Deepening) and Search (A*, UCS, bi/tridirectional) being the hardest and most time consuming.  If they use the same style projects and you can make it through the first two you'll be fine.\n\nMidterm was tough and the final was a whole different beast.  Both were long take homes and open \"any course materials\" (nothing else allowed).  However clarifications on questions came throughout the week the assignment was open.  My big suggestion here is to take a stab early, then the weekend before the exam is due redo the exam with the clarifications, and figure out why any answers are different.\n\nYou don't need to be a python guru to do well in the class, but you should be comfortable programming in it.  I'd brush up on your statistics and matrix math as well (or at least be able to decode matrix math equations). This was a great course in which you could learn a lot. Of course, it is a little bit difficult, but you would have so much fun in the class and solving the assignment and you would learn so much that it is totally worth it. Professor Starner was fairly involved in the class and answering students questions which made the class more lovely and desirable. The assignments were well designed and TAs are really responsive and wanting to help My first class in the program and I love it. I took this with SDP as my first two courses during my first semester. Thad and the TAs were excellent in every way. They created challenging but rewarding projects and were very responsive to questions on Piazza. I would recommend taking this with a less difficult class as the projects and material are very time consuming and complex. Also, I had never used Python before, but the class would have been much easier if I had. An excellent introductary course to the field of AI. \nProf. Starner and all the TAs are a bunch of extremely passionate & dedicated group of people not only about the subject matter but to teach it. It's not like they demonstrated this passion once in a while but I've noticed the trend consistently through out the term; they've gone out of the way to explain things be-it assignments that each TA handled or holding office hours, answering questions on piazza etc. Not once did I feel a disconnect from the class. One thing that impressed me the most was Thad spending 2. 5 hrs giving a walk through of midterm; something that we don't see too often by any Prof of that class & calibre (such things are generally dealt by the TAs). Almost all the TA's were highly motivated, fun to work with on assignments & were highly responsive on piazza (sometimes even on holidays) & the best part was they are all humble enough to learn from any occasional mistakes that happened in setting up assignments or questions in the exams. \nThe course is pretty loaded (especially if you are working fulltime). There are 6 assignments, 1 midterm & 1 final exam. The assigments were all challenging covering various areas of AI. This is my 4th course & clearly I've spent the most number of sleepless nights(almost) during this term :)\nBoth the midterm & the finals are open book format & we had a full week to submit. This meant the questions were pretty open ended & challenging. Found this format of exam very benefitial. Gives you an opportunity to review the material well before answering. For once, it felt like it was testing what you know and not the 2-3 closed book formats which was testing more of what we don't know/remember. \n\nOverall, I'll recommend the class highly if you wish to explore & know more of what AI, ML etc is all about... One of, if not the hardest class in the program. Assignments are a lot of fun, but require fairly advanced python skills to go the extra mile. Exams are take home, but are extremely hard and time consuming. You are only given a week to complete and they are given concurrently with assignments. \n\nTLDR: very fun class, but come prepared and don't take it lightly. One of the most difficult courses in the degree but also one of the most useful.  It teaches you the advanced concepts of AI ,and be able to apply them. To be able to succeed in this course ,you need to have a good foundation on probability theory and advanced programming skills in python,otherwise,you may struggle alot to keep up with the  class. I personally was weak with probability concepts ,so had to struggle a lot.  Also keep in mind that some  the course  structure may change every semester as the professor considers each semester of AI as a research opportunity by trying out different things to see what works and what doesn't.  One of the hardest, challenging, and time consuming classes I have ever taken and I loved every minute of it.  The course is focused more on projects than theory which I prefer.   The six projects are fascinating and well worth the effort.  The exams are not proctored and you are given a full week to complete them.  They are both hard and extremely educational.  I learned more from these exams than I have ever learned from an exam in the past.  The lectures are excellent and taught by true experts.  Some TA's were difficult to understand when explaining projects, but this was a minor issue to me.  I think I disliked ALMOST everything about this course. The lectures were very understandable (too understandable) but kind of long (for the content), the book is just ok - often a savior though, the quizzes sometimes are unexplainably difficult considering the lectures they are attached to, and the assignments are just something else. \n\nIn very short, my main complaint is the amount of material crammed into this course. This course could have easily been broken into at least 2 parts, one probabilistic (Bayes nets, decision trees, others) and one deterministic (A*, constraint programming, adversarial search etc). Unfortunately, with everything thrown in, some stuff will suffer (and is unfortunate, most of the stuff is worth studying more carefully). \n\nA second complaint would be about the lectures. I had a hard time taking them seriously, most of the time prof. Starner and assistants try to paint a relaxed and jokey/fun atmosphere, in some sort of popularity contest style. Laudable try, but unfortunately it made the lectures lack the rigor they needed, which proved a problem for assignments. It was impossible (IMO) to approach any assignment with the lectures only, which presented a problem in itself - if one puts 3-4h/week in lectures, just to have to read another 3h from the AI book, that makes the lectures kind of useless. And one needs all the time possible for assignments. \n\nDon't want to insist too much, but various other things added to frustration: fighting Bonnie (with its arcane errors) for assignments, fighting with TAs about solutions for mid/end term exams, the grading on the curve (\"is it enough a 90% to get an A, when most assignments have 100% as median???\"), opening the course with \"adversarial search\" instead of with actual \"search algos\", and many other small issues. \n\nMaybe I'm too biased already, I would recommend people buy the AI book and study it at their own pace. A lot cheaper and a lot less frustrating.  Quote: this course is a survey of algorithmic hacks to NP-hard problems. In reality, it was interesting to learn about present-state AI research from prof. Starner and his work in Sign Language recognition, wearable computing, and Dolphin communication. This course was the initial offering of 6601 for the OMSCS program. The professor and the TAs input an enormous amount of effort to pull off this course - my thanks to them. As a note of context, this course was advertised to be offered in Spring '16 and then cancelled late Fall '15 and then surprisingly re-released at the 11th hour. \n\nAs the course advertises in its description, it is intended for those who have some background in AI or are ready to jump into the deep end (true statement) The description asks for 9 hrs per week and it should be modified to reflect the true effort required in this class. Most students, including myself, input 20+ hours per week to stay afloat. Most of the time you spend will be on solving an assignment and researching. It's very easy to forget that you have to watch the lectures as well! \n\nThe professor's assignment methodology was to introduce a concept through lecture, then complete some 'warm-up' problems in the beginning of each assignment to develop intuition. At the end of the warm-up, you solve more difficult problems by implementing solutions that had not been explicitly covered in class. This was certainly the most rewarding and difficult part of the class!\n\nThere were several first-time hiccups in assignments and exams, however the TAs and the professor had open ears and minds and ultimately made it right and I'm sure that the next offering of this course will be even better. \n\nI learned an incredible amount about the material even though I felt overwhelmed during the majority of the course. This is certainly an opportunity to become familiar with the AI field with an intensive, hands-on experience from which you will benefit greatly.  I enjoyed the class a lot. It covers a lot of topics, backed by the ultimate Russell/Norvig AI book. The lectures are a combination of old videos by Norvig/Thrun and new content by Thad Starner and head TA Shelly Baghi. The quality of the new content is amazing, with subtle jokes and animations; the old ones are poorer. Along with the book and lectures there is additional material usually linked to from the week's overview or some assignments, or by other students on Piazza. You might also find more content online; I personally liked lectures from the AI class at UC Berkeley (http://ai. berkeley. edu/course_schedule. html). With practically everyone drawing from the same book, you'll keep running into the same examples over and over again but sometimes having it explained by another person just makes the idea click. \n\nThere were 6 assignments, with best 5 counting towards your grade (worst score is dropped). They require you to understand the algorithms in theory and be comfortable with Python. They usually consist of several parts, starting with basics and progressively diving deeper, offering bonus points for implementing advanced algorithms described in attached papers. The assignments were the best part of the course in terms of learning but at the same time could be very annoying when you're trying to find a bug in a complicated algorithm. It's just not the type of problem you can solve quickly on StackOverflow. \n\nMidterm and final exams starting with our semester were open book. They each took about 10 hours to complete and motivated you to consult the book/lectures to fully understand the topics before committing to an answer. \n\nOn average I spent about 10 hours per week on the class (counted by Toggl) but by no means it's an easy class. Unless you're a skilled programmer and used to watching lectures at 2x speed, you could easily end up needing twice as much.", 
    "CS-6750": "  The subject was fascinating and the lectures did a very good job of covering the materials. If you ever wanted to know about Human Computer Interaction or what makes good design then this is a good course. \n\nThe professor was very good about communicating via Piazza which was a huge plus. The Piazza for this course was the most active and interesting of the courses I've taken. Office hours via Slack weren't as successful but the professor was available and answered questions. \n\nThere are many assignments and they can each take a fair amount of time -- especially the final project. The projects aren't time sync's the way some software projects are but plan ahead or you'll find yourself spending a time at the last minute trying to get the work done. This is a great course but does require you stay current with the assignments and weekly readings. Be prepared to do lots of writing and designing. No coding.\n\nPros:\nHigh quality lectures\nConsistent writing weekly assignments\nGrading is more than fair\n\nCons:\nThere are a lot of weekly readings which are often very dry and easy to fall behind on. If you do then you\u2019ll regret it on the exams.\n\n A great class .. tells you a lot about the interfaces we deal with ... I think its a must class for anyone trying to go the entrepreneurial route of developing any mobile app .. you'll know a lot about what distinguishes a good interface from a bad one. Its a theoretical course, where you'd have to write a lot.\n\nInstructors are extremely responsive .. Effort from them is clearly visible ..\nThere are 10 assignments; each due Sunday of every week, 1 individual project (more like an assignment), and 1 group project ( which you'll do with 2 other people, and spans over a month).\nThere are 3 peer feedbacks required every week for previous weeks assignments of your classmates, which will count for yours participation grade. There is 10% participation grade. You'll have to gather participation tokens by filling out surveys from your classmates, which they'll post for their assignment and projects at piazza. A tip is that at the end of class, people share multiple tokens for their surveys (like i offered to share 6 tokens to get my group project filled in). \nThere are 2 Tests, each valued 15% of your grade. Include the course material you've completed uptil now , and the assigned readings. There are 30 questions in total (1 point each) and 1 extra credit question (10 points), so a total of 31 question. The extra credit question can bump your score to 85% only. which means, if your score is 75 - 84 % for 30 questions, the 31st question can bump it only to 85 % .. If you're beyond 85 already, extra credit question will not be considered. Very interesting course. There was no coding assignment. All about writing each week for 10 weeks and 2 test covering the topics and 2 projects as well. Great course! I highly recommend taking it. It will require writing a lot of papers, but you will learn a lot. This was an excellent course. \n\nThe lectures are more rapid than other courses I have taken, I found myself having to pause and rewind in order to capture information. However, the quality of the lectures is perhaps the best I have ever experienced in OMSCS. (The only thing that bothered me was one of the fonts used - a carbon copy of my former employers' corporate typeface that initially triggered some PTSD. ) The exams are open notes, so the quality of your own notes is very important if you want to do well on the exam. I still had to go back and watch lectures for a few questions, but having structured notes made it easy to quickly find that specific lecture. \n\nEach week had individual assignments which usually take 3-4 hours if you want to do a good job and earn an A. There are word limits, so leave no word unturned and revise, revise, revise to fit that word count! Taking notes for all the coursework can be really helpful in your written work because you will need to refer to the concepts you learn in the lectures. \n\nThere is an individual project that you can complete over time, or within a week if you dedicate a few hours a day to it - I did feel a bit rushed to complete it before the deadline. There's a team project, and of course, YMMV based on the strength of your team. Be ready to learn how to write surveys or perform interviews, which can be challenging if you are lacking in soft skills!\n\nOne of the more interesting experiences you'll have with Dr. Joyner is that this is very much an \"open standard\" (not necessarily \"open source\") course. When students post feedback about the course structure, or something that didn't work quite right, Dr. J is extremely forthright about how he might change or improve the course. Since user-centric design principles focus on receiving feedback to inform iteration and continuous improvement, it's no surprise he does the same for his courses. Liked the class a lot. Instructor is very good and the content is awesome. \n\nThe only thing I dislike about it is the assignments. Really, I think the assignments are graded by keyword and not whether or not you actually understood something. Example, in assignment M2, I think I tried to imply a concept demonstrated in the videos versus flat out mention it by name and I received a deduction for that. Assignments are also graded strictly with content from the videos meaning sometimes if a whole 20% of an assignment can come from 1-2 minutes of video lectures (screwed up in my opinion). If they can fix the assignments, the course would turn from good to awesome in my opinion. The summer schedule seems incredibly compressed. The first 3 assignments & the individual project were doable with the 1 week/submission schedule. However, the second phase of M assignments go through a complete cycle of a UI design, from needs finding to prototype construction and evaluation. Almost all of these all require input from an external group: either friends or family or the other students for the need finding and review activities. The same has to be done, this time in a group context for the group project. A little more time is allowed for the group project as it only has to be in at the end of the semester. \n\nThe logistics of that into a forced march of a 1 week cadence make this unworkable for me to integrate into work&school&travel. \n\nI think if one is able to dedicate a non Summer semester to this alone, it could be doable. But for Summer, I think the course workload is unrealistic. Just too much logistics which detract from the content. It would be better to have a single project, with enough time to get all the reviewers logistics organized and submit towards the end of the semester. I don't think it's necessary to have a group project. Any advantages from a group can be had from allowing students to review the various steps, and better yet, be able to incorporate that feedback into your work. (The way a real review at work would be used). \n\nBTW one disappointment is that in order to have a project you can use at work, you need to submit an application to an IRB of some sort. Again this throws in a logistical detail, as something like cannot be organized within a week, yet, that's all you have if you keep to the 1 week cadence. Without some incredible foresight or preparation, the whole thing is unworkable for a custom project. You basically *have* to take a play project, and use your fellow students as the users. \n\nBBTW I seem to be writing about a different course than the people below, perhaps the assignments were reworked? This is a very good class. Although it is a very easy class, the material is interesting. Dr. Joyner is an excellent professor and he is very engaged, so were all the TA's. The projects are actually really interesting. I wasn't a big fan of the group project. The assignments are easy, a lot of writing though. I would recommend this class if you are looking to get a good intro to HCI. This is a great class to take over the summer. First, let me say that this class is great.   You will learn a lot if you've never taken a course on HCI.  Dr. Joyner is very active, both on the slack channel and the Piazza forums.  He is very helpful and I will take other courses by him.  There is very little TA involvement though.  \n\nAbout the course:\nThere are 10 assignments that are basically reports.  They require around 1600 words per paper.  These are fine and will help you understand the material well.  They can get a bit boring after awhile though.\n\nThere are two projects.  The individual project isn't difficult at all and I felt it was just like another assignment.  The group project was a repeat of 5 of the assignments you had already done, but now in a group.  If you can choose your own group.  My group was fine, but didn't communicate well.  I felt that I did a majority of the work.  \n\nThere are too many readings.  They start off interesting and get worse as you go.  I quit reading them after the midterm because I needed to spend more time in another class.  By doing so, my midterm grade went down 10 points.  This implies to me that they aren't that important.\n\nThe tests are open book.  I found them to be rough.  We got two hours to take them, but I think in the future they will only be 90 minutes.  Anyways, I didn't do the readings for them and still got a good grade, but I used all two hours and they were open book.  If the tests are not two hours in the future, you may want to make sure you do the readings as I always ran out of time when I searched through the readings for the answers to test.\n\nOverall, great class.  Loved it and Dr. Joyner is fantastic.  I highly recommend this class.  It would make a good pairing with a second course. I found this class to be paced quite well for a summer offering. I tracked the time I spent on this class down to the minute, and spent an average of 9 hours a week watching lectures, doing assignments, or reading Piazza. This is definitely a class where you'll get out of it what you put into it. There are extra reading assignments that you can do (for fun), you can interact on Piazza about questions offered up in the videos, and Dr. Joyner really tries to facilitate student interaction on Piazza. Also, these videos were by far my favorite in the program (out of 10 classes taken). \n\nThe assignments were generally pretty straightforward writeups that were directly correlated with the lectures. We learned and went through the design lifecycle over the course of 5 assignments (1 assignment/week). While parts of this felt a little rushed due to the need to get outside participation in surveys or interviews in a week's span, the assignments themselves were light (~1000 words), yet informative. This class provided a glimpse into what it looks like to iterate through the design lifecycle with a focus on user-centered design, which I felt was informative and necessary for creating high quality solutions to problems. \n\nI would be slightly concerned about a lack of rigor during the fall or spring semesters, when students have 6 extra weeks to move through the material, but I guess there is plenty of room to perform needfinding to a fuller extent or create higher fidelity prototypes. Even so, I would assume this would be a relatively light class, and could pair well with a more time-intensive class. Very good course. Provides lot of very useful information about the principles and methods to be followed while doing human computer interaction design. \n\nCourse is very well structured and organized. The lectures are done quite well with an intention to make students understand the topic under discussion. The Professor, TAs and fellow students are very active and supportive in Piazza. Assignments, Tests and Projects are very thought provoking and highly oriented towards the material's application in contemporary industry and practical life. Grading is exceptional. \n\nAltogether, great experience and have learnt a lot from this course. Highly recommend taking this course. First of all, let me say that Professor Joyner is a great professor and the TA's were great. Very responsive and understanding, and he always seems to be trying to improve the class. The lectures were expertly done and mostly enjoyable, and the content is useful and interesting. \n\nHowever, for some reason I just did not enjoy the class overall. I believe the main reason was the assignments. I had to force myself to do almost every one because I always felt like the assignments did not improve my understanding of the topics from the lectures - they were just \"busy work\" to me. I gained a good understanding of the course material after watching the lectures but I found myself spending hours trying to brainstorm ideas to apply that material to the essay-style questions that make up the assignments. In other words, I spent more time trying to come up with interfaces to write about than time learning the material. My feelings towards this might stem from the fact that I am a coder at heart and there were not any assignments that leveraged that. \n\nIn summary, if you don't mind doing a lot of brainstorming about different interfaces and writing about redesigns for them, then this class is great. If you decide to skip out on this course, at least bookmark the lectures and watch them in your free time - they are definitely worth it. It was my first semester. The course is learning about the design process of software from scratch. The course include great concepts that can be applied to software development process. \nThe course has a lot of writing around 800 word per week. You do not need coding for this course, but you need basic drawing skills to make prototype or design template. I really recommend this course to sw engineers, it help a lot when you create application.    Pros:<br>\nLectures are high-quality<br>\nCourse material is well organized<br>\nInstructors are responsive on Piazza\n\nCons:<br>If you actually do all the required readings you will probably need more than 10 hours per week. I have mixed feelings on the readings. Yes they add value, but to me it was not enough value to justify the time spent reading everything, taking notes, looking up terminology, etc. Fortunately you don't need to memorize the readings (tests are open-notes).\n\nOverall this is a good course. If you are very interested in HCI then the readings will probably be engaging for you. If your perspective on this course is to be more well-rounded through an introductory exposure to HCI, then you don't <em>need</em> the readings but don't totally ignore them because they are included on the tests.\n\nYou don't need to write any code for this course, but you will be writing a lot of English : ) TL;DR: Good class, with an engaged professor, talking about interesting things, but the summer is packed and can cause some panic if you don't adequately balance out your work. \n\nAs all the other reviews say, the subject matter is interesting, and the lectures handle it all very well. Each assignment applies a specific portion of the class which allows for you to solidify the content in the lectures. \n\nThe main negative I have is that the summer class felt rushed, and there was this heightened level of stress throughout the semester as there was something new to do every week. There is no breathing room, which I suppose is common for a summer course. It is possible to front load things early on, which is a HUGE plus to me. \n\nNOTE: a review below says you have to fill out your own application to an IRB, that is not true. There is a class wide umbrella. You DO have to take an online class to understand what an IRB is, how it is applied, etc. That takes a couple of hours, and is MORE than just logistics. It teaches you the importance of the laws that surround research with human subjects. Overall, this was a very informative and enjoyable course. Dr. Joyner does a great job of trying to keep improving the program and he is active in responding to any questions.\n\nThere are two tests (all multiple choice) that is open book and relatively straight forward (not necessarily easy). All assignments and projects are graded relatively fairly. Make sure to synthesize the learning and incorporate lecture notes.\n\nGrading is generous relative to other courses; however, you do need to commit the time and effort to get the A. Great class, taught by Dr Joyner, who keeps the course interesting and fun with his entertaining examples and engaging lectures. Also staying very active on the forum and ensuring that students understand the mechanics of the course and the material. It's a fairly easy class, but I appreciated that because I actually had time to read the books, papers, and spend time going in depth into the area of project interests. Great class! Although this course does not have any programming assignment, it actually has a very heavy workload. Every week there is one assignment due which requires 1,200 words. The instructor David is very passionate about this course and he is very active on Piazza. The grading policy is very generous. The course is not difficult, but in my opinion it's about the effort that you put in. Some others that I spoke to were spending less then 5 hours a week on the course and they did well. I personally spent around 15 - 20 hours during the first few weeks of the course and steadily was able to reduce my time to around 8-12 hours towards the last month or so. The readings are lengthy at times and there are multiple to get through. I found it hard to digest and remember the opinions of each author/researcher, but getting through the readings helped me to better understand the theory behind HCI and the many views around it. Coming from a computer science undergrad and working in industry as a software engineer for several years, this class definitely helps as I have been on the UI/UX side more times then I can count and it's an area that I find doesn't get enough attention in many of the companies I worked with.  Definitely a great course to start the omscs program! Be prepared to turn in an assignment every week for 10 weeks, watch lectures which are engaging and informative and read a few papers each week. The course is doable provided you do what is required of you each week. You also have the ability to work ahead as videos/assignments/readings/projects are all laid out and accessible from the start of the semester! \nThe most challenging part of the course were the tests as they are a little tricky especially when it comes to the structure of questions.  This is an early review based on the first online offering of HCI in Fall '16. As I write this review, we're only 10 weeks in the course. \n\nI have a BS in CS, and this makes me familiar with some topics in HCI, such as Usability. I'd say it is an intro to the broad field of HCI. There is no prerequisite for CS 6750, and you'll be perfectly fine with a different background. \n\nThe workload is very light at 15 h/w, more or less. There is one written assignment each week, which consists of four questions, and each should be answered with up to 300 words. Answering the questions requires watching weekly lectures, and reflecting on their objectives. These assignments are publicly available at: http://omscs6750. gatech. edu/fall-2016/full-course-calendar/\n\nCS6750 is very different from code-intensive courses that have coding assignment (e. g. CS 6300 SDP). In HCI, you will describe and analyze user interfaces. I think everyone that designs computerized products should take this course. It gives you a different perspective to look at your tasks, and the interface you use to achieve your goals. \n\nThe Video Lectures are not publicly available, but you can view the Scripts at: https://drive. google. com/drive/folders/0B1-VjNQe61hsYi1YanNYYzdkd3c\n\nIn addition to weekly assignments, there are two exams that should be taken via Proctortrack. These exams are open-note; which means you may watch the lectures as you answer the exams, or review your notes. \n\nFacts:\nNo required textbook or readings. \nNo coding assignments. \nGrades are not curved ( B >= 80, A >= 90 ). \nInstructor is very active in Piazza. \n\nHCI should be perfect for Summer. It can also be combined with another course with Low-to-Medium workload. I really enjoy the way Dr. Joyner teaches a class. Everyone seems to be generally interested in the subject which you can tell by the overall activity in Piazza. \n\nI think this is one of those classes where you get out of it what you put in. It's easy to get an A. But Dr. Joyner gives you all of the tools to really learn about the subject and explore the concept of HCI. You will get weekly papers where you have the opportunity to expand on previous designs. It makes for an interesting class. If you work as a software developer and are responsible for building interfaces, this is a fabulous course to take. It's also a must-take if you work (or would like to work) in a software startup and will have product development responsibility. \n\nThe first half of the class focuses on heuristics - what are characteristics of great design. The second half focuses on the design lifecycle. It gives you a process for designing and refining interfaces. It's a very practical approach that I think maps very well to industry. It reminds me a lot of Lean Startup and how to arrive at a great interface using qualitative and quantitative data, and minimizing risk and time. \n\nIf you've taken a course from Dr. Joyner before, you know that he turns out a quality product and works continuously to improve it. This course is well-run. The lectures are to-the-point. He also has lots of \"5 Tips for X\" videos that help boil down the content to practical, actionable steps. \n\nI found the grading somewhere between fair and generous. On your research projects, it's also ok to have ideas that don't work out, as long as you explore them properly. \n\nAll in all, a great course. Best class I've ever taken.  Perfect balance of fun, new skills, applicability to real world and unlikely to have seen material before.\n\nAssignments are very manageable.  There is always a week to do them and most take 2 hours at the most.  It's pretty easy to work ahead and build up some buffer.  Exams are very representative of the material and, if you watch all the lectures and take good notes, you'll likely get an A.\n\nThere is a group assignment but it's way better than in most classes.  It's easy enough that, even if your team isn't helping, you could do it by yourself and still ace it.\n\nLectures are perfect and the materials is something you can use for the rest of your life. The professor is fantastic! The class logistics are awesome-- all assignments are graded within a week. The Piazza forum is attended to promptly. The assignments are more essay oriented than I was expecting. Also plan to spend time on getting the word count right. Check out http://omscs6750.gatech.edu/spring-2018/ for more information.\n\nLecture material is fantastic. The examples and explanations are well-chosen and clear.\n\nThe individual assignments are good, but I think there's too many of them. All assignments are writing assignments with ~1200 words. I felt like I was jumping through a lot of hoops each week to complete all the assignments. I like the P Assignments on design (P)rinciples better than the M Assignments on (M)ethods. It's a fun course overall, and it gets you thinking about how people interact with technology in the real world.\n\nLots of required readings. Questions on the exam cover lectures and readings. I recommend taking notes on the lectures and the readings since exams are open-note.\n\nLike all of Dr. Joyner's classes, the communication on Piazza is well-organized and constant. The course hums along smoothly. The grading was a bit slow this semester, but many TAs fell ill or dropped off which is understandable.\n\nDefinitely recommend this course! [This review was completed mid-term]\n\nThis is an excellent course. The content is interesting, it is very well organized, and the assessments and exercises are great. The work load is light. This course would be a good candidate for a two-course semester. The course has no programming, completely theory based. For the final project, if you want you can build a working prototype. \nIn summary, this course is writing, writing and more writing.\nThere are 10 assignments and 2 projects. There are two types of assignments P-type and M-type, P is based on principles and M is based on methods.\nLectures are very engaging and drive home the concepts very well. If you have already working in UX and/or designing great apps, then this course will be a cake walk and you just need to spend only 5 to 6 hours per week. However, I come from an embedded background with no UX experience, so all the concepts were new and I needed more time. \nThe strategy that works best is to choose a domain and a problem in that domain that you want to solve and a few apps that you can review. You watch the lecture on a Monday, read the questions to be answered for the assignment, internalize the concept and apply them on everything you do in the next three days, then just reflect on your experience for the questions asked in the assignment.\nWe have two proctored exams and they are a bit tough. Take proper notes while watching the lectures and diligently read all the weekly readings. The readings were made compulsory from Fall 2017 and 1/3 of the questions in the test come from those. As I didn't do the readings, my test scores are not great. \nThis can be easily taken along with another intermediate course, if the other one is full of programming like CV or AI then this writing will complement the heavy programming. The lecture materials were excellent. Communication with the professor is great. The assignments were thought provoking and interesting. One of the best courses in the program. My biggest mistake was taking this class along with another one. It should be noted that when I took this class, I had already satisfied all other requirements for graduation outside of 3 electives, so needless to say I am very burnt out. \n\nDr. Joyer is great, and probably one of the best OMSCS professors. He is very active in Piazza and slack and gives you meaningful feedback, and detail on why he does what. During this semester they tried a new grading scale, where for projects A's were all 100%, B's were 80%, C's were 70% and so on, meaning that there is no way to get a 90% or a 85%. I didn't really like this because it seemed to penalize borderline work IMO. \n\nOverall this class was a lot of work. It wasn't technical but there was always something due. I felt pretty overwhelmed after a few weeks of trying to balance two classes. I am not sure if this was always the case, but I felt that the previous reviews were sort of a lie.\n\nGreat class but lots of writing and work.  An easy-going class with interesting but not technical material. The instructor is very good, always engaging and supportive. I really enjoyed the class at the beginning but towards the end I favored my AI class more because I found it more interesting. There is a fair amount of writing you have to do for this class, and a good amount of thinking and choosing different interfaces to analyze - which wasn't always easy. Favorite OMSCS class so far. I learned a ton, enjoyed the material, the lectures were awesome, the assignments are interesting, and the tests are fair. The only thing I would ask to change is for their to be some variation in the assignments. They get kind of repetitive after awhile. 90% of the time you are asked to write 1200 words to answer 4 questions. The instructor and TAs are very active on piazza and they grade assignments quickly! I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and it really changed my perspective on how to design interfaces.  Dr. Joyner is a fantastic instructor, and this course was one of the best I've taken in the OMSCS program.  \n\nBefore I took this course, I had a vague sense of what made a poor user interface, and this course teaches you the underlying principles of usability and user-centered design.  After the course, I can now analyze and articulate how an interface could be improved based on user-centered design principles.\n\nThe course has two main lesson tracks that were taught in parallel: **Methods** and **Principles**. \n\n **Methods** focuses on the process of conducting HCI research such as understanding regulations about testing with human subjects, performing needfinding (understanding needs of the user), brainstorming approaches, prototyping, and evaluating designs.  All of this is comprises the design lifecycle.  \n\n**Principles** focuses on the design principles in HCI, such as the *Gulf of Execution* (how the user figures out what they want to do and how to do it) and the *Gulf of Evaluation* (did the interface respond how the user expected?).  You also will learn about concepts that improve usability and the limitations of users (human abilities).  This was my favorite portion of the course.\n\n**Assignments:** Weekly assignments were due that usually required 1200-1500 words of writing based on that week's lecture content.  I found these assignments to be easy but useful.  I usually spent 3-4 hours writing each assignment, but the **Methods** assignments required outside work that took a few hours to perform (conducting needfinding with others, developing prototypes, etc). \n\n**Tests:** There are two tests that cover the first half of the course and the second half of the course.  The two tests are open-book and open-note (including Udacity and papers) extremely straightforward (not necessarily easy), but there's no trickery involved or gotcha questions.  Dr. Joyner provided a terrific analysis after the exams to identify problematic questions and other potential test issues.  \n\n**Projects:**\nThere is an individual project and a group project where you go through a round of the design lifecycle by yourself (individual project) and then as a group (group project).  These projects primarily reinforce the material in the **Methods** lectures as you practice what you've learned in them.\n\n**tl;dr:** Excellent course.  Not super difficult.  Very enjoyable.  Great if you want to learn more about designing good UI/UX. This was an excellent class.  The videos were some of the best int he OMSCS program.  They were very clear and built on previous information in an interesting and coherent manner.  Prof Joyner is very involved in the class and actively improving the content.  He is very open about why he makes changes and answers questions very quickly.\n\nI have had several UI design classes before, but this was the most comprehensive with key areas highlighted clearly in ways that will stick with me for a long time.\n\nI took this course at the same time as Intro to Health Informatics and was able to combine group projects for both courses, making the group projects more manageable.  It didn't reduce the workload significantly, but allowed us to focus on one project and go into it in more depth than we would otherwise have been able to.\n\nAll assignments were posted at the beginning of the semester making it easier to fit schedules where you need to front load work or where you'll be unavailable in the middle of the semester (though you still need to coordinate with your team for the final project). \n\n\n\n** AS OF SPRING '18 THIS IS BOTH AN II ELECTIVE AND A FOUNDATIONAL COURSE **\n\nA fine class from Dr. Joyner, who stayed involved throughout and should be a model for the profs in other courses who basically let their TAs run the asylum.  10 weekly assignments,  one individual and one group project, two totally open book tests, and a 'class participation' grade (point for Piazza posts, peer reviews, and participating in surveys by other class students).  You are assigned three student papers at random weekly to review; these peer reviews are likely the least effective thing in the course with many of your fellow students offering a whole sentence or two as 'feedback'.   You also have 3-5 required readings each week which reinforce the Udacity lectures (well done by Dr. Joyner, updated frequently).  There is no programming required.\n\nThe basic course structure entails learning the principals and methods of HCI, with weekly assignments being split between the two tracks.  Assignments are used to demonstrate a grasp of concepts prior to the projects which put you through re-designing an interface of your choice.  Workload is manageable, allow a couple of hours for the readings, 1-2 more for the lectures, anywhere from 2-6 for the assignment/projects.  You do have to allot 4-6 more hours early in the semester to take mandatory Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training.\n\nThe grading system is a work in progress; this semester, assignments and projects were graded on hard A-B-C-D-F basis with an equal number of points for each grade (e.g. for a project worth 150 points, each grade gets you 37.5 points).   Tests were multiple choice with you receiving 1 point for each answer you correctly selected or did not select.  For some reason the grade scheme allowed basically anyone to get a B because the total number of points to get a B was 626 of the available 1000 points (63%).  An 88% overall grade gets you an A.  There was a TA shortage as the semester progressed (several had to drop for one reason or another), so grading slowed substantially the second half of the semester.  The TAs were basically invisible other than grading and the very occasional answer on Piazza, but their absence was not felt because Dr. Joyner was so engaged.   NOTE:  Dr Joyner today (6May18) said that this will be the last semester of the letter grade experiment, so expect a return to traditional point-based grading.   \n\nThis was a very enjoyable course thanks to the energy and enthusiasm Dr. Joyner displays for the material *and* online learning. The material was interesting and the concepts are certainly something you can use in real life.  This course was just added as an II elective and I would recommended it for those seeking that specialization. Very easy class, but it does involve a lot of writing and doing peer feedback that nobody reads. Take this class if you want to boost your GPA. I think 70+% of the people who took the class ended up with an A in the class. Don't get me wrong though, it's a lot of work, but not difficult work, just a lot of busy work. HCI course is one of my favs in this program. You have the opportunities to explore a whole different world of Computer Science area. I personally learnt a lot from this course. This is an essay-based course. You would expect many readings and writings. But it was fun. This is also a great course to take with some other heavy coding course in one semester.", 
    "CS-7637": " This is the only course in OMSCS which I found disappointing so far. Instructor and TA are great and helpful. However, I didn't felt I learnt anything much. Main reasons being: \n1. Lectures give interesting overview but they lack the depth compared to other courses that I took in previous semesters. \n2. In project work, visual approach is mandatory by the end and it involves mostly ad-hoc heuristics for RPM problems rather than any widely applicable AI algorithms. So you don't get hands on practice of learnt concepts. However, in textual approach I was able to implement some general technique based on learnt concepts, avoiding most hard coding or ad-hoc heuristics. \n3. Assignments are just essays about possible applications of techniques. So you again lack hands-on exposure. \nWith 3 projects (with reflection write-up), assignments and peer feedback, it felt more like busy work.  I really can't understand why so many people enjoyed this class. It seemed like we were being encouraged to be creative by having deliberately ambiguous assignment descriptions. Yet, when I put my own spin on things, my grades didn't come out well. I felt like I was guessing at requirements, and was extremely uncomfortable writing my essays as a result. In the end, I had a sense of what the TAs look for (though it's hit-or-miss depending on who you get), and I wrote to that. Beware if you have a different thought than what's accepted!\nThe word count in the assignments is a lie. You need to double or triple it, add about six or seven diagrams and probably some pseudo-code. I got burned on the first reflection because it was too short and I didn't understand what they were looking for. \nThe class was hard because in a sense, the ideas were too simple. I didn't feel like I was learning anything and so I didn't even know what I could write about. \nI didn't like Dr. Goel. He didn't seem respectful of the fact that I was having difficulty understanding what the requirements were. I felt like I was guessing, and he would just disagree when I attempted an idea (but not give me any clues as to how to continue). It seemed lazy, like he didn't actually want to think about my problem--but then, why even respond?\nThe TAs were fine, and helped me out with some of the issues I had. Their feedback on my assignments was insufficient, but they actually helped me with some of my questions and seemed to care about how well my Raven's solutions were going. \nIn the end, I was disappointed and I think I may have wasted four months banging my head against the wall, trying to find meaning in a class that just doesn't have any.  This is a survey course in KBAI so lots of material without getting in depth. Personally I liked that. If you are comfortable writing technical papers you will be fine in this course as all assignments and exams are written. The writing do take up some times. The RPM project is good but I thought it did not really offer to apply any real AI techniques since grading counts on how many of RPM you are getting right instead of what technique you have used - a bit disappointing. \nLectures are easy to understand. Professor and TA's are great and goes above and beyond to help (they held office hours on weekends!). Overall, it's a good class but have room for improvement.  This is a very well run class.  The material was interesting for a bit, but it soon felt extremely dated.  The main project was to to write an AI to take a visual IQ test.  Some students took part in an alternate NLP QA project.  If you have the chance, definitely get into that alternate project.  The IQ test was interesting at first, but quickly grew tiresome.  The NLP project was very open ended, but a lot of fun to work on.  Overall, solid class, reasonable difficulty and pace, the alternate project really made it. I started this class, loving it. The project was addicting and I was competitive with myself as well as others to get the best score. In this class, you will implement an agent to take an IQ test called the Raven's Progressive Matrices test. You will be given two sets of problems to learn from, one graded and the other not. There will be two similar sets of questions that you'll get when submitted to the autograder, here to, one graded, one not. \nThen came the writing, there is a lot of writing in this class. Three project reflections, three assignments on nothing related to the class, a midterm and a final. Totally 15, 000+ words on the minimum, and if you want to secure a good grade, at least 20, 000. \nThis not only became a drain, but a bother to complete. \nThe lectures had little to do with the class, and the depth was nonexistent. I feel that I learned little, while just enjoying the programming and creativity. \nHowever, the TAs were lenient in grading and very understanding. As a whole, we started to somewhat complain that our midterm and final essays were high level architectures with little value, so they offered an alt-final, where students could develop their midterm NLP chatbot design into a real program, I can't image many other teachers agreeing to offer a second final for students who didn't feel they were learning enough. This really shows the type of education that GT is offering, as well as this class. \nI hope they sort out the kinks in this class, it has the potential to be a great class. Very, very interesting course that is incredibly rewarding to complete. It does take some work and thinking, but is doable assuming you have the time to put into it. \n\nI felt the course papers were excellent opportunities to write things down and synthesize what was going on. The final exam was the same way. The assignments are a bit challenging at times, but are again doable and you will learn during them :)\n\nDefinitely take this course! It is a time consuming course due to its emphasis on writing and expectations in terms of diagrams, flow charts/ Pseudocode etc. Both mid term and final are take home exams of answering 6 questions. The project is incremental which is solving raven's progressive matrices. It feels overwhelming initially. Project 1 and 2 can choose verbal/visual approach and project 3 is just visual. I felt it is better to start with just visual from beginning which will make life easier as it progresses. Projects require coding in Python. I had not much prior experience but going through the required pillow library once helped a lot. Overall, a normal yet time consuming course to start the program with. The grading is liberal, answering the rubric questions with appropriate headings will do the trick. I took this course along with ML which caused a lot of trouble as both being time consuming. The Professor and TAs are very active and the course is planned very well. Overall, a good course with fixed expectations. I really loved this class. Professor Goel is amazing!! He is very active on piazza and sometimes I wondered whether he slept at all :) Piazza threads are super organized, so if when there were close to 10, 000 posts, you could read what was relevant to you. I have no ML or AI background, given that I found the lectures very informative, some students in the class who had taken ML didn't like the contents much! The lectures make the concepts look very easy because they use very simple daily life example but when you want to write the assignment on a useful AI problem, it is very very tough!! The projects are solving RPM puzzles; while it was enjoyable and rewarding to write python programs that solve complex visual analogy puzzles, I felt let down that I couldn't use any of the AI concepts that we learnt in them. At the end of each video David Joyner does gives tips on how the techniques could be used in RPM puzzle but even then it was difficult applying them. Videos talk a lot about learning and reasoning but we were given no guidance on how to write such a program. From Spring 2016, the course work is cut down a bit, we only had 3 assignments, 3 projects, 1 midterm and 1 final. We get 3 weeks for doing the project and 1 week for assignments. Midterm and final are both open ended and open book and are given 1 week each. I have given 15 hours/week but I think you can do with 10 hours/week if you are very goal oriented and super focused unlike me. Whatever be your specialization, I think you should take this course to get the most professional OMSCS experience!! A lot of reviewers talk about the practicality of it, however I thought the syllabus was really clear. The lectures were meant to be at a 1000 foot level, but there was enough follow up resources in T-square (resource section) to continue learning about each area. I also rented the recommended book from Amazon, and this enhanced the class for me as well. You get as much as you put in with this class. A really great course with fun lectures and fantastic projects. The exams did a great job of making us synthesize what we'd learned. I actually enjoyed them. :) This is a decent course. The workload is decent, you have to write assignment papers and reflections. Programming wise you can use Java or Python. I have a CS background and it started out a bit difficult, but after learning more and being able to see examples after the fact really makes the process much easier and fun. If you are into AI or agents or even the cognitive process then you'll enjoy this class. The lectures gave great examples and were easy to follow. You really didn't have to read much outside of watching the lectures. \n\nI struggled a bit with their system for turning in projects, but once I got it solved it was a non-issue. Overall I'd say it is a decent class to take for the summer - if you don't have a strong CS background I wouldn't recommend taking the class as an \"easy\" secondary class.  I really liked this course. The course lectures were pretty interesting and were supplemented by some optional readings. Definitely do the optional readings to get a better understanding of the material. This course has an iterative project that has you solving Ravens Progressive Matrices. Starting out can be fairly overwhelming, but I found the project to be incredibly interesting and enjoyable to work on. My only issue with the course is the amount of writing involved. You have to write papers of varying length for 3 Assignments, Two Exams, and Each of your Projects. It can be a lot and towards the end I was definitely feeling a little writers fatigue from it. I want to echo a few other reviews here. In terms of logistics, this class has to be one of the most well run course in OMSCS. However, I didn't like the material that much. For the written assignments, once you learn how to get good grade, it becomes rather tedious. I use visual for all the projects which make them become rather easy. My result is great for P1 and P2, but for P3 I don't really care any more because after the first two I feel like I learn as much as I can from the project. \n\nI can't help feeling like I walk away from this course not learning a lot. I didn't spend a lot of time exploring outside of the lecture. In fact, I did barely the minimum. Other people seems to have a really good experience though! Great class. Professors Goel and Joyner are obviously extremely interested in the topic matter and it shines through in the incredibly well constructed lecture videos. The class is rigorous enough to make you feel like you're really learning, but not so challenging or time consuming that you have to give up other aspects of your life. I loved the class initially, which waned over time to just a friendly affection. What I loved initially was the content, the lecture quality, and the quizzes. The project seemed fun at first blush, but I struggled with the vagueness of it. If your personality is to overdo things, then there's really no limit to the time you can dump into the project because there aren't any guardrails, so to speak. I also loved the writing assignments. Those, however, became tedious towards the end of the class. It was more of the same and you don't really get any feedback from TAs on your designs. You mostly get student feedback, which I thought was often polarized and rarely educational. (I do like the student feedback aspect though - very unique. ) Going back to the project, I felt that getting a high score by any means necessary was the way to get points, then you rationalize your approach with AI language. I tried to use lesson concepts initially and got mediocre results, but I felt that I learned a lot. Then I realized I wasn't playing the same game everyone else was and adopted more productive methods, but less AI-ish, so to speak. So, in the end, I liked the class, but did not love it. Professors are really good. but there is a disconnect between what is taught in video lectures vs the grading. The grading is heavyly based upon the assignments. The lectures only provides a very high level conceptual overview and were little helpful in doing the assignments. Even if you are good in Java or Python, you may still be struggling in doing the assignments.  KBAI is an awesome course, very well organized, the instructors and TAs are really good and supportive. The course work is challenging and pleasant to follow. \nAlthough the course is not very difficult, the workload is high due to the large number of assignments and projects. Be ready to write a lot, I\u2019ve written more than a hundred pages of reports for the projects and assignments. \nI would add that the videos contents are a little detached from the projects, you\u2019ll have to do some effort to connect them. I would like to have more intimately connected projects to work with the subjects given in the videos, but that\u2019s not a big problem. \nFinally, there is an alternative project which is a great way of learning more, but be ready to work much more than those in the regular path. Also, keep in mind that the alternative project is much more open ended and unstructured, meaning that you will have less guidance from instructors and TAs. <b>Projects: </b>This was my first class in the program, so I chose to stick with the regular Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) projects. Prior to this class, I had no experience in Python or visual processing so I chose to implement the verbal method for Project 1. However, I regret going this route and wish I would've jumped into the visual method right away. I found that when I switched to the visual method, I was able to finish coding my project in < 10 hours whereas I spent well over 3x that amount of time trying to account for all the edge cases in the verbal method. \n<br>\n<b> Lectures: </b> The lectures were very interesting in the beginning! However, towards the end, the topics seemed to overlap quite a bit so I started to lose interest in them. \n<br>\n<b> Assignments: </b> The writing assignments were definitely interesting and allowed you to be creative in developing solutions for real-world AI problems. However, a common complaint among the class is that there was a larger focus on well-made diagrams as opposed to technical writing ability. \n<br>\n<b> Exams: </b> The exams also required a large amount of writing (2k words for midterm, 3k words for final) and had ambiguous rubrics, which was frustrating because our responses were largely up to our interpretation of the problems presented. <br>\n<b> Teaching Staff: </b> The teaching staff was great! Professor Goel is pretty active on Piazza, and the head TA (Yan) was generally quick to respond to any questions we had. Grades were consistently returned 2 weeks after submission, with the exception of Project 2 and 3. This was because they included opportunities for \"recovery credit\" in the regular project and also normalized the grades for alternate project with the regular project to keep the class average fair.  As my first class in the program, this was a great way to get started. I coded in java and had decent time with the three projects. The written assignments sometimes felt like they were graded arbitrarily so make sure to stick the grading rubrics and use the keywords to ensure you get credit. It was hard to keep up with the videos especially if you were trying to do the project at the same time. I would recommend this class to others as a first course especially if it is in a normal semester and not summer. If you are comfortable with coding java or python this course will likely be easy for you. If you a beginner in python or java like I was, you will need to take some prep classes or you will be stressed. Great class - fun topic! I took KBAI as my first course in OMSCS and was very impressed with the organization and quality of the course. The interaction with TAs, Professor and fellow students on Piazza was one of the highlights. Much of the course centers around 3 projects that implement an AI agent to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. This semester there was an alternate project offered for projects 2 and 3 for a select number of students that implemented a chatbot. In hindsight I wish I had taken the opportunity. I believe the chatbot project will be offered to more students in future semesters. My only gripe is that we didn't have more project based work that allowed us to implement techniques learned later in the course. The Raven's projects really only implemented techniques learned in the first few weeks. Be prepared for a lot of writing. Also, you can put as much time as you want into this course so it is a little dangerous. The homeworks and projects are very open ended. Really interesting class, a lot of fun. Basically spending a whole class on a puzzle you just want to perfect.  I took this course because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Unfortunately, my optimism might have blinded me. The course left me disappointed. A full semester later, I can probably summarize what I learned in this course in just a few pages. \n\nThe lectures and assignments were structured in a way that reminded me of a 100 level course I took in my undergrad. The lectures were very high level, and the assignments required us to write about vague AI based solutions to known problems without getting into any implementation. The project was fun and challenging, but I didn't need any of the knowledge I learnt from the course. \n\nOverall, take the course if you'll be satisfied with a very basic introduction to AI, or if you want an easy A.  I personally learned a lot in the class as I was new to the field. The TAs and instructors are very supportive. However, I felt opinions about the class depends on expectation from students. Unlike other classes, the structure is a bit different and focusing more on conceptual aspect of AI. For those students expecting to do more hands-on exercises to learn technical aspects of AI then, I can see how people may not be happy with the class. The project is interesting and has great flexibilities to try out many different things. If you decided to implement a few killer solutions, it's also easy to get by and get good grades. Although the class encourages you to try new interesting ideas, I felt the project itself a bit constrained as it doesn't allow much interactions with outside world so much to try a concept we learned in the class. That could be an improvement area. This was my first semester, first course so I can't really compare KBAI to any other OMSCS class. That being said it felt like a well-run class. Professor and TAs are active on Piazza. Good, well-known and communicated structure. Good lectures. Interesting projects. Generous grading. Medium workload, not very difficult. I could not have wished for a better start into the program.\nI will say, however, that there is a lot of writing (in total we had to write 8 essays for a total of about 15.000 words) and reading for peer feedback (24 peer feedbacks in total, 3 for each essay) which means you will read and critique another 120.000 words.\n\nFor me it was perfect to get my writing in shape, get familiar with python which I didn't know before, get familiar with Piazza, T-Square and Peer Feedback in a class that was busy at times but not too bad in total. I recommend taking it. I loved it, but it wasn't perfect. For one, the lectures covered a lot of high-level concepts that weren't even relevant to the projects. The projects, I felt, were certainly interesting, but in most cases you're just reaching for the hacky solution that will get the best score. This isn't necessarily great if the objective is learning about the concepts, and it isn't necessarily fair for those less hacky of us, either. However, Joyner is a champion, and he made this course a joy. TA's are very involved on Piazza and there were a lot of interesting discussions going on. My favorite of OMSCS so far, but like I said, I might give this 5 stars but it isn't perfect. I felt the course was overly slanted towards projects in grading, to be honest. This class is not that hard if you feel reasonably confident with your programming. If you have trouble problem solving with code, this class will be hard for you. The assignments are fun, but a bit repetitive. You have to write a paper each week, I think a small coding example of what was learned would have been more useful.  Very well designed class. The lecture load is reasonable - about 90 minutes per week - but the four projects are fairly open ended and you could sink as much time as you like into them. To get a B in the class, I\u2019d say expect to spend approximately 5 hours per week on the projects. To get an A, I\u2019d say a minimum of 10, but that could vary. In addition, there are 8 written assignments which are fairly straightforward (\u201cIn 500 words, how would you apply technique X to the project\u201d). One thing I have to emphasize is how much work the TAs and instructors are putting into building a community here - it feels a lot like being on campus due to the level and amount of discussion going on.  This is an awesome course. The TA and Prof are amazing and are very informative and you learn a lot. I put 'Somewhat Easy' on the sheet, because it is to me, but I also have a background undergrad in CS, so the programming is not a problem to me. I am also very interested in the topics covered, so I may be more inclined to enjoy the class more. The topics are extremely easy to understand and assignments are graded and returned at a very fast rate. I cannot rate this class high enough. I really hope the same TA and Proff does another course. I will not hesitate to take it.  This class is not that difficult but it is very time consuming. You will definite learn. There are written assignements EVERY WEEK even the weeks that you have a programming assignment which can take a couple of days to code, you have to make a report about your program. So plan for many hours. Other than that I personally love the class and the instructors are some of the best I ever had. They are very passionate for what they do and they do put a lot of work into each lesson, forum post, etc. Take it, you will be in for a ride.  I love this class. The difficulty rating is really because it takes a bit of work and figuring out things. You are designing an agent which you work on throughout the semester. My advice is keep it simple. I would say it is a survey course in that you get an overview of lots of techniques and can choose what you want to do for your agent. Also, on the weeks that a midterm or a project isn't due, you have to write mini papers on how you would apply one of the many techniques to the project. Just be sure to keep up with lectures the best you can, stay involved in the class and don't procrastinate. In the early weeks, I think I spent more time on my agent just because I was a bit unsure but there have been weeks that I spent 5 hours on the class. Some of the lectures are an hour long so I'd dedicate at least 10 hours/week to the class, preferably closer to 15 just in case.  I'm really liking the class and think it's really worth it. It's as demanding as you want it to be, it's pretty flexible. \nEach week you learn new topics, by every Sunday you must write a short essay on how any topic that you have learned so far, can be applied to solve a problem called 'Raven's progressive matrices'. It's pretty flexible because you will learn more topics than what you can write essays for, so it's flexible given that you choose what topic to write on, the essay helps you develop your understanding of the topic. \nThen, every 3 weeks you write an agent (java or python) that actually solves the problem, you can code it however you want it. \nThe midterm was take home, you are given a whole week to complete it, but it can be done in less than a day. \nThere's lots of paths to be taken to further explore what is being learned bu that's up to your motivation and availability. \nAll projects are solo.  Overall I thought this was a good course and I learned ALOT. \n\nProgramming - This courses didn't necessarily require you to have a superb background in programming. I did pretty well despite my lack of programming experience. \n\nProjects/Lectures - The projects were both doable and enjoyable, and although the lectures were somewhat entertaining, I did not think that they were too helpful to complete the projects. \n\nAssignments/Project Reflections/Tests - The assignments were a lot more time-consuming than expected. There is going to be lots of writing for assignments, project reflections, and tests. I personally thought that the grading was very generous overall for all writing assignments. \n\nGrading - Grading was very generous. You basically get an 'A' above mean. IMO, your grade highly correlates with the time you spend on this course. This was my first class in OMSCS, so my review is also affected by how difficult I found balancing full-time work and personal life with this course. I found the class to be difficult. I thought the lectures in the first half of the semester were fantastic. I started liking them less later in the semester, but there were still some that I really enjoyed. I really like how Professor Goel made the classes interactive. <br>\nWhat I found difficult about the course was the projects. The projects build on each other, which is cool if you feel you have a good grasp on the project and a good way to solve it, but if you don't have a good approach at first, you could potentially need to do a lot of refactoring. I have no experience with visual processing and am overwhelmed by the third project as a result. </br>There are a lot of writing assignments, but personally I did not find them so difficult. However, you have a word limit and I think a lot of detail is expected. KBAI was my first course and i must say it is very well prepared, all TA's and professor was very helpful throughout the course. Classes were organized in proper way along with active discussion among your peers. Initially everyone was suppose to do same project but later on students provide an option to work on other project based on their performance in first project. With this class there is lot of writing which consume a lot of time but there is an opportunity to get your writing published if it is unique and innovative. Though there are many concepts taught in the class about AI, but it was very hard to implement the same in practical life. To start with your program its a good course and one can easily learn python which is highly recommended to finish your project, Good Luck!!! I love this course, well-constructed.\nPeer feedback is useful.\nA lot of writing like other reviewers said.\nAll 3 assignments, midterm and final are writings but need to have good understanding of the course materials.\nprojects are not quite related to course materials, requires some work. This is a hard one to rate. If you're looking to learn about AI, this is probably not the class you expect it to be and almost feels more like a psychology class at times. You'll be doing a ton of writing. We had three 1500-word project reflections, three 1000-word assignments, a take-home 2000-word midterm, a take-home 3000-word final, and three Peer Feedbacks to complete for each of those. Coding is limited to your 3 projects, which for most will be focused on writing a program that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (Java or Python with Pillow/NumPy). A small group of students was allowed to pursue Alternative Projects 2 and 3 which focused on writing a FAQ-based chatbot (Python/NLTK). The lectures were well-made, but cover very high level topics. There really isn't anything that helps you synthesize the course concepts. The RPM project only vaguely relates, depending on your approach, and the assignments and exams make it easy to cherry-pick through the lectures to get your answers, which are often somewhat subjective anyway. The course is very generously curved with anything over the class mean being an A, so it's an easy course overall. The instructor/TA interaction on Piazza is great and I was glad to see Dr Goel engaging with students at least a few times each week, even while traveling. We had a nice community going on Slack, too, which helped build camaraderie and made it fun to participate. Peer Feedbacks were very hit and miss and probably should have been scrapped entirely for the Final Exam. Peer grading didn't affect anything, but led to morale drops when getting overly-negative feedback and a lot of confusion when asked to grade another student without knowing the correct answer. Overall, it's a fine class. It's front-loaded, smoothly-run, and generally fun, but you're not likely to come out of it with many new skills that can be directly applied to anything. As with most courses, though, it's what you make of it. This is one of the best courses in this program. It is very well organized, and the professors are probably two of the best in the program. Throughout the course, you will build an AI agent which can solve puzzles used in measuring IQ. You are given the option of using either Python or Java; I advise that you stick with Python, and this is coming from someone who has expert knowledge in Java. You will be writing a ton of reports in this course, with diagrams and all, and you will spend lots of hours coding. Grades are curved at the end, and the professor reiterates that he wants you to learn and not worry about what grade you are going to get. The midterm and final are both take home, but be prepared to put about 20 hours into completing each. The lectures were thought by Dr. Goel, but the primary instructor was David Joyner. These notes are copy & pasted from the Piazza forum of the course. \n\nI did not like this course very much. Disliked the flow of the lectures, had a hard time following what Dr. Goel tried to explain and could not relate lecture content to the projects really. Has been the most frustrating class so far in my curriculum. I really liked the organization and effort that went into the interactive exercises, the overall communication, grading and the friendly frequent contact. David's been a great instructor. \n\nThe whole educational strategy of this course is brilliant. I would love seeing it applied to other courses. \n\nI can appreciate how the KBAI class falls into the \"academic-style thought\" bucket. I admit, I might have approached the class from a wrong angle, even though it said so right on the labelling. \n\nBut then I doubt the validity of your airplane analogy. Of course the airplane project would not touch upon every subject, but conversely the lectures should instruct how to actually design such a plane. Or at least point to the right resources, tutorials or books. I just thought it would not hurt to slide in a lecture or two that examines the design and implementation of a couple of cool and interesting classic or modern AI agents (maybe a simple one right in the first week to illustrate what we're talking about, a more complex one in the middle and an advanced one at the end). I would argue it would strengthen the understanding of the high level concepts being thought.  The organization of the course is the only thing good about it. The instructors and TAs are readily available and fairly well coordinated. \n\nUnfortunately, the content of the course itself is terrible. The majority of the lesson content is a blatant ripoff of basic CS101 material renamed to make it sound like 'AI' (they explain the 'similarity' by noting that object oriented programming and AI theory were developed at the same time... this is NOT actual AI theory). The content that is there uses trivial examples, with significant hand-waving (ignore the man behind the curtain) of anything that would require them to actually have detail. \n\nThe course projects (building a program that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices) which make up the majority of your grade have absolutely nothing to do with the course material. \n\nTIP: Use the two methods from Agent 3 in this paper to do you projects if you take the class, you'll save yourself a ton of headaches. \nhttp://www. davidjoyner. net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JoynerBedwellGrahamLemmonMartinezGoel-ICCC2015-Distribution. pdf\n\nThe various papers (3 1000 word assignments, 3 1500 word project reflections, a 2000 word midterm, and a 3000 word final) will consume most of your time. All of the papers will involve you trying to shove a square peg into a round hole (trying to coerce lecture topics into a paper that they have no business being used in) just to satisfy the grading rubric. \n\nGrading is fairly lenient, but make no mistake, the class itself is worthless. Think about this course - where are you going to apply this learning. The entire course runs around solving Raven's progressive matrices using one software program. What practical insight does it give you besides learning Python Pillow library to scan images and using your own software development approach to do math and compare the images, find similarity and differences. I did find any value from AI or ML perspective in this course. TA's are okay, sometimes their responses are vague, sometimes okay. They like lots of writing on out of the world scenarios. More diagrams, more flow charts and spend lot of time writing and making nice drawings. \n\nThere is a big disconnect between theory being taught and what you are expected to do in assignments. Videos are nowhere connected to assignments. overall not a very useful course if you want to utilize the knowledge in any of the practical scenario. This was my third course in the program. Overall, KBAI is well run compared to my previous two courses and the TAs were second to none in terms of responsiveness, interaction and timely grading. The good of this course is that the professor is passionate, the TAs are active, and the course is well organized with pace and material being just challenging enough without completely pushing students over the ledge. The grading is fair and peer feedback proved to be very helpful.\n\nThe bad of this course is that the projects build upon each other with minimal help when initially trying to implement a solution. Only a half of the lecture videos are relevant to the course. There is a ton of writing and research involved in this course. \n\nNote that all of the negatives I spoke about above could also be seen as positives. This is purely dependent on the student. I had never programmed with python before this course, so perhaps this would have improved my overall experience since I was hamstrung at times learning Python and the NumPy and PIL library. Overall, a challenging course and the best I've taken in the program so far. It might be the reason why I got frustrated with ML the next semester. So much writing with this class that I made up for the lack of it in ML by dropping the course and writing a 50k word book. \n\nIn all seriousness though, this course was exemplary for interaction for student-student and student-teaching staff. I liked the peer review, even when it was a slog, because it helped me to see the range of students in the course and not just from the snippets of conversation on Piazza. Also requiring this interaction felt like we were doing something, rather than just posting problems to Piazza.  Like several of the other reviews I've read, I have similar feelings regarding the lecture material vs. the projects. \n\nThe largest portion of the grade comes from the projects which require solving Raven's Progressive Matrices problems. I found the projects to be pretty entertaining, and they definitely helped me hone my basic image manipulation and Python skills, but the knowledge required to solve the problems was almost completely independent of anything learned in the lectures. That being said, the lectures were fairly interesting, but they also seemed to be taught at a pretty high-level. I feel like I came out of this class with a slightly better general understanding of what they were trying to teach, but I have no idea how I would apply any of it. That being said, the production value of the lectures was great, in my opinion. They were easy to follow along with, and the little exercises kept me engaged (this is my first OMSCS class, so perhaps this is the same for the other classes as well - I don't have a comparison). \n\nThe assignments and exams were all written papers, which is fine with me. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either. I feel that was appropriate for the material in this course. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you're interested in AI, specifically relating to human thought. The TAs and professors were exceptional (Ashok is a great instructor who clearly has a passion for this subject). However, the slighly disjointed structure of learned material vs. the application of that material left a bit to be desired. It was all very interesting content to me, but it felt a bit shallow. \n\nI selected 6 hrs/week as an estimated average. Some weeks were heavier than others, and then there were weeks when I didn't really do much at all. The course was pretty easy, in my opinion. This course is good in general, but definitely they have to change the main project, which is solving RPMs. You can hack it with 2 or 3 out of 20 methods that you learn in class. Even without watching the lectures, you can get a good score on the project. You only need to watch the videos to do the essays (exams were essays too btw). I feel like a pariah, because I wasn't very impressed with this course. I appreciate the work that went into making it and the support from staff is unparalleled in the program, but the lectures didn't go into any kind of detail, and there wasn't any real discussion on the performance of the topics presented. Overall, I left the class without any confidence that I could actually apply anything outside of the class. The written assignments were worthless because the feedback was trivial, the readings were overwhelming, and the project was neat but ultimately felt pointless because the code was basically a one-off script that wouldn't have much value to any other problem domain. In the end it was demoralizing because I was surrounded by folks who absolutely loved the class, and I just couldn't drink the kool-aid. It's not a bad choice as an elective class, but I can't promise you'll really learn anything. This class is fun because of many different reasons, but mainly because of great support that the professor and TA David provide. They are absolutely brilliant at their job. One can learn a lot from them. Additionally, lecture video's are very good, topics are covered in depth, and references are given wherever required. So, if someone's interested in KBAI, or AI in general, he should definitely take this.  This class is fantiastic. The programing assignments do take some work, but they aren't impossible.  I want to start with the positives. Some of the lectures in the course really *are* interesting. I especially liked the topics of incremental concept learning, common-sense reasoning, diagnosis, and some of the videos on biology-inspired design. I also think that while writing all of those papers does get a bit old, it lets you think creatively and try to apply the topics which were learned in lectures. The experience ends up being a bit shallow since you are writing a single paper on something and then moving on, but I guess it is hard to expect more from a course that covers so many topics. The do provide a ton of extra material for you to go read on your own, and some people do that extra work and seem like they get much more out of the class if you are willing to put in the effort. \n\nA lot of the negative comments others make about this course are definitely valid. Some of the lecture material is just not deep enough, and I find myself tuning it out. This is my 6th course in the program, and I haven't had that problem very often. In addition, the three-part Ravens Matrices project gets old. I also feel like the \"no image processing experience is required\" is technically true, but I feel it would be awfully useful to have that experience. But the biggest problem with the projects is that it is hard to apply what was learned in the lectures beyond the first couple of lessons. I don't think this is specific to the problem being solved, but it is the nature of the requirements and the amount of time you have. \n\nOn a final optimistic note, I think that the alternative project 3 that was proposed is much more suitable for the course and its content. I hope they continue to have a Ravens Matrices project in the beginning of the course, but move on to the conversation agent for the second two projects. I think this would line up nicely with the ordering of lectures. \n\nIn the end I'd say I liked this class, but it was far from my favorite. This has been a very rewarding class, and I highly recommend it. I agree with other posters that the time commitment varies quite a bit with ~25 hours on project weeks and 5-10 hours on weeks with papers due. \n\nAlthough you don't need any advanced image processing techniques, it would definitely help if you are already familiar with NumPy/Python and what you can achieve with it. I think taking CV and CP last semester really helped me. \n\nThe Piazza forum is very active, and there is constantly a good sharing of ideas and approaches. Make sure you make good use of this resource. \n\n I paired this class with ML4T, and that has turned out very manageable. KBAI is very front-loaded if you take the visual only approach immediately in the projects, and ML4T is very back-loaded so I've been able to mostly focus on one class or the other without many conflicts. Best designed class I've ever taken, undergraduate or graduate. Lessons are incredibly well done with banter between Ashok and David, Piazza is RIDICULOUSLY active, assignments are relatively short and can be completed in 4-6 hours, but happen every week. Keeping up with the material is key. The projects are challenging, but the grading is sufficient that deliberate effort over 2-3 weeks, 5-8 hours a time, is enough to get an A or B, assuming you are already thoroughly competent in Python or Java.  I have somewhat of a differing opinion of the previous answers. At first, I thought the class was really cool. You learn how to write a program that models human intelligence. You learn many different concepts of knowledge representation, problem solving, and machine learning. In the first project, you learn how to write a program to solve basic IQ test style questions. However, there are 4 projects in the class, and each project is just the same project, just with harder IQ questions. Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you're even somewhat busy, you're just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I've never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week. The amount of writing isn't much, but as someone who has gotten used to writing only for project reports, it really sucks.  This class was too high level for me. I expected more concrete details and being assigned tasks that required applying the topics learned in class for the projects. The examples in the lectures were so contrived and just kinda weird that I didn't feel interested to explore the readings or any other resources in more detail. \n\nThe projects were all about solving Raven's Progressive Matrices which got really repetitive. In the end, I felt like I was trying different hacks to solve the problem, without actually using any KBAI topics. There was also a lot of writing, which didn't really help my understand of the subject. \n\nThey did try something new with alternate projects this semester (building a chat bot), but the project was too open-ended and was not defined well enough for me to attempt. Perhaps this will improve in future semesters. Knowledge Base is the key phrase for this class. The emphasis is how to identify, use, retain and re-use knowledge from the real world. This class taught me about data structures other than the standard collections, arrays, b-tree and linked-list methods for storing and cataloging information. Prof. Goel and David Joiner are exceptional instructors and the material is well presented. The TAs were also very good and active in the Piazza forums. The only negatives are the assignments and projects got to be a little boring because even though you are using different methodologies, you are still solving the same problems over and over throughout the semester. Also, there is a lot of material so the class moves at a quick pace. I would have liked to posted more in the forums but time was a bit of a constraint. I did read a lot of the posts and most were insightful - Piazza definitely adds to the class experience. I highly recommend this class - you will definitely think differently about A. I. and data representations after taking this course.  My favorite course in OMSCS. On the surface it's very easy, and if you wanted to you could get through it with an A with minimal work. But it's like a great puzzle - you don't want to quit at 80% just because 80% = A (as an example). You want to solve the whole thing. If you love puzzles and challenges, this class will make you progressively strive for inventive new ways to solve problems.  The professor and the TA's are by far the most engaged in the whole OMSCS. Great course, great organization. BUT, the assignments are boring, the first 2 projects are very interesting and interesting, the last two are repetitive. The final exam was quite boring too. I started the semester very interested in the subject, I ended it with a total lack of interest for KBAI, and all because of the assignments and projects. I found myself not applying anything I learned in the second half of the semester. Great professor and great TA's.  This was the most fun class I've taken yet in grad school (out of 8 courses). You get what you put into this class, you can either regurgitate the material (and get a decent grade) - or innovate a little and get an excellent grade! The teaching is the best I've seen in the OMCSC program by leaps and bounds - mostly because of the professor/instructor combo of Ashok Goel and David Joyner. One neat thing they do in this class is list and save exceptional submissions. Unlike the above comment, I thought this was a good introductory course for a broad amount of material. I enjoy writing assignments, so I didn't mind that particular aspect of the course. Make sure you know Java or Python (2 or 3) a bit, the projects are intense though have a forgiving curve.  This is a well run class and the instructors and professor are very involved. The syllabus was clearly articulated and it was easy to know what was expected. That said, I feel like I didn't learn that much especially considering the amount of work I put in. Nothing was very difficult, but it was very time consuming. I'd venture that you could put in much less work and still do well. The programming projects are interesting, but become repetitive. As alluded to above, if you have some algorithmic development under your belt, you can do better than average without even thinking about a KBAI algorithm. There was a *ton* of writing for the class. I think I will hit 80 pages of turned in essays/design reports/exams. This semester there were 5 1000 word essays, 4 1500 word design reports, and 2 ~2500 word exams. However, I think you'd be hard pressed to cover the questions in the depth required by the rubric at those lengths; I was usually at least double the suggested length. Mostly these assignments are rehashing lecture material at a high level. I think this course would have been much better had they selected 3-4 topics and gone in depth on each with a tailored project.  A well designed class. If you are ever interested to implement an intelligent agent program, in this class you will do so to solve IQ puzzles. This is my first class in the program. I certainly had alternating moments of a-ha's and banging my head against the wall. The challenge and disconnect is really between attempting to do something great versus maintaining good grade. If you attempt to implement using one of the more advanced techniques, you will likely get a little discouraged on the actual result. Therefore, most people stayed with brute force algorithmatic approach. Warning, if you never had image processing related experience, the visual compoenent will be more involved! Professor Goel and David are amazingly active in PIazza discussion and the TA's are responsive. 1 week turnaround on project/assignment. The final is fair, mostly concepts application and design.  This course is tons of fun. Can't say I have ever had a final/midterm that I enjoyed as much as this class. The assignments/tests are written in such a way to encourage creativity. The projects are challenging like a puzzle. It is not too hard/time consuming. I could finish the normal assignments easily/effectively in an afternoon. The projects took more time, but were not too bad, and there was a lot of reuse between the three projects. However I can see how the projects could get bad if you get overly ambitious (unless you're into to that). \n\nOnly down side is the course is mostly theory. I do not think I learned too many applicable skills. Even so I highly recommend it.  The professor is likeable and the lectures are pleasant to watch. Because of that, I feel bad saying anything negative. But the truth is, I don't feel like I learned much from this course. The lectures are very lightweight and theoretical. It's like reading a popular news article on the topics. Then you jump straight from that to the project, which is \"Design a human level artificial intelligence agent from scratch. \" The project is very interesting, but almost nothing from the lectures translates into designing the actual agent, which will be the bulk of the work for the entire semester.  Best class ever!! Everyone in OMSCS should take this course. This is a very well-structured class. The material is very interesting and presented very clearly, and all course material is available at the outset of the course. There are *3 assignments*, *a 3-stage class project*, and *peer-reviews* for all assignments and project stages.\n\n**Assignments**:The 3 assignments are essentially essays that ask you to leverage class material to either a specific topic or a topic of your choosing (depending on the assignment). You often have a choice between which material you wish to discuss, so as long as you illustrate you understood those topics and provide a reasonable answer to solve the posed problem it's not too difficult. I would recommend using lots of figures, since the word limit can sometimes be tight, so flowcharts, pseudocode and illustrations in general are very helpful. Make sure to answer all rubric questions provided for each assignment.\n\n**Projects**:The class project is broken into 3 stages. The main overall class project is to develop an AI agent that can solve Ravens Progressive Matrices, a standardized test of intelligence. I say main project since they also allow you the option to complete an alternate project for projects 2 and 3, which involves developing an AI agent chatbot that can answer questions based on answers from an FAQ. At each stage, you deal with progressively harder requirements / problem sets, and you will need to also write a project reflection describing your approach, what you learned and how it connects to KBAI topics. Start projects early, so you don't feel overwhelmed trying to rush things last minute. Don't neglect the written reflection too, as it's normally 40-50% of each project, and make sure to again follow the project rubric to make sure you answer all questions on each rubric.\n\n**Exams**:There are 2 take-home examinations, which aren't too difficult. They are essay-based, much like the rest of the course aside from project implementations, and you  have a week to complete each exam.\n\n**Peer Review**:You will also need to complete peer review for all assignments, all 3 project reflections, and the mid-term and final exams. They don't want single sentence sort of peer reviews, so you will have to put a bit of effort into leaving some good feedback here.\n\n**TAs**: TAs and the prof were all very active on Piazza. There were a few grading hiccups towards the end of this semester, but they were rapid in addressing these issues and correcting mistakes where necessary. I believe the prof, Dr. Goel, is stepping down and there will be a new prof so I'm not so sure if the exact structure of the course will be as described above, so take these notes with a grain of salt.\n\n**Prep**: This is a good first class, but if you aren't comfortable with Python or Java then you should get brush up on one of these prior to starting the class. Most people use Python, and if you want to complete the alternate Chatbot project, it is **only Python**.  Prepare for a lot of writing, as in total I wrote about 11-13k words across all assignments, project reflections, and exams. I took this class as one of my two first OMSCS classes, and I thought it was a fabulous introduction to the program. Drs. Goel and Joyner are very serious about the course and very skilled at course management, meaning that you get a clear notion of what you ought to be doing to succeed, and how you are supposed to use the various tools (Piazza, lectures,... ) effectively. It also means that you get great feedback through the peer review system, and timely assignment grades (which was a problem in my other course). They work to stagger due dates and they publish all due dates at or near the beginning of the term (in the initial syllabus, in fact), which makes it possible for you to plan well if you have other classes or major work commitments. \nIn terms of learning, you get out of the class more or less what you put into it. I didn't have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn't necessary to get a decent grade. \nIn terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. \nYou will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it's fine if you think you've forgotten everything). \nIf one of those doesn't hold true for you, expect to put in a bit more time than my estimate.  I echo others in regards to the quality of the course and instructors. Really top notch. Writing essays wasn't so much fun but after the first couple of assigments I realized that the quality matters more than the quantity. Short, well illustrated papers were the theme of the published exemplary assignments. \nStart the projects early. There will be a lot of trial and error. Write unit tests if possible - saves a lot of headache. Use a version control and commit progress regularly. Simpler approaches often work better but if you do try advanced concepts (recommended if you have the time), don't forget to mention it in the report for bonus points.  Yeaaa I'm gonna have a very different opinion here. I absolutely hated this class. I got an A, so it's not sour grapes, but it was an absolute waste of time. I'll list the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to. \n2. Easy A. Projects are not that hard if you're confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort. \n\nCons:\n1. Way too many things. I don't really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain. \n2. Grading is a joke. \n a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. \n b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment 'Good job', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment. \n3. Peer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn't even attempt. \n4. Content is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I'm amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don't mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it's machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class. \n5. Projects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project) This was definitely the best-managed course I've taken thus far and the instructors were very caring. However, I'm less excited about its content than some other reviewers. The class takes you through a ton of interesting topics but doesn't delve deep into them at all. I thought the projects and/or assignments would account for that but there was little connection between the projects and the course material. In fact, if you try to apply many of the lecture concepts to your agent you'll likely spend more time than other students and up with an underperforming agent because they simply aren't a good fit. The projects are fun in of themselves if a bit repetitive. A poll was taken on how much time students spent on the first project and it spanned from 10-50+ hours, with the mean seemingly somewhere in the 20s. It seems that students with deeper algorithmic programming experience found the projects pretty easy, while others struggled monumentally. The assignments are just written essays that involve describing/applying a given technique, kind of like thought exercises, without actually building anything and therefore resulting in a ton of wiggle room. Long story short: I don't feel like I learned much in this course, esp. considering the time commitment.  Enjoyable and challenging course which really gets your mind hooked on AI. You need to be comfortable with either Java or Python to complete the programming projects of which there are four. The final one involves some computer vision/image processing work so be prepared to learn about it on your own if you haven't done such work before. There is also a lot of writing required; eight written assignments, two exams and each programming project has to be accompanied by a design report. The quality of teaching and the TA support was excellent. The workload was substantial but ultimately manageable. Make sufficient time to watch and study the lectures which cover the topics in the text BOOK (AI by Patrick Winston) extensively. Some people took this course together with another one but I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you are able to study full-time. If you start your programming assignments early, you should be able to do well in this course. \n\nTo counter the negative points made elsewhere on this page about having to write an essay every week, I would say that yes there is some writing involved but it's not really that much since they only ask for about 500 words per essay. The purpose of the essays is to give you a chance to think through how you will apply a specific AI technique to the programming assignments and dry-run your ideas in your mind before you start coding.  This has been the most awesome OMSCS course thus far, very challenging with lots of JAVA (or Python) programming. In the first project you'll be pulling your hair off, after that things 'click' and that's when the fun begins. I learned a lot from this course.  I had a blast taking this course and learned a lot. The main focus of the course is a set of related projects that last the length of the course. The projects are open-ended in that you can use any methods you want for them, and the concepts taught in the course are meant to give you ideas to try implementing on your own. There are also assignments in the form of short papers explaining how you might apply a concept from the course to the projects, and take-home exams that similarly require exploring the concepts in-depth. Overall the instructors seem to really care about designing the course to give students the best learning experience possible and encourage creativity. You do not need to have any previous AI experience to take this course, and it's not very math-heavy compared to other AI courses I have taken. You will also have a much easier time on the projects if you are proficient in writing Python or Java code, a lot of the project involves coming up with and trying your own ideas for algorithms so being able to implement a new idea quickly is helpful. If you do end up having a hard time on the projects, the minimum performance for getting a decent grade is very reasonable. Overall if you like thinking creatively, want to study how machines and humans can approach reasoning and enjoy working on projects this is a great course.  The course is really interesting. The assignments I liked a lot, how they were related to the classes. But the projects it seemed to me that lacked the applicability of the concepts learned in class. It is not complicated but the worload is big. This course requires a lot of theory and lots of essay writing. Dr. Goel is amazing as he really does a great job trying to always improve the class. I did not get the pleasure of having David as the TA but I hear he is equally amazing. Dr. Goel makes this an extraordinary class and really keeps one engaged. The head TA we had, Lallith, did a great job as well. There are numerous positives and I want list them all here other than to say that the positives way out weight the negatives. But will here are my two negatives. \nOne, the third project emphasizes the use of visual viewing of the images which you end up focusing on solving the problem visually instead of utilizing any AI techniques you learned in the class. People with a visual programming background have an advantage on project 3 I think. Note it shouldn't affect your grade to much just feel I spent way more time trying to understand visual programming then I did learning to apply AI techniques on project 3. \nTwo, there is alot of writing and essays. Some of the essay questions become fairly hard to apply using the items you learned in class. Alot of the AI techniques overlap and are fairly theoretical. On top of this, it is graded by a random TA. There is no secondary grader and your scores are left to the arbitrary TA who reviews it. On top of this I had in some cases great detail about why I was scored a certain way and then in others it was a single sentence. There is alot of writing and it spreads the TAs pretty thin but would be nice if a second pair of TA eyes could review a paper. Note, I am not complaining of my score they did a pretty good job but just seems a bit arbitrary. \nThe work load is pretty high and can be made higher depending how much detail you want to give. The instructor is down right amazing and enjoys challenging the students and himself. Overall I highly recommend the class and most will do fine as long as real effort is made. Grade is curved.  This was a well designed course, learned a decent amount though didn't go too in-depth into any particular methodology, mainly focuses on giving students a wealth of different reasoning methods to learn and pull from. The projects are good and well-suited for the course. There is more writing than I expected, six ~4-page assignments, three ~8-page project reflections, along with two ~8-page exams. The scheduling of the exams left something to be desired. The weekend after submitting a project worth a good percentage of our grade, we needed to write a long essay as our exam, also worth a good portion of our grade. Made worse one of the exams was due the weekend after Thanksgiving.  This was my first OMSCS class and I enjoyed it. I never did AI during undergrad and felt this was a good intro to AI. This class is well organized and the professor, TA and student participation on Piazza and slack was very good. Lectures were interesting, expect to spend more time on projects and write-ups. This is a fun class with a very active professor (Ashok Goel). However, some of the material is covered at a superficial level only (no implementable algorithms) and the project can be very demanding. But overall, it was a nice course.  It was okay, but David Joyner was awesome. The content is a little light, compared to other courses, but you learn a decent amount. It probably would be best to take this before ML or AI, although it probably won't prepare you much for those. Workload varied between project time (3-4 weeks) and the writing weeks (1 week). \nBe prepared to dedicate ~2 hours a week to watching lectures. \n\nThere is a ton of writing in this course. You have to write a paper for everything. 3 assignments, 3 projects, midterm, and a final. All include writing a paper, so be prepared to write. Seriously. You will write ~13, 000 words throughout this course. \n\nThe projects all revolve around solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices. It was pretty repetitive, but I learned a lot while doing it (by reading papers and trying out different theories. ) I don't recommend doing the verbal approach and just starting with the visual. There are plenty of resources out there on getting up to speed with it. It's worth overcoming that burden sooner rather than later. \n\nThe lectures are pretty high level and they only apply for the writing assignments. \nOverall this is a theoretical course so there aren't a lot of hard lines for anything. It leaves a lot in the open for you to think and go your own way. This can be frustrating for some people as students in general like hard lines as it gives us something to measure against. \n\nThere were parts of this class I didn't like, but overall it was a solid class. The rubric is very structured and they are timely with releasing grades. This was a truly exceptional class! The professor is absolutely in love with the material and very engaging. TAs kept Piazza tidy and helpful and were reasonably available. The material is interesting by itself and the course project (which, at time of writing, occurs over three installments which build on each other) is very fun and challenging. The midterm and final exam were remarkably creative and enjoyable. The smaller writing assignments were also fun and engaging. If you want to get a lot from this class (and there's a ton to get), take it by itself or with a light class so that you can spend a lot of time delving into and working with the material. Also, don't get hung up on the word-count suggestions in the writing - just write a cohesive answer to the given question(s) and you'll be fine. \n\nIf you don't have a strong (if any) background in code, this is probably not a terrific course to start with (look into SDP as a refresher/starter course), though some classmates reported little-to-no prior experience and came out fine in the end - just be prepared to dedicate several hours outside of class to developing your software skills and get into a study group with other students who can mentor you.  Good concept for a class, but the lectures have almost nothing to do with the projects. The projects are different variations of the same project. There is no code feedback, so you'll have a much easier time if you're already proficient in the language you use. Similarly, if you struggle with the first or second project, you're in trouble because they keep building on the previous and they become harder. Many had to completely start from scratch which can be frustrating. \n\nThere's a lot of writing to be done between assignments/projects/exams and at some point it starts to feel like a lot of bsing. The class has great potential, but lacks a bit in execution. This is one of those classes that seems to have a very divided opinion.  I\u2019m in the class-is-a-gigantic-waste-of-time camp. I appreciate the enthusiasm of the professor.  That\u2019s nice.  But everything about the class felt like a joke to me.  The content of the class is super hand-wavy and not really tied to anything useful (as far as I can tell).  The projects were a little fun at first, but they only use the course content in a superficial way.  For me, the writing was a terrible use of time and energy.  The only thing I learned while writing for this class is how to write against the given rubric.  If you enjoy learning interesting ideas/concepts/techniques and demonstrating your newfound knowledge by building cool things, I would look elsewhere. The content of the course is quite interesting and the video lectures deliver the content well. The written assignments were thought-provoking and the coding projects were challenging at times but doable. Knowing Python definitely gives an advantage. What I liked most about the course was the instructor's and TAs' passion for the content and interest in student learning. There were regular requests for student feedback on the course, and previous feedback seems to have been integrated fairly quickly (giving students the chance to do an alternate project for both projects 2 and 3). This course is very much what you put into it. You can get a B with minimal effort, assuming you are a good programmer, or you can spend 20+ hours a week diving deeper and reviewing the optional readings. I took the course for the enjoyment of it and got a lot out of it. The final exam topic alone was so interesting that I spent several hours researching after my paper was already submitted. The \"Time\" box doesn't let me put in a range, but this course varied for me. Weeks when I wasn't working on the project, ~5-10 hours was enough to keep up. Weeks when I was working on the project, more like 20-25 was required. \n\nThis was a really interesting course. I would rate the lectures and papers A+, moderately challenging while extremely interesting and informative, ie. the perfect class in my opinion. \n\nThe only thing I didn't love about the class is the project. You're given a single challenge and then three attempts to build an AI agent that can handle it. It's the same problem (taking a visual IQ test) each time, but the difficulty is increased as time goes on. \n\nThe first version of the project was interesting and pretty fun. But by the second time I was getting a little tired of it, and now I'm working on v3 and I'm not so excited about it. \n\nThe reason is, I feel the project has devolved into a test of my image processing skills rather than an test of knowledge-based AI programming. I didn't mind that on a single project, but I wish we'd gotten to try something different for p2 and p3 instead of the same thing just harder. \n\nHowever, in the scheme of things, the project isn't too bad and the class remains really fun. The Piazza forum is extremely active, and Dr. Goel is highly responsive and engaging with the students. \n\nThis was my first class in OMSCS and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The first few weeks confirmed all my excitement for this program. I'd highly recommend this course for anyone with an interest in the subject, and also for first-semester students (but take it by itself!). KBAI was my first course in OMSCS, and it was awesome. Until you do KBAI, AI seems magic. After you do KBAI, AI seems algorithmic :). You will know how Watson nailed Jeopardy. \n\nIt is also one of the most time consuming courses with assignments (in plural) literally every week. Then there are 3 projects, which you will do better if you start early. \n\nKBAI is an amazingly organized class - with Instructor and TAs very active in Piazza. Rubric for assignments, projects and exams (they are open book) are well defined, and the feedback (from peers and Instructors) are very qualitative.  Well run class with good discussion and interesting subject matter. I think the writing assignments have helped me understand the lectures better. Regarding the project work, I like the approach as it seems reflective of what you would do if developing a 'real world' agent. I think going from relatively easy to more difficult problems helps to apply additional concepts to solve them and build on the past. \nThis is my 3rd course in the program and ranks as my favorite, in a pretty tight race.  Loved this class. A lot of papers to write but the programming project is very interesting and fun. The summer course was condensed which may have made the amount of work more intense (something large due almost every week) but I learned a lot and I highly recommend this class. As others have, I'd also recommend going with Python over Java.  Very fun projects. Very nice and helpful staff and classmates. Easy and difficult at the same time. Easy because at least half the class is guaranteed an A, so you only have to be average to get an A. Hard if you want to do things properly and solve most or all of the Raven's problems. You get a choice between a visual (image processing) and a verbal (hashlike input processing) agent for the first two projects. If I could do it again, I'd do the projects visually from the get-go. Visual isn't much harder, is way more fun and less annoying, saves you from redoing things later and gives you more time to fine-tune your agent. Also, if it's all the same to you, between Java and Python, pick Python. Those guys seem to get way more useful library methods for image processing than the Java camp.  Prepare yourself to have a lot of writing. Started the projects as soon as possible, don't be comfortable with verbal approach only, try to get to visual approach quickly so you can have to improve your project instead of being overwhelmed from learning image processing ( PIL or AWT) if you don't have experience with these two.  Very time-consuming. Lots of writing, but definitely helpful when organizing thoughts and ideas. Project is very challenging but very rewarding as well. Extremely well-run.  This is defnitely fun and challenging class and well structured one. Its a great experience. Its bit of a work too. You will have to get organized from the very begining. The course concepts are not too difficult. The assignments and final exam is a lot of writing, about 1000-1500 words but its not hard. The projects are little hard to start with but you get to see exemplary projects after each submission and that will help you improve your scripts. The instructors and TA are very helpful. There is a lot of communication between students and teachers which keeps you engaged in the class. There are open discusssions on assignments and projects without giving away any answers and the staff encourages that a lot. The grading is pretty lenient, if you have been performing close to class average you will get an A grade. The point is to never give up and keep working hard.  Extremely well organized and run. Piazza is a huge help! The lectures are easy to understand and most interesting to learn. The assignments and exams require a lot of thinking and writing. We had 3 assignments and 3 projects - something every forthnightly and had peer feedbacks every week. It was time consuming but fun and plenty to learn. Start projects early. The visual approach seemed daunting but turned out quite okay. It's definitely helpful if you had some background of image processing in Java or Python. Note - not all packages are allowed! The class has 3 assignments, 3 projects, and a midterm and final.\n\nThe assignments, midterm and final have no coding at all.\n\nIt's good to know going into it that this class is heavy on writing. In total I wrote _48 pages_ for this class across 8 papers.\n\nThe projects have two parts: coding and writing a reflection paper. The code is focused on creating an agent that can solve the Raven's Progressive Matrices IQ test. Don't be afraid if your agent can't solve all the problems, getting 50-75% of the problems right is usually good enough to get an A. The reflections are about the agent's problem solving process, performance, and relation to human cognition.\n\nGrading is competitive. If you stay above the mean, you get an A. In my semester the mean was ~81%, so 84% was an A. I feel KBAI is a great course to begin OMSCS.  My background is in electrical engineering so my software development skills are limited compared to others working through their OMSCS degree.  This course provides the option to utilize either Python or Java to work through the three projects that build on each other throughout the semester in order to develop an AI agent that is able to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices problems.  I found the material extremely interesting.  It is a bit of a jump for those with limited software development experience translating the theoretical course material and applying it to the projects, but extremely manageable after dedicating the expected amount of time.  Three assignments must also be completed throughout the semester that are 1000-1500 word essays on various topics taught throughout the course.   The midterm and final exams are both take home essays that must be completed within one week and the expected word counts are 2000 and 3000 words respectively.  It is a very well run course and the TA's and professor are extremely active within Piazza. I thought this class was very professionally constructed (the video lectures, etc. ) It covers a wide breadth of KB AI topics, and you go through them fairly quickly. The projects were challenging yet doable. I was really thankful that the instructor provided all of the course slides, notes, past exams on T-Square. I also found the peer feedback system very useful - it was great see other students approaches, and getting comments on your papers. Like others have stated, you have to write quite a bit in this class. Overall this is exactly what I had hoped for in this graduate program - excellent quality and quite challenging.  This course, even after adjustment, has a heavy workload of both writing (a surprising amount of that, actually) and coding. As someone without a formal CS background, I found the coding extremely challenging, especially because the push is always to be perfect - and in this course, that's very difficult to do. That said, my Pythonic prowess is significantly higher after having taken this course, and I was incredibly proud of the progress I made both in knowledge of course material and coding over the duration of the term. This class was wonderful; the lecture material and written assignments dovetailed perfectly, the core concepts were really interesting, and the instructor/TAs were very engaged. I do highly recommend learning some basic image processing (even how to use Pillow functions would help) before coming into the class. This was an incredibly well-structured class, and I enjoyed it tremendously, despite all the hard work.  A bit of a challenge, but very rewarding. I wish there was a bit more variety in the programming assignments, and there is a lot more writing than I expected. One key for all of the writing assignments (including the project reflections) is to include lots of examples and state your assumptions. \n\nTA's and professor are all very involved and want to interact with students, which makes the course more enjoyable.  I'm in the camp of dissatisfied people. Be aware that this is not an AI course, this is rather an introductory knowledge-representation course. The course is not hard and you can make it fun but it is up to you. \nThe lectures are mere overview of the topics, my undergrad AI course gave me much deeper knowledge on AI. You're on your own discovering the topics; lots of readings are presented so you can dig deeper if you'd like. Which is nice. But I would go as far as don't even waste your time watching lectures if the title sounds familiar to you - for example there is a lecture on classification but it does not go into any mathematical or implementation detail whatsoever. If you've taken an AI, ML or CV class before (or you've read a few pages on wikipedia about statistical classification), you already know more than it is presented in the class. \nWritten assignment are fine, they are short and as the class doesn't, neither are you required to go into technical details. The grading of the papers is a bit of a lottery, depends a lot on the reviewer. I got points taken away for totally contradicting reasons between two assignments. \nThe coding homework is fun but barely has anything to do with the class materials. Turns out you better off implementing stuff on your own (hardcoding lots of stuff) and later claim that this for cycle is 'learning by recording cases' and those if conditionals are 'decision trees' or whatever. \nSo all in all interesting ideas are presented, coding can be fun (but time consuming if you're not good at Python), the papers are not hard and grading is generous but there is no connection between these. Requirements are not always clear and you never really know where you at performance-wise which caused frustration for some. You can easily get a B or A in this class with very small effort - papers can be done in an hour or two, you can skim through videos quickly and the 3 programming assignments can be done during a weekend. Rest of it is up to you.  1. Be prepared to write. (Images/Charts and obviously making sense gets you good grades)\n2. Python (numpy/pillow) libraries are your lifeline. If you have used them life can become easy. \n3. RPM problem's can be daunting and you may eventually get overwhelmed. Nonetheless, a really interesting course. \n4. Professor Ashok and TA's are really active in Piazza. \n\nReally enjoyed it. I liked the class. I felt a little bit tired at the end of been working on the same problem (i. e. Ravens Progressive Matrices RPM) for the projects. \n\n* Writing\nThere is substantial amount of writing as for every project you write a reflection. Assignments are also writing. \n* Projects\nAll projects were solving RPMs with increasing complexity. Very little could be used from the class material to solve the project. The biggest challenge in the projects is the computer vision part of it where you need to interpret images to detect analogies between them. \n* Exams\nAll writing as well. This is where you can put to practice the material learned in class. But of course, it's all theoretical. This is my second OMSCS course. This course focuses on the process of human cognition and methodologies to design artificial intelligence to imitate human cognition. This course addressing the topic of artificial intelligence from a methodological standpoint rather than discussing the algorithms and frameworks for implementations. It is important to set your expectation straight before jumping into this course. David Joyner is an exceptionally good teacher. GATech is lucky to have him. \n\nThough solving the Raven's Progressive Matrices in course project is fun, I have to say this course is pedagogically flawed. First, in the project work, you never really got the opportunity to implement the learnt methods. The problems are getting more and more difficult as the course progress, the absolute majority of the course participates (including myself) has to code more and more complex and specific rule sets, which is tedious and boring. Instead of solving more complex problems, I would be happier to stay with simpler ones but try more advanced methods, e. g. , learning by correcting mistakes, version space, to build my agent with learning capabilities. There are reviews saying you do not have to watch the course video to be able to work with the project, which is true to some extent. Second, the assignments are the worst part of the course. For example, you are asked to design a self-driving agent using one of the method discussed in the lecture in 1000 words and one of the grading rubric is on the feasibility of the proposed solution. Self-driving car is not even in mass production, how can we describe a feasible proposal in 1000 words? The most funny part is the TA's feedback, which goes like: How well does the assignment describe the problem it is attempting to solve?: 5 \u2026. Though I got really good grades, I am very sure that I learned nothing from the assignments. I was really close to quit this course after reading the TA's feedback to my first assignment.  Couldn't wait for the class to end. If you love to write then this class is for you! There is a writing assignment almost every week and it regurgitates the same topic for some. When you're not writing you're working on your project. Oh, you also have a write up for that. Don't believe if anyone says that you only need to do the minimum amount for the papers. The students that are held in high regard for assignments turn in 2x to 3x what is required and everyone else is held to that standard. Th project is ongoing and does not really offer any opportunity to develop meaningful AI algorithms that you learn in class. There is hardly anytime to write a great AI agent because you spend so much time writing. That's what I really couldn't stand about the class, too much talking about theory and not enough time spent on actually implementing the ideas. I'm sure there are students that will argue my experience, but I want to actually program to see what they are talking about actually works in the real world. I felt the lectures were too high level and the examples were at the grade school level. So it was really difficult to find value in the lectures. This is not a critique against the professor and the TA's they are great! It just that the material could have been presented better. If you're looking to learn some cool AI techniques, you're not going to find them here. This class is really an intro to cognitive AI, nothing more. It is broad sweeping with no real substance.  This class is definitely fun. You get to build an AI Agent to solve some IQ problems. I thought the IQ problems solving was to be done theoretically only when I skimmed through the syllabus. Turn out the agent (written in Python or Java, your choice) really runs and you are given grades based on the number of correct answers.  Well this class is fun. Building an agent is great. i am super tired taking this class with work. this is my first OMSCS class so i dont have any reference to other classes. But there are lots of essays. I took the class because it looks like lots of programming. It is lots of programming but also lots of essay. you have to write an essay every week I took this class already expecting lots of writing assignment based on the review. And that is exactly what I got. You will have 3 assignment write-ups, 3 project reflections and 2 exam essays. Each assignment will have 3 peer feedback so 24 peer feedback in total. That is a lot of writings but dont get me wrong, you will learn much of the concept through all of these. \n\nLectures are good and well prepared but mostly only concepts. You need to take extra steps to convert it into working code. I chose RPM project since it had more guidance and stable grading criteria. But if the chatbot assignment is improved in the future, YOU SHOULD TAKE IT! It is more valuable, used in the industry, and looks impressive in your portfolio (compared to RPM solver..). Piazza and Slack were active and really helpful.\n\nOverall a good survey course to KBAI concepts but expect to spend 20-30 hours a week for the assignments. Lots of high level concepts were taught. We apply these concepts to problems within writing assignments. We only implement maybe one or two concepts in the projects. These assignments and projects were a bit frustrating to me because 1) there is a lot of writing involved and I struggle with writing. Heck, I haven't written so much as I did in when I got my undergraduate's degree. 2) We don't get to implement more of the concepts we learn and are stuck working with similar material for all three projects. 3) Grading seems to be inconsistent with graders and many times they don't provide feedback about why they knocked points off. I did, however, enjoy the professor and TA's enthusiasm to respond to our questions and provide statistics to graded work and that sort of thing. I also was happy to see many individuals participating in the Piazza forums, creating interesting discussions about KBAI in general. I'd recommend this course to be taken in the beginning of your OMSCS journey since it is a very smoothly run course (there were some hiccups, but nothing big), and you get to practice your java or python skills! This is a very well run course. The TAs and the prof are always active on Piazza ready to help. We had regular office hours meet twice a week up until the last project. Even though there was a disconnect between the RPM projects and the course contents, the 3 RPM projects itself was very interesting and thought provoking. There is a Alt project after the first mandatory RPM project that deals with chat bot which I believe is more relevant than RPMs. Expect lots of writing in this class. I struggled with the writing assignments in the beginning but managed through later as I adjusted to the rhythm. In all there are 3 writing assignments, 3 projects with the project reflection associated with them, a mid term and a final exam. If you hate writing, this class may not be for you. Projects can use Python or Java. I would recommend brushing up your Python skills, especially Pillow and numpy for RPMs and NLTK for chat bot. This is a great first course to take and will set you up for the rest of your OMSCS journey. Good Luck!!! If you've seen the Walking Dead, 7th season -- \"Easy Street\". That sums this class up\n\nI wanted to like this class... I really did. But if I see another Raven's Progressive Matrix I'm gonna explode. \n\nThe projects basically don't follow the lectures... and my god do they get boring. The whole semester is devoted to just solving RPMs. Solving these basically comes down to using some voodoo image analysis that doesn't correlate to anything in the lectures. You could solve them by doing shape extraction and building a semantic network... but they don't allow OpenCV for the shape recognition. I really don't understand that -- leave that as an exercise for CV or CP, not KBAI. \n\nThe writing isn't really that bad... but for each project you write yet ANOTHER reflection on solving RPMs. AND the final exam is about solving RPMs. Enjoyed the course. Learnt the theory behind AI agents. The overall structure in developing the agent from one level to another was really interesting. Don't miss the lectures since you will learn the lot of terminologies and concepts in designing an agent.  The material is easy enough to understand and given a 'full length' semester, this class would be much more enjoyable. I took it in the Summer Semester and it was definitely 'jam packed', requiring my full-time attention. I would recommend the class during either the normal Fall or Winter schedules, but not during the reduced timeframe Summer schedule. My '30 hours per week' would probably be less had the course been spread over the normal amount of time. \n\nI would seriously recommend either taking the CP or CV class before taking this class or have a decent amount of experience using Python's PIL image module. Without this background, you'll be at a disadvantage with the projects. I spent a lot of time learning image processing and went down a lot of dead-ends on my projects because I wasn't prepared for the visual processing aspect of the projects. IMHO, taking CP or CV should be a prerequisite of the class, or at least strongly encouraged. \n\nDavid Joyner is an excellent and enthusiastic teacher, unlike some in this program who seem totally 'checked-out'. He actively participates in the forums and discussions and adds a lot to the educational experience.  Very engaging course with really good interactive lectures. It's important to build a good foundation from your first assignment and limit having to completely re-factor your project code. There were also a few additional assignments that were a bit time consuming, but helped to reinforce the material.  This is my 7th OMSCS course and, overall, this is a decent class. I'm glad I took it over the summer as the pacing and workload fit the compressed summer schedule well. While I didn't find coursework to be all that challenging, it was time consuming. Dr. Joyner does a wonderful job of managing the class and communicating via Piazza. The lectures are informative and thought-provoking, but there's not a whole lot of depth. Perhaps the suggested readings were intended to supply the depth, but I didn't find them necessary for success in the course. Similar to what a few other reviewers have posted, my biggest complaint about this course was that I didn't feel like I applied the lecture topics to the projects. I'm fairly confident I would have implemented my agent in the exact same way without having watched any of the lectures.  This class was not extremely challenging, but it was a lot of fun and I learned a great deal. Dr. Goel was a great instructor and our TA, David Joyner, were absolutely wonderful and very responsive on the forums. The projects were of very reasonable difficulty while still providing many learning opportunities.  This is my first semester so I've only got one other class to compare to, but KBAI is amazing. \nThe projects are incredibly interesting, as are the readings (mostly... The stefik book is tedious, but there's only 3 readings). \nProf. Goel and David are great presenters in the video lectures - and they are both very responsive and helpful on the Piazza forums. \nKBAI is also extremely well-organized compared to my other class. \nProctorU was not used, which is always a plus.  Pedagogically, this is one of the finest courses I've ever taken. The professor and TA's (real and robotic) are fabulous, the organization and tooling is first rate. But the overall experience is a mixed bag. There's an awful lot of high-level hand-wavy abstract AI concepts that I am certain I will never use again. On the other hand, there very challenging projects solving these Raven's Progressive Matrices that you may, barely, use one hundredth of one of the course concepts but probably will just use math. It's a great course, but I wish it were more filling. \n\nLots of essays. If you can write well, you will dominate this course. New for Fall 2016 is an optional alternative final project based on the Alexa challenge -- the kind of innovations the professor brings to the course. I just wish the level of the course were more relevant to... life? One of the courses with the most genuinely involved instructors. They are actually around all the time and are still experimenting with and improving the course even though this is one of the oldest courses in the program. Professor Goel is going to stop teaching this course starting next semester, but it will still be taught by Professor Joyner (and Bobbie Eicher), so you can still expect a lot of instructor involvement. The course does open book exams without proctortrack, which is personally my favorite mode of doing exams since proctortrack is so constraining. Decent amount of freedom to explore and experiment in the assignments if that's what you want to do.\n\nMy main issue (and it is a big one) is that the material itself feels pretty dated: knowledge-based AI isn't really in fashion in our age of ML and deep learning, so I took this course to see if there was still interesting techniques in that domain, and frankly I don't think I've been convinced: there is *a lot* of material in this course, but much of it seems obvious, brittle, or excessively vague. Also there seems to be a lot of repetition in the material, where techniques that are extremely similar get presented separately due to what I think are very minor differences.\n\nIn summary: this is a well-taught course. It does require you to write a lot but you don't need to be a genius to get an A, just do your work consistently. However, don't expect your mind to be blown by the material, and be aware that you are learning about an area of AI that is now fairly outdated. This was a well-run course and if you are at all interested in AI it is a must-take. Grading of written assignments seemed somewhat arbitrary but the curve is generous; it would be very difficult not to earn at least a B if you do all the assignments. The projects aren't terribly difficult and I actually found them to be a lot of fun. One thing I really enjoyed is that when I did the projects I could see the progress I was making in the form of the number of questions my agent was getting correct.  This class can be fun to tinker with, but ultimately I don't think I learned anything useful in this class. \n\nThe professor and TAs were incredible. They are very engaged, obviously passionate about the class, and ran a very smooth ship. But, this class was too much fluff for my taste. I remember when I was in undergrad, there were different versions of physics classes of varying difficulty for different majors. The easiest version was for humanity majors, which was mostly high-level and conceptual, and was dubbed \"physics for poets\". I felt this class was \"AI for poets\". But, it seems a lot of students don't share my sentiment and loved this class. I suspect those from a more math heavy background might find this class boring. \n\nThe class is pretty easy and is a good candidate to pair with a harder class. Because there is a good deal of writing, I suspsect students who don't speak English as a first language may struggle a little more with this aspect.  This course is very high level and abstract. You need to write about 'vaporware' to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts. Written Assignments 20%, Written Final 20%, Written Peer Feedback 15%. Projects coding 27%, written project reflection 18%. You can see that 73% of your grades are based on writing. The course material are not very difficult, but since they are so abstract it's hard to articulate. You need to spend a lot of time 'thinking' about what to write. This course is time consuming (compare to ios, aos and ai robotic), especially in the summer. But from what I heard ML is even more so. Conclusion: if you have no problem writing about abstract topics and apply high level ideas to your written assignments, then you will love it. If you want concrete homework (programming, math, calcuation) then you might hate it. You have work due almost every week.  As mentioned above, this class is very abstract. I had a lot of fun building and agent and even writing about and discussing KBAI concepts. But it is time-consuming. My least favorite part is the video lectures. I have some background in Neuroscience and math, so the lectures lacked depth compared to what I already know about the topics in this course. David is by far the biggest asset this course has. He's a great instructor and is very focused on helping as many students succeed as possible. That being said, your success is depending upon your own creativity and work ethic. If you're not yielding good results and get stuck, bring up a discussion on Piazza to ask for help.  If you integrate all the comments above, I think you'll have a fairly accurate view of the course. The main negatives for some people were the amount of writing required (which I actually liked), the relative shallowness of topic coverage in the lectures, and the disconnect between lecture material and the projects. For me those were greatly outweighed by the interesting material, the fun of the projects, and the teaching ability of the instructors. I was enormously impressed by the responsive and productive communication between everyone, instructors and students alike. This was my 7th OMSCS course, and it felt more like a community than any other I've taken (the runner-up was 6475 last semester). The piazza forums are always active and helpful, and I enjoyed the small but chatty hipchat group. A few people complained about all the peer feedback, but I thought it was great to see what others were doing and to get feedback on my own work.  The projects were a lot of fun. It does require a pretty a basic understanding of programming. Do not worry about lack of knowedge about image manipulation. I had zero experience with dealing with images and I did pretty well. The essays suck, its writing about how you would design a program to solve some problem. Very abstract and it was hard for me to go into details. The video lectures are interesting but very high level. I would have liked to see greater depth. The projects was where it was at as it was the most enjoyable (and most time consuming). You can write your programs in either Java or Python. Go with Python, even if you have zero experience in Python and lots of experience in Java. Python is an easy language to pick up and the image manipulation library you have access to blows Java out of the water. Extremely fun class, even if its a lot of work. Highly recommend Pros:\n- course are well organised and contents are understandable\n- TAs and Profs are very responsive\n\nCons:\n- The concepts taught here might be too generic, it feels like the same contents are being repeated again and again in different terms\n- Tons of writing involved in this class, think about taking this class twice if you are not good at writing essays\n- The grading of writing assignments are largely based on the diagrams you draw. Yes, we do agree diagrams will help illustrate the ideas, but it shouldn't play such a large part in grading\n- The Projects are about solving RPM problems by building an AI Agent, it sounds like a real AI project, however from my personal experience, it feels like a normal programming assignment, the `Intelligence` part is not that much...\n\nFinal Exam Drama:\n- So the prof posted final exam paper, which is a writing assignment. After three days when many people have finished the paper, they found out that the solution to one question (Q3) is available online. They took that question done and posted another version of final exam paper, many people's efforts in that question are now in void.\n- The worst part occurred in grading Q2, Q2 is a perfect example to be solved using version space as per discussed in lecture videos, it could be solved using Incremental learning concept as well, they are largely interchangeable and there is no absolutely right or wrong. Students who use version spaces concept didn't get much credit, when being questioned, the prof's response is like below\n\n```\nBriefly, the original final examination contained a specific question on version spaces using the same data as for Q1 and Q2 in the current final exam. Given that we had a question on version spaces in the original final exam, it was clear that Q2 referred to Winston's method of incremental concept learning (and not version spaces).\n```\n- So the grading principle is, because the original problem Q3 is using version spaces, thus Q2 cannot use version spaces concept. That is indeed ridiculous as Q2 and Q3 are not related, and students taking the exam shouldn't guess which concept to use based on a question that has been deleted from the paper! *Disappointed and cannot understand what they are thinking.* This was my first class in the OMSCS program. I thought that the lectures were fleshed out really well in a way that was easy for me to understand. Taking this by itself is pretty manageable and mainly only gets busy around the the due dates of projects and exams. Take note that you will be doing a lot of writing and self-reflection for this class. Every single assignment, project, and exam will consist of a decent amount of writing. I would recommend this class for any new OMSCS student. The TA and professor are the most involved of any OMSCS course I have taken so far (well, maybe 8802 self-driving car comes close). They really fostor a great collaborative atmosphere in the forums, which is a striking difference to CS6290. The lectures are all entertaining, but there is a lot of material that they cover. There was more writing in this class than I have had in other classes, but its been okay. The projects are open-ended and you can spend as much time as you want on them. I usually got my projects to a point where I could turn them and get a decent grade very quickly, but then spend a lot of time improving them afterwards to try to solve more problems. The take-home midterm (haven't taken the final yet... ) was actually quite time consuming but was really interesting.  This is the class to take if you want to get a headstart in AI. The support and engagement has been phenomenal. Projects(4 in total) are open ended and you end up learning a lot. The class also has 8 essays(~500 words) and two exams and asks you to apply the concepts you have learnt in the class. Overall, a fun class and one must opt for this class.  If you have basic knowledge of AI and feel comfortable programming in either Java or Python, this class isn't that hard. It's the best executed/managed class so far in my 3rd semester in this program. The teaching is great in conveying difficult concepts into practical examples. Like many already stated, the TA (David Joyner) is amazing. Highly recommended course! This class is not that bad in my opinion. Initially it can be overwhelming( first project) but once I got over that it was not too difficult. I feel like this is a class that rewards you for working. to the point to where you won't study, or read for 20 hours only to miss on small concept that will mess you up. I feel like this is fair and if David is in here then you will love him. Highly recommend.  This is a lovely lovely AI class. The projects are great. The homeworks give you a lot of freedom on how to cover several topics. The teaching team is AWESOME. Dave Joyner (the TA), was nominated for a big TA distinction.  The course is quite interesting - it approaches AI from the point of view of minimal training data. It covers a number of approaches on how to create AI knowledge, largely from rule based systems. \n\nI enjoyed the course and received accolades for my work. The course is extremely well organized, enjoyable and fun. \n\nHowever, I think the course is a little heavy on the paper writing side. \n\nThe project doesn't map entirely well to the material taught, especially in the second half. I really enjoyed the challenge of the project, which is done in 3 phases. \n\nI would recommend this class, its a great contrast to machine learning. First, you will get stressed because of the project and writings especially if you are not familiar to coding. But at the end, you will learn a lot and discover yourself as a very creative human being. \nLot of fun if you are ready to enjoy and love challenges! This is a fun class to take. The lectures were an interesting overview and jived well with what you might read in the news about AI (like self-driving cars, etc. ). \n\nThe programming projects were a little time-consuming for me (as someone with minimal programming background) but doable, and very interesting. I ended up solving some Raven's matrices with \"artificial intelligence\" that I couldn't solve myself. \n\nAs for lessons learned: I postponed using visual representation in projects as long as I could (it is optional in Projects 1 and 2 but you must use it in Project 3) but it turned out it was far easier than using the verbal description.  This was an enjoyable class. Overall, I'm glad I took this one as my first in the program. \n\nFor me, the bulk of the time was spent on writing, including thinking about topics, drafting, and editing. In a perfect world, I would prefer to trade some of the writing time and spend it on the optional reading assignments instead. To illustrate the volume, the word count heuristics from the teaching team led to about 15k words in total across all the assignments. I recommend front loading and starting with a strong, steady pace early in the semester. \n\nThe work included a mix of written assignments, code/applied projects, project write ups, exams, and peer feedback. This mixture resulted in a nice balance to the grading, with no one assignment making up the bulk of the course grade. The balance of broad topical coverage with more deep dives in the assignments was also good. \n\nThe teaching team was really great, and the feedback and grades on assignments were returned in a very timely manner. Piazza provided plenty of interesting reading and interaction for those so inclined, from both the teaching team and the students. There were plenty of office hours, and even some optional sessions with external professors on relevant topics.  Like many have said, this course is a very high-level view of a broad set of AI concepts. Good writing skills (with diagrams) are key to achieving high scores, as all assignments, projects, and exams are in writing. The project is very interesting and challenging, and all assignments and projects are released at the beginning of the semester so it is possible to front-load the project and finish it early. By far my favorite class in the OMSCS program so far. Lectures are well structured. Assignments and exams are mostly written high level designs using different AI concepts. Projects themselves require lots of programming, my only complaint is that you can do well on all the projects while only using concepts learned in the first few weeks, there doesn't seem to be a good way to apply the advanced topics covered later in the course. Feedback on assigntments was also spotty. Instructor participation on Piazza is great and incredibly helpful.  This is my first OMSCS class. I recommend it. This class has time-consuming programming projects for the perfectionist. In order to solve all the problems, I had to sometimes spend 25+ hours just on the coding portion. However, to get an A, you do not to do this much work. The lectures and topics are easy to grasp. The midterm and final are take home. The TA and Professor are very involved: I personally met with the TA during office hours a few times. The projects are partially auto-graded which makes for predictable grading. The weekly essays all have the same, predefined rubric, so you can know what your grade is going to be if you apply yourself.  Absolutely one of the best courses I've EVER taken in academia. Taking this class first in OMSCS has really reflected well towards the whole program. The instructors and TAs really deserve recognition for this. Maybe it's because the course material is just so darn interesting, but WOW, I've never felt this inspired to learn. The assignments are thought provoking, and the project is an absolute blast. \n\nI disagree with what others have to say about needing to be a \"python expert\". I program in. NET at my day job, and found the jump to be fairly easy. It absolutely helps if you're a strong programmer, however. If you're not, what are you doing in a masters computer science course anyways?\n\nA minor critique about the class - maybe less writing assignments, and more programming assignments. Often throughout the class I wished I was given time to implement some of the ideas you write about. Also, the project is amazing, but I think they need to reexamine their policy on what external libraries you can use. I've felt like the project is more a visual processing assignment than an AI one.  Good survey course on the relationship between knowledge and intelligence. The strength of the class is it's thoughtful structure -- lessons are well laid out, supplemental reading material allows you to dig as deeply as you'd like. This is not an overly technical class, mostly theory (some of it of the hand-waving-magic type). Pizza very active with students, TAs and Professor. \n\nOther posts have covered the amount of writing (3 assignments, 3 project reflections, mid-term, final) -- you can either dread these or look at them as a chance to explore and refine your understanding of the material. There was an alternate project - chatbot - offered after the mid-term which I worked on -- very rewarding but double the workload of what it replaced. \n\nIf you are specializing in Interactive Intelligence this is a must-take. If you are new to OMSCS you may love or hate this class based on your interest in the material and willingness to write prose vs code. This was easily one of the best courses I've ever taken! The concepts in the lectures are explained very well, the time requirement for the lectures isn't insane, and David Joyner and the TAs were extremely helpful. The writing assignments are thought provoking and not at all overwhelming. The Ravens Matrices project is definitely hard, but you have all semester to work on it, and after you get the basics of it set up it's actually a lot of fun. I think this was the most enjoyable course so far.  I was very excited to take this course after seeing much of the positive feedback from various sources. With one month to go, I do not think I would recommend this course over other courses which have deeper roots in math. The lectures are full of high level concepts and the ideas seem very familiar. It feels like a lot of the material is stuff that most students should already know, but with new terminology. \n\nThe Ravens project was interesting for the first and second iteration. Doing the verbal approach in the first felt like a direct application of the earlier AI concepts. Attempting the visual approach for the second felt less so. I have not started on the third part, but I have ideas on what to implement at this point, and it might not be based on any of the concepts in this course. There are some students that will be creating an AI chatbot for their third project, and they may find more success in using the material from this course. It feels like the Ravens agent does not have a feedback loop to improve itself and is therefore lacking in the learning portion of an AI agent. \n\nThere is a bit of writing required for this course. The reflection papers that are required with each project submission are not so bad, since the students write about what they implemented and relate it back to the class topics. The stand alone assignments were slightly aggravating, because you talk about the general topics and how they could potentially be used to solve difficult problems. The mid-term felt the same. It was difficult to judge how in depth to go into the problems. And it was also tough to know if the solutions were implementable. It would have been nice to do smaller coding assignments and write on those experiences. Although, I may be in the minority with this feeling, because from the peer feedback system I came across a number of nice papers filled with figures and well thought out solutions. This is a well-put-together and rewarding class. The instructors put a lot of work into structuring the lectures, projects, and assignments in a way that really engages. \n\nThe only real complaint I have is that they don't seem to actually read the student code. Many of the projects they choose as exemplary are nigh-unreadable messes pulled from a wide variety of source material rather than a carefully-crafted reflection of the students' own work. While this is not a class in development practices, I'd like to see some enforced in the work the instructor touts as an example other students should follow.  I loved this class. The TA is the best!! The lectures are great. The programming projects take up most of your time. No prereqs needed.  Above descriptions are pretty much on the money - I really like this class, fun challenge to write an agent to solve a visual intelligence test. As above say, go visual ASAP, you won't be working any harder than those who don't. But then you will be much better positioned for the more advanced work, which goes visual. Can't use CV2, which was my first thought after Comp Photo. But it was no loss, better to start thinking differently. At least skim the papers, you will get ideas. Would have liked one assignment to be something on fractal or affine methodology. Assignments got old, but they made sure I watched the videos, and read the 'not' required text.  There is a fair amount of writting in this class. The first paper is the most stressful. After the first paper exemplary papers are posted so that you can get a gauge of what the instructors are after. The projects require quite a bit of work, but are feasible with proper planning. A nice aspect of this class is that all of the projects build on one another so you won't be starting from scratch for them.  Every week you should submit a 1000+ words essay or a programming project with a 1500+ words reflection. If your major is Modern English Language, I'd say this class is ideal for you. The project may be done in a very sophisticated way or a very simply way, according to your knowledge and implement methods. Won't recommend this.  Awesome class overall. Like others have mentioned, this class is extremely well organized and run. I really enjoyed working on the projects as well. One tip for the projects - start the visual method early in the semester. I regret not doing so and did poorly on the final project. Also, there are a lot of written essays for this class which can be somewhat tedious. I highly recommend this class to others.  It's an interesting class, but the difficulty of the course is subjective. It's a balanced class where you will write alot of papers as well code alot. The exams are open book, open notes, essay based, and that reduced a lot of stress of not having to cram everything. During the semester, we worked on a project to solve a visual analogy test known as ravens progressive matrix. The project was only hard in the beginning during the first phase, afterwards, it was fairly simple. If you're enthusiastic and figure out some of the tricks in the beginning of the project, then this class might actually be pretty easy for you. Video lectures - presented at a high level. You watch them for an hour and feel none the wiser for it, and they definitely do not prepare you for assignments/project. I found that if you want to learn the subject, it is a much better use of your time to review the 'optional' reading. \nProject - Based on solving the RPM problems, split into 3 iterations. Students are given very little constructive feedback between iterations. Submission results in Bonnie give very little feedback as well - some students were getting timeouts, memory errors, other errors - but system returns nothing specific and TAs were not helpful on Piazza. The real complexity of this project is not KBAI - it is Computer Vision (they don't allow you to use CV libs yet it's not listed as a prerequisite)\nAssignments - I actually like writing, so these I enjoyed. It is a lot of writing, and I found that looking at the Winston book really helped me learn the concepts. At first I thought just watching lectures would be enough, but the lectures don't actually teach you anything of substance to answer these assignment questions. \nMidterm/Final - Essentially a more advanced version of the assignments. Our questions were about chatbots, and a metacognition component that could explain our RPM agent's decisions. Fun if you like writing, and they definitely chose good subjects. \n\nThe tragic thing is that this course has so much potential, as the subject matter IS interesting and all over the news. You saw the excitement at the beginning of the semester on Piazza in the active discussions. Those fizzled pretty fast. \nI do hope to improve the course offering they 1) eliminate RPM as a project and replace it with something that actually uses/teaches the kbai concepts 2) redo the lectures to actually teach the material (with proper level of detail)", 
    "CS-7641": " There has been so much said already about the course that I don't feel the need to go into details, but I'll just say that this was my favorite course so far in my OMSCS journey.  The material is vast, but the goal is to give you high level understanding of a broad set of tools.  Specifically, the professors focus on what certain algorithms do, what specific algorithms are good and bad at, intuition behind how they work, and how they are similar and different from other algorithms.  The focus is NOT on how to implement each individual algorithm or how to use specific ML tools and frameworks.  I heard or read at some point (maybe even during a lecture?) that one of the goals of the class is to provide students the tools to become ML researchers.  I think this course does a great job at that, while also giving students the opportunity to pick up specific tools as they desire.\n\nIn my opinion, it helps to take DVA before this class if you are not coming from an ML background.  Even if you don't use the R language for the assignments in this course, that class can get you in the right mindset for what kinds of plots and plot-layouts to put into a report to make the best use of your limited space.  Also, that course goes into some detail on logistic and linear regression.  While those topics are not covered in detail in this course, that discussion is still a good primer for topics in this course, including things like brushing up on rusty linear algebra skills and learning to do write vectorized code. this class requires a solid understanding of statistics and calculus. if those skills are rough this is a tough class to complete or even understand. One of my favorite courses of all time. Pair lecturing is *phenominal* - and the Isbell/Littman is awesome. The math and other lecture content is not terribly difficult. The time sink in this course is the assignments. The instructions are vague and open ended, while the grading is very strict if you don't do what you didn't know they wanted you to do without them telling you to do it. USE THE TOOLS THEY RECOMMEND. Your code is worth zero points; your analysis is all that matters. So do not spend time writing code, spend it writing the analysis. They are very secretive about the midterm and final. The test format is like any other college test, but they are hard - you probably cannot get the right answers by intuition during the test, even if you are very familiar with the topics; the answers tend to require reasoning abstractly under time pressure (although less time pressure on the final). Exam grading is very coarse - as though it's done by the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, earning zero points for the slightest provocation. Everyone should take this course.  This class is definatly Math heavy, not that you need to actually solve equations (although you do) but that you need to understand the underlying principles of the math in order to do well in the class. I found the workload to be very difficult. I was taking two classes & working full time, and there were many weeks I just ran out of time. I think the subject is very interesting and you do get a good overview of what ML is and how it is applied. The projects are where you are really able to apply the concepts to real data, and this is a bit of a shame, because if you dont have a rich data set to use, something you are passionate about, and understand well, it can be very difficult to do well on the papers. Becase you wont really know what the application of the various alorithms is telling you, and that can reall imact your understanding of ML in general Lots of material covered. The math is not extremely difficult, but you will want to reserve enough time to become familiar with it. The projects are very intense, and the learning curve on tools alone will chew up tons of time. Great course, but be prepared to work your fanny off.  Ok... \n- The assignements are so hard... I got 50% at each even I spent so much time on that\n- A big problem : they don't say how they grade you so I had no clue how I could improve!!\n- The class material is very good and the teachers sooooo cool\n- You learn a lot in this class very usefull, general things about ML\nOverall that's a must taken, even if it is really hard Amazing professors and great lecture videos. Unfortunatley, lecture videos provide 10, 000 feet overview of the concepts and were little helpful for actually doing the assignments. Assignment are very open ended, time consuming, and sometimes confusing. I found very little guidence on how to preprare for the Mid-Term. Mid Term is really important as it has 25% weight. I would recommend watching all the lecture videos early in the course and study text BOOK deeply.  Great professors, great topics. Assignments require a lot of time.  If you need to refresh on statistics, I highly recommend you take the statistics course on udacity before hand. \nIf you work fulltime or have a busy schedule; I recommend you take this class by itself; It requires a lot of time. \n\nUdacity statistics class: \nhttps://www. udacity. com/course/st101. \n\nPart 1 of this class (Intro to AI), may also help: \nhttps://www. udacity. com/course/cs271 I dropped the course half way through. The lectures and material were amazing and very interesting. But the time commitment was just impossible. I was taking another OMSCS course at the time and I realized that I could simply not do both at the same time. This course had the larger time commitment so I dropped it. I really enjoyed the lectures and actually watched the rest of the lectures before dropping the course as I found the material really interesting. The time commitment comes from the papers you have to write. You dont actually write any machine learning algorithms. You download prepackaged algorithms, run them on non-trivial datasets and write papers comparing their performance and drawing conclusions. It requires a lot of knowledge in math (stats, etc) and just took way too much time. I took the midterm before dropping and did pretty well. I felt the midterm was extremely fair. But those papers, it will consume all your time.  This was my final class of the program and I am now officially finished with grad school (yay!) and this is without a doubt the most time consuming/challenging class I took in the whole program.  To compare it against even the 2nd most challenging class is a huge difference and to be honest this is probably the difficulty level all classes should be for this program.\n\nIf you are taking this class you really need to mentally prepare yourself for the time consuming workload that lays ahead of you.   The class gives you no time to breathe.  Even from day one you need to watch all of the lectures and get started on the first assignment which is due in 3 weeks.  After that you have 3 weeks until the next one is due, then you have 2 weeks until the midterm.  This pattern repeats all the way to the end.  You will never have a week off.\n\nThe assignments are not difficult to code, but very time consuming.  This is because the lectures go over the theory and math behind the algorithms and its up to you to figure out how to actually code them (using libraries.)  One positive is that you can actually steal code.  Yes, you heard that right.  You can Google someone else's code and use it if you want.  I know many people just used the code some previous students created for the class and this is perfectly fine.  I actually coded all 4 assignments myself and learned a lot.\n\nThe biggest problem with this class as others on here have mentioned is you have no idea how well you are doing or if you are even going to pass the class.  Until final grades came out I thought I was going to get a C and was prepared to take the class over again.  I did well on all four assignments (82, 79, 92, 90) which were all above the class mean, but completely bombed the midterm and final (34, 49) and somehow managed to get an A with the huge curve.\n\nIf you are going to take this class, get as much knowledge about ML as you can by pre-watching the class lectures on Udacity, or take one of the many ML courses such as the Andrew NG ML class from Stanford.\n\nOverall this class was great.  It was a ton of work but I learned a lot and will be continuing to study ML and will possibly be thinking about a career change to go into this field. Very difficult course with a lot of material. You really have to learn a lot of additional material outside of the book and the lectures on your own. Easier if you have some experience with Machine Learning software; otherwise try to get started before course kicks off by reviewing some ML tutorials.  This course is possible with a dusty grasp on statistics / linear algebra. \n\nThe projects require 60+ hours each; most of your time will be getting the code to work / generating the graphs. \n\nFrustration points:\n*The instructor doesnt care what language you use, but there are DEFINITELY bad choices. Proj 2/4 (almost) require Java; 1 is best done in Weka (from Java), and 3 is best in Python/R. \n*You pick 2 data sets - dont make your own. Download two datasets that are already prepped for machine learning / close to it (I selected two out of a ML book I bought, with the professor's permission). \n\nThe tests are designed to knock you on your butt; a 50% is a decent grade. \n\nAll of that said, the instructor is good and genuinely cares how well you do. \n\nThe material is alien, the math is dazzling, and the projects will take a long time; that said, there is a generous curve. IF you at least hand SOMETHING in / make an attempt, you will get a B. This is an endurance class, so hang in there! This was the hardest class I've ever taken. I also learned more than in any other class I've ever taken. Projects were very open ended. You could pick any technology you wanted though most gravitated to one or two obvious choices. There is almost no starter code for anything. The midterm is insanely hard and designed to be almost impossible to complete. Solid, difficult but not unsurmountable class that covers a large chunk of machine learning. Sadly, although neural nets are quickly covered, this class hasn't really been updated to the new deep learning age, but it will still give you strong basics on ML. \n\nThe professor encourages students to \"steal\" code, which is kind of interesting and I think makes this class much closer to actual ML practice in your professional life (where you are very unlikely to implement an ML algorithm from scratch, but need to understand how they work). This course requires lots of additional learning in order to success in midtern, final, and to complete homework assignments.  I didn't enjoy the course (I seem to be a minority!). The material was interesting, but it was mostly what I found on my own. The lectures didn't really go in depth; they seemed to be more of a summary of what you needed to know, then go look it up. I utilized many outside resources for this (there are excellent resources out there). So, overall, it didn't really feel like a course, more like a reference. Looking things up that you know are on a video is hard to do, though. Office hours were inconsistent, too, and it was really hard to get my questions answered (I used stackexchange often to look things up). Since the class was so vague, I felt like I was guessing at what concepts I needed to know. I'm for independent learning, but it doesn't make sense to me in the context of a class with deadlines. I'm not done (at the time of this writing), so we'll see how the remaining projects and final exam goes.  The course is decent. The assignments are easy but time consuming. Prior class on ML like the one by Andrew Ng on coursera helped a lot. The lectures in the course didn't go in depth, so outside resources or participation in discussion forums will be required. Professors and TAs are active on Piazza and you usually get your queries resolved in short time. The assignemts are roughly at the intervals of 2-3 weeks. I used to take a 2 week break after submitting one assignment and work 30-35 hours in the last week (sleepless weekend). Overall I feel it's an easy course if you already have a background in ML. Doing the course on coursera (completely: submitting the assignments and solving the quizzes) before taking this course with help a lot. Midterm was conceptual. You do not need to memorize facts which you can look up on the net to be successful in this course. Instead you should be able to understand the materials, which may demand watching few video lectures more than once. For the exams, watching the lectures throughly and understanding the materials should be enough.  This was my fist class in the OMSCS program and my 3rd CS class ever. There was a large amount of work on the assignemnts wough the tests were not so hard. The concepts in this class were somewhat difficult to grasp but not imporable. Overall I had a lot of fun and I learned a lot.  This was my first ML class, and I took it with CS 7637 while working full time. I had almost no free time during the semester. Gym time was cut by 2/3, which was the most regretable part. The semester was like a boot camp where I'm constantly doing projects dued on Sundays, squeezing 30+ hours of coding into each Fri/Sat/Sun. I seriously contemplated about dropping this class at least twice due to the amount of time required. I'm glad I didn't. This class was definitely the hardest that I've ever taken, and the most satisifying to complete. The lectures are top notch. I had to watch most video at least twice to understand them. They grade very slowly, and offer no feedback on test results. Grading on tests is tough. I used Java exclusively, but I think the more popular industrial tools are in Python or R. If taking two classes, take it with an easy one. I'm keeping all my projects for personal future reference. Good luck, have fun.  As you can see from the above comments, you should be prepared to work hard. I had taken lots of machine learning MOOCs in the past, and so thought I was well prepared for this class (also I have a strong mathematics background). It still took a surprising amount of work. Don't try to reinvent the wheel - I took far more time than I needed to doing that. It's an excellent class, and you'll learn quite a lot. And it looks like there is a sequel course coming, on reinforcement learning. :-) This was my first class in OMSCS and I found it very difficult but also very educational. The difficulty for me mostly came from the fact that this class is very theoretical and uses relatively esoteric tools for the projects (WEKA). Even though I got a B in the course (which is considered bottom 50%) I found this class to be excellent prep for CS7646 (Machine Learning for Trading). This class rocks. It teaches you how to be a wizard who can find patterns in seemingly random data!!! I found the lectures to be extremely engaging and did not require that much supplementary material outside of the text book. The banter between Professor Isbell and Professor Littman is money. The assignments are relatively tough (especially the first one due to its length), but unless you try to be superman and implement the algorithms yourself (to quote Professor Isbell \"steal\"), they are very manageable. The midterm is hard in large part due to the time limit (90 minutes), but the final was more straight forward (with 180 minutes). \n\nSeriously though this course taught me several skills that I am already applying at my workplace. Don't take it lightly, but don't be intimidated by it either.  A very rewarding course. It is pretty fast paced - a lot of ML algorithms are covered and there is a lot of reading to do. However, you learn to use ML tools in the market (I had to program in Java and Python - many others used R) and to not reinvent the wheel. There are a couple of things I struggled with\n1. Picking the right datasets. You have to use the same dataset in 3 assignments, so ensure that you pick datasets \n- running a bunch of classifiers on them to ensure that they don't all predict in the same or similar range, nor are they too easy (>95% accuracy) or too difficult (<50% accuracy)\n- ensuring you understand the underlying data - you'll have to really care about the data else you'll have a hard time explaining your results\n2. Switching from Java to Python and back\n\nI'd recommend sticking with the following libraries/packages for the various assignments \n1. Weka for Assignment 1 (many also used Python and R)\n2. ABAGAIL for Assignment 2 (This has a lot of starter code to help you)\n3. Scikit Learn for Assignment 3 (Weka has ICA missing)\n4. BURLAP for Assignment 4 If you take this course, the professor will tell you.. \"When you'll look back at this course, you'll have tears in your eyes, but they'll be tears of joy\".. that's very true. \n\nThe course doesn't require skilled programming. You can get through the subject without much programming, but it does require extensive reading and really understanding the concepts of Machine learning, which are very dry initially (You have been warned), but once you start to get hang of them, they are pretty astonishing. \n\nThe subject matter is pretty dry but the professors are really witty and jolly and you'll love them. They have made every effort to keep discussion light and intuitive and I think they succeeded. \n\nBe ready to give a VERY lengthy midterm exam in 1. 5 hours, which is almost impossible to complete (I completed mine in 1 hour 29 minutes and I had prepared it for over a month). The final exam is the same length but you get 3 hours to complete, so there is no rush. \n\nTake this course if you're willing to dedicate time for it. The assignments will consume a lot of your time, there are 4 of them. Expect at least a week for each assignment. This is a compulsory course for ML specialization and I loved it. The professors make the class very interesting. It strongly emphasizes on the analysis part of different algorithms rather the coding part. We are free to steal/use any code as we like for the projects. The workload is quite heavy, exams are ProctorTracked. Overall, a wonderful course. This class didn't work for me. I didn't like the setup. If I had more background it would have been good but for a beginner I didn't get much from it. Your mileage may vary.\n\nMy biggest issue is that you do an open ended assignment but never get anything that tells you what you should have seen. I didn't know UL and I still don't. Do not take it if you are not ready with the prerequisites. Found it imposible to understand some topics as I made that mistake. Also add scikit-learn as a prerequisite, if you are into python, or WEKA, if you are into java. Every assignment got harder. Given the chance would have dropped the course, but realised this only in March.  Great course, but I took it without prior ML background and without meeting prerequisite skills in statistics and linear algebra. Predictably, that made this course extremely challenging and time-consuming. The course description is very clear about needing either those skills, or time to learn them along the way, and they're not kidding. I also had to spend a lot of extra time getting up to speed with the Python libraries for data science, such as numpy and matplotlib. With a full-time job and family, there's no way I could have taken another course on top of this one unless I had those prerequisite skills already in the bag. Still, I made it, so you can too.  Lectures are fun but not even close to the only thing that's necessary to do the assignments. Assignments are very frustrating, and take many hours to do. The TAs who grade all of the assignments are incredibly inconsistent and generally unhelpful. An A isn't difficult to get since the curve is so heavy but the class as a whole is extremely frustrating.  This is a difficult (time-consuming) but worthwhile course. The assignments can be annoying since they are relatively open-ended with no rubric. As such you're pretty much have to try to answer as many questions as you can as concisely as you can. The exams focus heavily on ideas and concepts, but this does not mean the material is light on the details! In order to perform well I believe you will have to understand the material in some depth. \n\nOn the assignments, they are a huge time sink, and I would recommend choosing the smallest possible problem to answer. Be prepared to run through assignments multiple times to contribute very little to your actual assignment writing. On the tooling side, I ended up using R, Python, Java and MATLAB. I would say the best idea is to be comfortable on many different platforms, and pick the one which you feel will solve the problem the easiest. It is a matter of choosing the best tool for the situation. With that in mind I think that it is essential to at least know a little bit of Java for assignment 2 using the ABAGAIL library, since MIMIC algorithm is not really implemented anywhere else. (MIMIC is based on an algorithm which is the subject of Charles' research). Be prepared for learning curve on the tools that you will use, because at least for me I ended up trying many different tools for my assignments, before settling on one. \n\nOverall, I have enjoyed the course and have learnt a lot.  I wanted to like this class more than I actually did. It was okay, but after reading stuff here I was expecting more :) The lectures are fun, and Charles is very involved. It seems like he believes very much in the teaching style of burying people and then standing by as they dig themselves out while providing little hints to help. Its a fine strategy, and it does force the students to learn themselves with effort. As to the assignments, there were parts of them that I really enjoyed, but mostly they were just a lot of work to do. The parts that I enjoyed were where I had a flash of inspiration and was able to come up with applciations of the problems to solve things that I found cool, but without those flashes just meant that you are spending hours and hours thinking about random datasets that aren't really that exciting. The assignments are very open ended, and they basically just say 'Answer all of the questions that you can think of about [something]', but do note that there are specific requirements that you are graded against, you just don't get to see them in advance. This didn't impact me very much, but I know that others were annoyed that they lost points for something that wasn't specifically called out as a requirement. The TAs went through bursts of being responsive, but then we wouldnt hear much for weeks. Oh, and the peer review system that they set up was worthless. They said it was optional, but then mandated that you could only get answers from TAs about your grading through the peer review system (so much for optional), and the peer feedback came too late to help with anything.  Very hard course to complete due primarily to the effort (many hours running simulations and drafting reports) and the ambiguity in grading.   Four assignments are open-ended research with hidden rubrics.   Two exams are quite difficult, and the mid-term is intentionally oversized such that completing it in the 90 minute window is quite challenging.\n\nThere's a lot of great foundational content but it can get lost in the lectures, which tend toward abstract math and two smart guys proving how clever they are.   You often feel like you're overhearing a bar conversation you don't quite understand, and wondering why everyone else is laughing.\n\nDuring the semester Professor Isbell was active in Piazza, but did not offer much by way of clarifying content or projects.   TAs were mostly radio silence.   Significant delays in grading led to lots of stress and churn within the forums.\n\nIf you specialty is not ML and you're merely curious about the topic take either AI (as much rigor but significantly better run) or ML4T (softer introduction to the concepts).   If you are in the ML specialization take AI & ML4T before this class, it will give you a leg up. This course was very challenging and time-consuming. The projects are fairly open-ended and require a lot of analysis. I found the lectures interesting and the tests fair. The professor is active on Piazza and the TA's office hours were crucial to completing the projects. I would highly recommend this as a survey course in Machine Learning! I dropped the first time, I'm doing well this time. \n\nThe first time I understood very little because I had little knowledge of the subject. Since then, I've learned from various sources. Now when I read the book I actually understand. My best advice is to find classes in Coursera, in OMSCS, etc to give you background: because this class doesn't. \n\nLectures: VERY GOOD explain concepts quite clearly (see caveat above)\nProfs: FUN, participative, great. \nTAs: some are very helpful (esp. Elijah)\nAssignments: VERY POORLY designed. \n\nTip: Pyhton, ABAGAIL\nOnce past the smoke screen of indecision and tool barriers. The assignments are actually just a lot of busy work. You are also expected to dominate things not taught (ROC, precision vs recall... ). No methodology taught in detail in spite of this being the emphasis. \n\nMy best advice? If your specialty allows it, skip this class. Watch the videos for free on Udacity and learn ML elsewhere. The assignments are just wasteful of your time.  The class starts off slowly and about a month time for the first assignment. Even after reading all the reviews and professor's push, delayed to start the assignment and the price was paid in the assignment marks. I finished running all the experiments but didn't have time to write the analysis for which the assignment is graded. Write up is the key. Do not stress much on interesting data sets. Choose two data sets with different type of attributes, <30 in number and with <5000 instances. This will help in running the experiments faster and saving up time for analysis. Later I could score really well in rest of the assignments. Assignments constitute 50% of the grade. Midterm and final constitute rest 50% with equal proportion. Mid term was 1.5 hrs long and final was 3 hrs. Mid term is made purposefully lengthy. It had all T/F questions with 2 points each in the beginning for which a small explanation is required. Later there were 12-20 points questions. So time management is crucial for Midterm. Final had the similar pattern with double amount of time and it was fine. The exams do not require to memorize the proofs or complex equations but basic ones. I have used the following tools/libraries for assignments. 1. WEKA (Java IDE) 2. ABAGAIL (Java) 3. SCIKIT-LEARN (Python) 4. BURLAP (Java). It is better to start the assignment early and to get familiarized with the libraries. Its better to decide on the type of graphs to be produced and stick to them. I always got tempted to include more graphs but ended up not using them due to 10 pages space constraint. It is better to focus on important graphs and good analysis. Guidelines or sample analysis won't be available. It is better to read some papers and follow the format. I could only go through the videos after a point but not the readings, still managed to get an A and felt able to synthesize the content is good enough. Overall, a great course for which we feel accomplished after completing.  I did some preparation ahead of this course including watching class videos and choosing datasets but this course was still a ton of work and it is designed to be like that. Assignments always went down to the wire and I found myself working non stop throughout the entire semester. On reflection, my knowledge and performance gain in this course reads like a tsunami - I started of with a poor first assignment and average mid-term to really nailing the later assignemnts and final. The peer review really helped here and the constant work contributed to some real learning interia. I almost dropped this subject before the W deadline but am really pleased I perservered. The open-ended nature of the assignements I believe is deliberate, I needed to experience the tools to be able to understand the problems given and that is where a lot of my learning occurred. I spent a lot of time agonizing over the choice of tools. Ultimately I just selected R, despite not having any experience in this package, and just ran with it. I used the recommended java packages for the rest and just immesered myself in those.  Great class. It was hard but I learned alot. The supplemental readings are really important in internalizing the information and going to an advanced understanding but just the lectures 'mostly' are sufficient for the tests and assignments. The key on the assignments is to read the instructions carefully and include everything they ask for and remeber that they really are only looking for analysis that demonstrates you understand how the algorithms work and how to use them properly.  Very engaging. I learned not only about machine learning, but how to think about machine learning. The assignments are very open ended, so open ended that it began to hurt my head on how I should proceed to do my assignments, I wanted them to be good, but at the same time reasonable to solve. (In retrospect I would go with making easier problems rather than flashier, more intricate problems). Basically, this was an excellent way to learn how to implement a machine learning problem in the practical sense. If the assignments are the practical side of ML, then the exams were the thereotical side. The midterm was hard, I couldn't even finish the whole test, this is expected so it is generously curved, they are also very lenient with grading it, so move fast on the midterm. I just finished the final and didn't find it to be as difficult as the midterm. I enjoyed both tests. And although the implementations of the algorithms were not required to be done for the course, the algorithms were given in class and left to the student to implement himself if he wanted to. I was not too fond of this at first, but realized that I learned more about the behavior of data and machine learning algorithms by seeing how they worked in a practical sense. If one wants to learn more indepth about how algorithms should be implemented look at the Coursera. com course on Machine Learning, which I also highly recommend. I am excited for the new reinforcement course taught by the same professors in the Fall. Its good to know Java and Python for this class. As I am sure the TA were quite backed up this semester, I was not happy with the grading system. Points on assignments seem to be taken off without much justification.  I really have mixed feelings about this class. True, the interaction of the two professors during the lectures is fun to watch but in the end I found it boring. The lectures take so long to get to the point, they are quite shallow and we never see an application of the algorithms (I thought it was a strong point of the Andrew Ng's lectures). The assignments are painfully long and the grading is so frustratingly inconsistent. Most of the time a assignment requires to solve twice the same problem for no other reason than to take up your time. There is so much material covered that we learn everything to a very shallow level and the math that everybody seems to be scared about is never used during the assignments nor during the exams (which makes the math requirements quite low I think). This being said, I have learned so much during this class and that makes a very effective foundational class for the rest of the master. If the Machine learning specialization is the one you want, start by this class! I would even add that I would not have succeeded in the interview process I just went through without this class experience.  Life changing course! Lectures are sometimes hard to comprehend and almost always need to refer to thorough readings outside the lecture content. But it is made clear from beginning that lectures only a survey of various techniques. Atleast I learned what I need to learn more, which is precious. Assignments are pseudo open ended, meaning different parts of learning goal would be described but how, what data you would use, what software etc are left to us. Analysis is the key even though results may not be accurate. If focus was on experiment results, many students could concoct those as well. Hence focus on analysis. \nThis course gave me directions to explore, made some good friends, learned from many other students. What more can one ask!! This is definitely a survey course. Very broad, without a lot of time to cement knowledge.\n\nThe good:\n+ Exposure to a broad range of topics\n+ jontay's publicly available code significantly cut down on required time\n+ Generous curve\n\nThe bad:\n- Limited feedback on assignments. I wish TAs had an office hours after each assignment where they pointed out what things we could/should have learned, interesting things we might have seen, etc.\n- Lectures are too math heavy for me without adequate insight tying everything together. I'd like to see more professor driven synthesis of knowledge. The class is structured such that it's on the student to figure it out (or not)\n- Depressing grades. I got something like a 60% which somehow translates to an A. \u00af \\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n- Due to the limited feedback, your experience depends heavily on what datasets you choose at the beginning. Of course you don't know what datasets would be good until you're done with the class... Overall, the course content is well structured and covers the base of machine learning. Assignments are time consuming and require running many experiments so they are not something you can complete within a few days. The midterm is very hard with limited time frame and you also need to be working on the second assignment at the same time. Once you pass this point, the workload stabilizes. It is by no means that you have time for slack. It still requires continuous effort to study and complete the remaining projects by due date. \n\nInteraction with TAs and instructor is bare minimum. For most parts, you are on your own and officer hours is chat base in Q&A format. Having more interactive office hours with different time frames could improve course experience further. As mentioned by others, this is one of the hardest course and unless you are specializing in ML or has a deep passion for ML, this course is not recommended. The class was overall good in terms of learning through some of the concepts were superficial and hard to grasp the concepts. As Prof. mentions you will smile once the course is done and will have happy tears. Overall I liked the course and probably teaching style would have little better in terms of clarifying content. Very, very challenging course, but one everyone should take. If you want to learn how to write a paper in graduate school and research deep topics this is the course for you. It taught me plenty about Machine Learning, a topic I knew nothing about, and stretched me in very good ways. \n\nTake it! The content isn't too difficult. The lectures go into more math than you need for the tests and projects, but it's good to understand. My favorite lectures so far in this program (edit: CV, which I took later, ties or is better for lectures). \n\nThere are 4 projects that take a ton of time. Each project is open to how you want to implement it and with what libraries you like. Every time I spent several hours writing code before I could even begin the results papers, and then much more time running tests and rewriting code once I started and understood what each paper really required. It was stressful knowing another paper was due just another 3 or 4 weeks away and I had to begin immediately. Do begin immediately. \n\nAs my first introduction to machine learning algorithms I learned a so much in one semester and the class was very worthwhile. I loved this course. This class is hard. But I think that's what the professor wants to convey to the students. For me I was introduced to these concepts the first time, and hence it was very time consuming to learn to think in terms of ML concepts. Projects are hard only because its vague interms of grading and open-ended-ness. This is not a bad thing, I actually liked this approach, but since its my first time, a lot of time spent is to learn to think in terms of ML. I read all the papers and most of Tom Mitchell's book - prescribed by the TAs. They are very useful to understand these concepts. One thing is assured - all this effort will not go to waste. Its rewarding because now I am able to appreciate what ML is all about. The only draw back is the course focus is not on implementing algorithms. But ofcourse if time is spent implementing them, then less time would have to be spent talking/discussing about them. In the past I have taken Andrew Ngs Cousera course on ML, ML4T and DVA. While all those courses are good in their own way, CS7641 really dives inside the different ML algorithms. For those interested in pursuing ML this is must take. This class is tough. The workload is huge and the amount of material covered is enough for two or three 3 hour classes easily. It also cries out for a Lab session environment where students can work on projects somewhat communally and get feedback from TA's in real time. The topic is fascinating, and the professor(s) are impressive so it is overall a good experience. The lectures are mostly just summary level though. You have to grind through the text and supplemental reading to understand it. The class needs more structure in the projects. The open-ended character of the process of choosing data sets and software environments for the projects makes it 10x harder than it needs to be. You can easily find youself wasting all your project time on trying to make these decisions. One important note is that the curve is very kind. Fight the urge to drop the class because of results and difficulty; it is worthwhile to stick with it. They seem to enjoy making everyone think they are failing and then curving to mostly A's and B's. Hopefully you will have some benevolent genius classmates that are active on piazza as well - I know I could not have done it without them.  The Good:\nThe instruction style of the videos are fantastic. The dialogue between the two professors really help in learning the material.\nThe ability to use any software available for the assignments was awesome. It meant I could try new software being used in the field (like TensorFlow).\n\nThe Bad:\nHave you ever put on a blindfold spun around 10 times and then try to throw darts at a dartboard? That is what the grading is like. There is another review that states \"... we need to develop the ability to do independent research ...\". This doesn't do anything in that regard. Assignments are meant to hone your understanding of the material and a rubric helps students focus that effort to ensure it's not a futile endeavor. From the instructors comments there clearly is a rubric they use to grade. You as a student are not privy to this rubric unless you took the course before or received it from former students. \n\nI wanted to really like this course. The setup was there for it to be one of the best courses available for OMSCS. However, it is not. The enjoyment of this course was far overshadowed by the bad. The lecture videos were outstanding. \u00a0 The projects were very time-consuming, but helped me to learn the material much more thoroughly. \u00a0 Follow the clear instructions on each project and\u00a0you'll do well on them. \u00a0 My math skills are\u00a0a bit rusty, so I had to go back and do some refreshers on it. \u00a0 Some of the advanced math concepts for the algorithms were challenging, but not essential to do the assignments. \u00a0 The class was very rewarding and I recommend it, but plan sufficient time\u00a0to keep up with the workload. \u00a0 If you fall behind, you would have a difficult time recovering. \u00a0 One thing that is crucial to the class is the selection of datasets you use for your assignments. \u00a0 Picking a simple dataset won't let you contrast the algorithms, picking too large a dataset will make run-times for the projects extremely long. \u00a0 My recommendation is to find a good large dataset and pair the data down to something that runs in a reasonable time. \u00a0 Don't use small datasets with less than 1000 records.  There is a lot of good and interesting material in this class. The lectures are mostly enjoyable to watch, with joking and puns between the professors, and only occasionally does it feel like the lecture discussion goes off on a tangent or doesn't represent the material well. \nThat's the good news. \nNow the bad. Grading is nonsensical at times, you may get contradictory feedback like \"You should have talked about X... \" followed a sentence or two later by \"I see you did mention X... \" and yet you will still get docked 20% without good reason. You will be told things like \"You don't need to memorize formulas\" and \"You won't need a calculator\" for the exam, and then the exam will expect you to have memorized a formula and do the formula calculations by hand or in your head without a calculator. The grading curve is complete nonsense, you can \"fail\" by traditional standards and still get an A in the class. The assignments will not come with complete expectations in the requirements, you may get some more of the requirements by bugging the TA's during office hours but it is still not guaranteed. If you ask for an example of what is expected you will be told \"No, because then you might parrot the example\" and the professor wants you to \"be creative\" except that the TA's will penalize you for missing something expected in the hidden grading rubric that they wouldn't tell you about or give you an example of. Responses on Piazza are few and slow, especially for such a large class. Slack is a much better source of quick information but it may not be \"good\" information when it comes to things like the hidden grading rubric. \nThe class seems to be run, and definitely graded, as though it were a meta commentary on the accuracy of machine learning in general. Putting in the effort that would get you 100% in other classes will inexplicably result in much worse results in this class even if you still get an A in the end. I agree with all comments above. Probably the best course I've ever taken, even though at times I was driven to despair by the difficulty and time requirements. Brush up on your statistics before taking this and you'll be happier.  This was a cool class. Dr. Isbell was very involved on Piazza. The lecture videos were informative and very funny. I liked the super open-ended nature of the projects, but I wish they tied in with the videos more. I struggled with them (like 50% total project grade struggled), but aced the final and somehow managed to get an A. It seems like most people had less trouble with the projects though. \n\nSometimes the lectures would get really into the math underlying one small facet of ML, but you don't need to know how to implement things on the exams (this is a survey course). Focus on having a general understanding of everything and how topics relate (when to use decision trees vs kNN, how clustering algorithms compare to each other) and you'll be fine. Profs Isbell and Littman are possibly two of the best teachers of material I've encountered, and I've taken a Loooot of classes at a lot of places. The course is challenging, but the challenge comes from the material itself, and not from, say, a terrible lack of clarity in expectations and instruction. \n\nI really had very little interest in ML prior to taking this class, and I ended up really enjoying the course because of the professors. Great class with interesting subject material. Good introduction to machine learning. Definitely tough and needed many hours per week. This is a type of course that you feel smarter after the semester is over. You really learn what ML is. The class makes you synthesize the algorithms very well. Dr. Isbell and Littman are great professors. They are funny, witty and smart. There are 4 assignments in the class, each of which takes weeks to finish. So do not postpone the assignments until the very last moment. The exams are hard. If you study well, you can get an A. Overall this is a pretty decent course. The material is interesting, but the lack of clarity makes this class a little more challenging than it needs to be. There is no set rubric for assignments, and the feedback varies based on the person grading your paper. You have to pay attention to office hours to fully understand what is needed in the assignments. The midterm is too long for the time given, but you know this going in. The Final is much more manageable in terms of time/question but is about the same as the midterm in terms of difficulty.  Not a difficult class, but it demands dedication. Pay attention to the assignments, I would sugest starting work on first assignment 2 weeks in advance, just because you'll have to understand how things are working, after that you can probably start working on assignments a few days in advance. Unless you are advanced in R or Python (by advanced, I mean ADVANCED), use Weka for the first assignment, use ABAGAIL in the second one, Weka again for the third, for the fourth assignment you'll figure out what to use. Pay attention to the assignment requirements too. Don't waste your time trying to understand the math, you don't need to, and probably you won't be able to anyways. Just watch the videos, take notes, watch the videos again and then watch you tube videos on the topics you found interesting. Don't memorize anything, it won't help you in the exam, try understanding everything instead.  This course is a fair amount of work, but oh so worth it. The lectures were fantastic and the projects really help you learn subtle things about the topics you learn about in the class. I've also taken the Reinforcement Learning class and would take any course offered by Charles Isbel and Michael Littman. They are just tops in my book. This course does require a dedicated amount of time. In hindsight, I probably would have tried to get a head start on all 4 assignments within the first month. the last section of the course felt very rushed- as going from assignment to preparing for the final left very little margin of time. It probably would have been easier to just polish up the assignments before submitting by the due date. The midterm and final are really difficult, in the sense that you study a very broad area and are tested on being able to synthesize details, so it's probably a good idea to use the quizes and problem sets as practice. this course was definitely a strong introduction to the feild, after taking this class you will have good general knowledge of techniques and when to apply them. This is a great course to take if you are interested in Machine Learning. There is a bit of disorganization, as it feels that the TA's are trying out new methods, so anticipate variation in grading. I am sure that this will improve with continued iterations, as the online delivery methods improve.  As I studied the course longer, as I realized the two professors Charles and Micheal are so smart and good, I learned other ML courses from other universities, some of them are very hard to follow due to amount of math and equations, however, Charles and Micheal are very smart and experienced that they can extract the essence of this huge field and summarized into easily understood examples to guide you think and think. Study the course lectures and notes many times to understand otherwise the midterm and final are hard.  Loved the lectures, but the course could be done a bit better over-all. \nThe assignments are very open-ended. This might be good for some, but it was annoying when I spent more time trying to find a good dataset to work with the algorithm than I did actually working with the algorithm. \nThe office hours could have been done a bit better as well. I'm sure this changes semester to semester, but they seemed a little unprepared for some questions and spend half the time responding to questions via text while the recorded video was silent. This wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't used hipchat, which doesn't keep track of separate threads, so at any given point in the office hours there were 1-4 conversations going on at once. \nI learn a lot from test feedback, which we received little to none of. The midterm we got to watch a series of videos (for a few days) that went over the answers, but were never given back our answers with the scores for each. The final we received no feedback whatsoever. \nThis brings me to my final point... Until grades were released, I had no idea if I was going to get an A or an F... Seriously. The instructors were so vague on how grading worked that I had no idea if I was going to pass or not. My \"learning style\" made the assignments in this class unbearably difficult. Basically, I learn best from the Udacity-style lecture/quiz format. The assignments in this class don't \"hold your hand\". The textbook and lectures provide no details about the machine learning software required to complete the assignment. So you're really trying to learn on your own from (often incorrect) online software documentation. I was able to complete the assignments, but I don't feel I learned enough for the number of hours I had to invest. Good - Liked open ended assignments since we don't have a masters project and can select any dataset that we want. I had an idea that the projects required a dataset selection so I picked biology based datasets and took 3 MOOC's over the summer to better understand what the data meant. This included the MIT 7. 00x: Introduction to Biology and 7. QBWx Quantitative Biology Workshop. Prof. Isbell was active on Piazza answering all types of questions which I think is rare. So thank you for that. Though I do have some complaints listed below this is still the best OMSCS class I have taken so far. I expect to get kicked in the teeth for me to respect the class. I want to take the reinforcement learning class when it comes out though I will prepare for it in advance. \n\nBad - Will consume all time so don't take this course with another course. Some problem sets were assigned but solutions posted were incomplete. General lack of concrete problem examples/solutions. Needed to pull from old tests from other universities. \n\nUgly - Inconsistant grading of projects. Some received feedback of points off based on a rubric, some got only comments without telling where points where deducted and some got nothing at all. Felt some graders were tougher then others as I could tell several different grading styles. Either I had an easy grader for my third project or I got someone else's grade as it was my worst paper of the four but my highest grade. This will get worse as they may go to no feedback at all as the class size scales. You won't even know if your score is your own or a mistake. I think a few sentences describing where you got points deducted is a minimum requirement for a distance learning program for major assignments.  I agree with the comments above. I think that if you do all the work assigned, especially projects that would set you up for success especially on the exams.  Great class. Charles and Michael are extremely entertaining and make the lectures fun to watch. I definitely recommend taking this class by itself, because the assignments can take an obnoxious amount of time to complete. Start the assignments early; it takes awhile just to figure out exactly what you need to get done on each assignment, and then even longer running experiments and collecting data. STAY ORGANIZED. I also recommend using the tools and libraries suggested (Weka, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, etc. ) for the assignments. The exams aren't aren't that difficult, but simply doing the problem sets isn't enough to do well. Prof. Isbell really emphasizes 'synthesis' of the material, which I translate to: 'a general knowledge of the concept, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it relates to other concepts'.  This class is no joke. I had to marshall all of the organizational tricks I learned in the decades since graduation in order to squeak by in the this class. I certainly enjoyed the material. The lectures are a lot of fun and engaging, and surprisingly clear for the concepts presented. However, there was a big gap between the lectures/reading and the assignments, which to me felt like they really aimed to teach you how to do this type of work for yourself. Much of the learning required for the assignments was on your own. It would have been nice to have some kind more help (i. e. , domain knowledge) to get us going. Exams were mostly about 'synthesis', i. e. , demonstrating your knowledge/recall of the material through writing. reading all of the readings was very helpful for exams, but very time-consuming as well. As someone said, if you work full time, kiss all of your free time (and family time, and chore time, and etc. , time) goodbye! Good class, but put a strain on my marriage and/because it prevented me from mothering my kid.  I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot. I am writing this review a semester after finishing the class, so I am even more confident in being able to say this. A lot of the material has really stuck and I have been able to apply these principles to subsequent classes. \n\nI felt this class was more time consuming than hard. It takes a more hands-on approach rather than a theoretical one. There is a lot of time spent tinkering with data-sets and runing different algorithms. But, I never felt like I did not know how to do stuff or that the material was difficult to grasp, projects just took some time to iron out and decide how you wanted to procede with them. \n\nPersonally, I would have preferred a little more of a theoretical approach and deeper dive and increased focus on the underlying math, which was extremely light. But at the same time, this is a survey course that aims to cover a lot of topics, so perhaps it is not realistic to increase the depth too much without sacrificing breadth. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this course! First off, the GT course surveys site currently reports this as almost as difficult as 6505. This wasn't true, at least for me. This class is tedious and time consuming, while 6505 is just plain difficult and time consuming. \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures did a good job of explaining the various machine learning algorithms. Most lectures described things relatively informally (no rigorous math or proofs). For some of the concepts, I kind of wish they had explained the math behind the algorithm a bit better, but for the most part they were very good\n\nHomework:\nThe homework is structured as four projects. There were two big issues with the homework. First, there was a sizable gulf between the material presented in the lectures and what you actually had to do for the projects. There was lots of outside reading required to understand how exactly to use the ML algorithms in an analysis setting. In other words, the lectures explained how the algorithms worked but you were on your own with the homeworks in terms of comparing them and determining which performed best and why. Second, you were kind of on your own when it came to picking tools to perform your analysis. As a beginner to these concepts, I spent lots of time evaluating machine learning frameworks to determine which best suited the assignment. This meant I was spending less time actually working with the algorithms and more time experimenting with machine learning libraries. The TAs and professor occasionally made suggestions, but it would have been nice to get a list of vetted frameworks for each project. \n\nAssembling the reports for the homework was tedious. It involves running multiple (hopefully repeatable), possibly long running experiments and usually plotting the right things for each algorithm. This was by no means _hard_, but it was time consuming. \n\nGrading/Administration\nI thought grading was generous. The homeworks were graded fairly, but it would have been nice to have a more explicit rubric.  This course requires a lot of hard work if you aren't very familiar with Machine Learning. The lectures are very well created and help understand the topics, they can be standalone but the additional readings help expand on the topics (although they can be extremely long, more than the lectures). The assignments are not so hard once you get a hang of what the TA's are looking for in the grading.\n\n\nAssignment 1 and the Midterm are pretty brutal, but low grades are not the end of the world. For reference I had 50's in both and got an A. Prof Isbell wants you to understand the topics, not regurgigate reports or pay too much attention to coding.\n\nRegarding coding, you can use whichever programming language you want, but there are some recommended languages for some assignments. Code is not graded, so if you focus on delivering high quality reports you're set. Data visualization comes in very handy in all of the assignments to convey insights effectively in the least amount of time. Assignments will consume a lot of time. I underestimated the amount of effort required for assignments. I wouldn't recommend taking this course together with another workload-intensive course as it will severely undermine the quality of learning. As others have mentioned, little to no feedback on assignments is a major flaw but this happens to both the courses I have taken so far. Regarding the math involved, the materials presented in the lectures are manageble and the gory details of the ideas are mostly hidden away in the supplementary materials. Having said that, it is possible to do well skipping the supplementary resources until there is a need to refer them in the assignments. Oh, almost forgot, Charles and Michael are funny as hell. Definitely better than a boring monologue session.  One of the best courses in OMSCS, this course provides a good overview and introduction to the world of machine learning. The videos are good and lots of information to grasp, especially if you are new to this area. The expectations from assignments are pretty open ended. Overall a must take course Incredible lectures that are super engaging as I've taken more classes I just appreciate these lectures way more. The projects take a lot of time, but really give you an idea of the machine learning landscape and how easy it is to apply practical machine learning data sets to problems. The statistics behind a lot of the learning techniques is pretty advanced, but not too hard to follow. Picking a dataset was super hard and I picked a couple bad ones that I later regretted. Don't necessarily pick something you think would be cool to do machine learning on. Instead arbitrarily pick some large datasets that really let you explore the power of different algorithms. This class really gets you thinking about all the potential machine learning has and how easy it is to categorize some incredibly complex problems.  This class can be math heavy however you can pass without the background in math ( I did ) but I don't recommend it. The assignments are very time consuming because of the machine learning algorithms runtime. Each paper is around 10-15 pages and you can do endless experimentation on each part of it. Its a great course, and you will learn more than you thought possible in a semester.  The lecture videos were outstanding for the on-line course. The projects were very time-consuming, but helped me to learn the material much more thoroughly. Follow the clear instructions on each project and you'll do well on them. My math skills are a bit rusty, so I had to go back and do some refreshers on it. Some of the advanced math concepts for the algorithms were challenging, but not essential to understanding how to use the algorithms. The class was very rewarding and I recommend it, but you should plan sufficient time to keep up with the workload. If you fall behind, you would have a difficult time recovering. One other thing that is crucial to the class is the selection of datasets you use for your assignments. Picking a simple dataset won't let you contrast the algorithms, picking too large a dataset will make run-times for the projects extremely long. My recommendation is to find a good large dataset and pair the data down to something that runs in a reasonable time. Don't use small datasets with less than 1000 records.  This was one of the best courses I have taken so far in the program. The lectures are highly engaging, fun, and you very informative. The assignments are time consuming, but you will learn a lot. The tests are not easy either, but they curve the grades. If you don't procrastinate on the assignments then the course is very manageable. Definitely do yourself a favor and take this class if you want to learn ML. One of the most fun courses I've had in my academic career. In particular, it pushed me to develop intuition of mathematical concepts and algorithms and how to explain them. Assignments are often 4x more time consuming than I'd think to allocate time for (10+ page analyses over 5-20 different concepts). Exam questions were easier than expected, but the challenge is to be able to convey a sense of 'synthesis' and knowledge of the concepts -- and for both assignments and exams, good writing skills are very important. Overall, I would say it's a fantastic course and definitely worth taking for any specialization.  I don't think this is a good class. I would like to learn more about machine learning, but didn\u2019t learn much and don\u2019t like the setup of this class.\n\u2022\tYou get minimal feedback on projects and not know what to do to get the good grade on project. Doesn\u2019t understand what need to improve.\n\u2022\t You won't receive your tests back and won't know what you missed. \n\u2022\tLectures are heavy math for me without adequate insight tying everything together, and not able to understand. I don\u2019t like the lectures.\n\u2022\tDue to the limited feedback, and can\u2019t learn much without know what you do wrong.\n This class is a mixed bag. Can't say its always enjoyable cause of sleep deprivation, but it will learn you some aha moments. \nThe \"trick\" this class did was able to deliver material without imposing hard math constraints on the person learning. It's pretty neat, you can understand lots of materials. This goes over foundational ML on classifiers, optimization, probability, Markov model... then some more. \n\nYou will also learn really quickly that you can't waddle through gradschool by just having coding chops, you have to read papers and you have to decypher textbooks(Tom mitchell). Lectures are mostly overview or summary of what your synthesized understanding should carry you to say that makes sense. The quizes are not leading questions, so Go!\n\nPay attention to the pre-req:\n A little stats/probability and some light calc/linear algebra background do not hurt. \n\nFor fall 15\njava/weka/burlap - at least for Fall15 semester, if you know this, you should be OK. \npython/sklearn is trickier and could be more advanced for most people.  It is a tough but fun class. As others mentioned, this class covers a lot of ML topics and also provides a good depth, so be prepared to spend time watching/re-watching videos to understand the concepts, specially if this is your first ML class.\nFor projects, you are expected to do research on your own but as long as you meet the rubric you'll do fine. Exams on the other hand are very difficult. The grade is curved so most people end up with an A or at least a B. This was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken. Even to gain a cursory understanding of the material required many hours of reading supplementary material along with watching the video lectures. The projects were also fairly difficult and usually took anywhere from 30 to 50 hours to complete. You're allowed to use any language you want, which is nice, but make sure you find data that you're actually interested in analyzing! That will go a long way in keeping you interested and motivated in the class. \n\nThe TAs and Dr. Isbell were great on Piazza, and I felt were fair in grading. The class is very difficult, and is graded harshly, but there is a curve at the end, so don't lose hope if you feel you aren't doing well! Despite its difficulty, I found the lectures and the material to be very engaging. Topics were explained very well, and were supplemented by the readings. I very much enjoyed this class!\n\nI took this class along with Computer Networking. Overall, it was a good balance, as Networking was pretty easy, and this class was pretty difficult.  I had zero ML experience, its been 14 years since I last thought about linear algebra, and I wasn't comfortable with any of the ML libraries(like sci-kit) before this course. Its a good course, lot more theory than I liked, but it helps you learn. Assignments are basically experiments and documenting the same with no clear instructions on how to conduct those and what kind of experiments to run; I think the idea is to encourage students to explore and learn as much as possible, so that we get learn to decide what is important and what is not. Assignment grading seems unfair at times, and exams are very tough(At least for me). Advice from me; refresh your linear Algebra, and be comfortable with Python/Java so that you can work with ML libraries. At least be in \"listen only\" mode in piazza, office hours, slack channel to get hints on what experiments to run, what curves to draw in the report (I didn't do it, and that was a mistake)\nYou will learn a lot. Do not stress yourself with assignment and mid term grades. I found that individual grading may seem brutal, but the overall grading is pretty lenient. Just hang in there, do your best, and try to enjoy while you are at it. Getting a 'B' (or above) isn't that difficult IMO. \n\nProfessor Isbel is really really really good and very active in Piazza. They have an army of hardworking TA's, and piazza is very active with discussions. Overall, a very good course.  I have a different opinion of this class. It is often stated that people who struggle in this class suffer from inexperience. However, I am a senior level data scientist in the industry who has taught courses and authored packages on machine learning. In spite of that, the workload was high, and I felt the grading was arbitrary if not vicious. There is some talk that all of this will be corrected in the end with large scale curving, but that is a poor system. I ended up dropping this class, and I do not recommend it. The lectures are good, but those are free to watch at any time.  Tough class!! Few tips:\n\n1. You can steal the code - prof. really mean it.. \n2. Don't loose heart on low scores.. its war of attrition keep going... You will be fine... if you give up - u r a goner\n3. Follow slack - they share good tips\n4. Its a long class with lots going on - prepare up front - watch the videos when you can.. \n\nOverall, you will learn a ton. Prof are funny - videos are awesome - you will love it.. A week and a half after completing this class and I'm still digesting the final parts of it. The material covered in this case could fill 2 or 3 classes so be prepared for 2-3x the workload. The material isn't hard on its face, the difficulty comes from how it all fits together. I had planned to use R for the entire course, but needed to do some work in Python for a few algorithms.  This class is amazing but, challenging. If you have been out of college for an extended period of time (like myself), I would suggest starting off with something a bit easier. Make sure you do all the assignments and extra-credits as they take those into account if you are between grades. With that said though, I feel like a learned an incredible amount in this class and it really sparked my interest in neural networks. Overall, awesome class though! Disclaimer: I've done the Andrew Ng machine learning MOOC and have a personal interest in machine learning, so 50-60% of the class was not new to me. \n\nThat said, I found this class fairly easy. For both material I had seen and not seen before, Prof. Isbell and Prof. Littman did a great job of presenting the ideas, intuition, and some degree of mathematical formalism. If only my classes in undergrad were so entertaining! Maybe there were a few things that I didn't know, such as algorithms and complexity, but nothing a little Googling couldn't solve. The lecture videos take maybe 4 hours a week, with some pausing. What really kills the brain is some of the REALLY long and mathematical reading. My advice: skim, but don't skip the reading. There's a lot of interesting details, not to mention having a broad view of the field of machine learning is quite useful if you want to practice data science. So you have to be efficient. (Read: Data science != Machine learning). \n\nThe tests were fair in my opinion. They did make me think hard about the properties of the methods we studied. But they are long. It's a bit annoying to use the text entry methods on T-Square, especially when Piazza was way better for typesetting math. \n\nProbably as many people will say, the homeworks were incredibly time consuming. On average, the homeworks took me about 40 hours. This includes brainstorming ideas, programming and implementation of algorithms, collecting data, generating graphs and tables, and writing the report. I admit that I'm a pretty slow (bad?) coder, but using Python made it easier. On the other hand, Python has fewer resources and is slower than Java. But that's the practical lesson of the homeworks: balancing speed of implemention, execution time, and effectiveness. Don't make your homework needlessly complicated though, since your goal should be to master the concepts, not programming!\n\nThe recommended book (by Tom Mitchell) was pretty accessible. It's not a criticism of the class, but I thought many of the examples IN THE book were lame or otherwise uninteresting. On the other hand, the chapter introductions and especially summaries were a great review. I would recommend also checking out a few other BOOK s in addition. \n\nLast comment: Piazza is awesome, especially if you are active. I didn't find Hipchat to be very useful since it was a bit too real-time and you couldn't typeset math when you needed to explain equations or what not. I didn't attend any of the office hours.  Great survey of machine learning. Well-written exams, great discussion-style lectures, and projects that facilitate learning extremely well. The lectures for this class are the high point. At least for me, they were a joy to watch over and over again, which really helped those concepts simmer in my head (which, in turn, really helped with the final). The exams were also really fun and reflected both the high caliber of intellect and the wicked sense of humor found in the videos. \nI watched the lectures through once before taking the class - however, in retrospect, I would have been better off picking some good datasets for the assignments. Don't make my mistake and spend 20 hours during the course processing your music library into a dataset! Go into the course with 2-3 good datasets selected - datasets which are manageable enough that a neural net can do something meaningful with them. They link https://archive. ics. uci. edu/ml/datasets. html in the syllabus - you could also try http://mldata. org/ and https://bitly. com/bundles/bigmlcom/4. \nI used Weka, ABAGAIL, ABAGAIL and BURLAP respectively for the four assignments. Note that these required virtually no coding. They encourage you to do as little coding as possible for the assignments, and they are serious about this. Unfortunately, they had very specific grading criteria which they didn't share in advance of the assignment submission, particularly for the first one. It also took an insane amount of time to turn around the assignments - I got back assignment 1 on the day assignment 2 or 3 was due. Because of this it took me some time to even understand what they were looking for in the papers. \nOn the flip side, their final grades were quite forgiving, and if you had a good score on the final and the last assignment they erred on the side of giving you a higher mark. So don't let the grading scare you away.  The discussion style of the videos in this course made it a lot more engaging than the straight forward lecture style of another course I took this semester. Both Littman and Isbell have insightful questions, clear explanations, and puns. The readings are tough, but help to understand the meaning and math behind the algorithms. \n\nThere seemed to be a trend in grading where the supervised and unsupervised assignments received lower scores than the randomized optimization and markov decision process assignments. I was around the mean for most assignments, did a few points above the mean for the midterm, did better on my final, and somehow ended up with an A for the course grade. Strangely enough, I don't feel like I deserve an A because theres still so much to understand and it was clear from the piazza forum that others had a solid grasp of the material. That being said, I do want to go on and learn more about ML!\n\nMy advice for this course would be to get started on assignments early. I tend to procrastinate and the grade on my first assignment showed that. As you work through the assignments, you'll find more and more questions that you'll try to answer. In order to have an interesting paper that fits the page limits, you must be able to explain why your experimenting showed the results that it did concisely yet comprehensively. Advice bit number two would be to just go with whatever everyone else in the class is using for the assignments. Weka for assignment 1 and 3, abagail for assignment 2, Burlap for assignment 4. Keep a close eye on the piazza forums for technical help.  I wish all my classes were like this. It was very enjoyable. I felt that the two person teaching format worked really well for the course, to the point where I started to question why all courses didn't do this. It sort of reminded me of the back and forth in a RadioLab podcast. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken, and even though I have some background in Machine Learning, I felt I took away a lot of new insights from this course. \n\nIs it hard? I guess. I don't feel that it's hard to get a \"B\", but you have to work at it. I think the professor recognizes your efforts and as long as you are committed to learning the material (proving it by doing all the assignments and problem sets), then you should get at least a B. Another way to put it is that if you didn't get a B in this class, you probably weren't that surprised about it. \n\nIn terms of criticisms, this was my first course in OMSCS, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Certainly there seems to be a fair amount of growing pains in the program itself when it comes to addressing student concerns or giving out grades on time. But it also seems that the administrators recognize this and actively try to improve the environment for everyone. Over time I think some of these hiccups will iron itself out. A second criticism is that the book they recommend is a bit antiquated, given the level to which this field has evolved. It would have been nice if they upgraded to ESL or something similar. \n\nOverall though, I'm very happy that I took this course.  I'm somewhat echoing what Victor Ma said, as my perspective is of someone coming in with a pretty strong background in math modeling and statistics as well as statistical programming and data analysis. The difficulty of this course is it covers a ton of material. It mostly glosses over regression and doesn't address generalized linear models at all, nor does it go into any kind of graph analytics. There is exactly zero discussion of tools and applications. What you get is the kitchen sink of techniques for taking in data and gaining some understanding of it, as well as optimization and optimal control thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe treatment of the math is frankly fairly superficial if you have a decent working intuition of probability and linear algebra. There isn't much discussion of statistics and it would help to supplement what you get here with some outside reading about resampling, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and various loss functions. You need these to analyze the results you get. You don't need to get deep in the weeds with proofs, but understand how and why they work and what you're measuring. \n\nThe biggest thing is don't underestimate the assignments. Don't get cute trying to build web scrapers or pull real-time data from APIs, doing all kinds of feature engineering. Being a data ninja is fun, but this isn't the class for it. You'll get zero extra credit for that. Pick something from the UCI repository that is ready to throw into a train function right away. 100% of the points you get are your analysis. Use well-tested library code on simple datasets and put your effort into visualizing and explaining the performance characteristics of each algorithm, because you need to run quite a few of them. Know what a complexity curve is, a learning curve, a confusion matrix, know what the tuning parameters are for each modeling package and know how and why performance changes when you tweak them. And know the performance measures! Be prepared to explain why you would use accuracy, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, or whatever measure you use. It's specific to the problem you're trying to solve and this isn't covered in lectures or in the required text, so do some outside study. The package documentation for modeling software usually explains these things pretty well and it isn't complicated, but you'll lose points if you just use straight defaults across the board and can't justify why you chose the resampling technique, parameter tuning strategy, and performance measures you chose.  I have very mixed reviews on this course. I think this course should be renamed as \"Applied Machine Learning\". To be honest, I really liked the instructors and their teaching style. In fact, that is the only reason why I liked this class. I used to keep listening to their lectures again and again until the concepts got deeply embedded in my brain. The instructors provide the students with a good overview of the theory and derivations both through lectures and piazza materials, but the students are not tested on those in any of the assignments. The midterms and finals were not that difficult, provided the students get accustomed to the structure of the questions beforehand. One way to do that is to solve all assignments of the past Machine Learning courses taught at CMU as well as the exercise problems from Tom Mitchell's book that do not require any derivation or proofs. I did all my assignments in JAVA using Weka Library and BURLAP, although Python would have been a better option. Assignments were easy yet time-consuming. In most universities, Machine Learning courses offered by the CS department turn out to be a blend of theory, derivations, analysis and quality code execution, where most students are tested on those. Here students are graded ONLY on analysis. In fact, students are provided with the code or the software for all assignments. I did not enjoy the assignments, as I did not find those challenging enough. If the students are serious about understanding the lectures, then they need to ensure to have a basic grasp on Big O Analysis, Differential Calculus and Probability Theory before taking this course. This was a great survey course that tends towards the theory side without heavy math (but there is a lot of math, so define 'heavy' as being relative), but it took a whole lot of work. It's very easy to spend 20-30 hours on each project assignment. Study hard for each exam, and definitely reach Mitchell's textbook in addition to the supplemental material (you can skim papers, but make sure you understand them). If you have pre-canned code to run, this can greatly reduce your assignment time. I found myself writing a lot of my own code, so perhaps I could have saved countless hours if I knew which experiment to run beforehand.\n\nML is a very fair course, and they grade harshly per assignment and exam but do curve up. If you do better than the mean, you'll probably get an A. I screwed up the first assignment because I underestimated the time it took and sent it half complete (no extensions). I did at mean or better afterwards on everything, and it all worked out. They will be reasonable if you do poorly on the first assignment, but demonstrate an upward trajectory afterward.\n\nI took ML and ML4T at the same time, which had some overlap, but I found myself spending every weekend alternating between the two classes. I'd recommend taking ML alone if you're also working full time on a demanding job. I did get A's in both, but I also lost nearly every weekend for 3+ months. I guess I am at odds with the others. I did not like this course. The subject matter was interesting and the professors provided a great dynamic making the time spent watching the videos enjoyable. However, the amount of material covered on a weekly basis was like drinking from a fire hose, leaving little time to enjoy or absorb what was being taught. I also found it annoying that we had to find our own databases to analyze. I'm sure that that was perceived as a bonus by some, but for me it further diluted my ability to measure how well I was learning [through peer comparison]. I might take this class again, but likely only if it ends up being required to meet a particular specialization I'm interested in. All in all, a good topic, but I prefer a more 'results-based' class at this point in my career.  The video lectures were the best I have seen, they managed to cover a very large amount of material while still getting into the specifics of each technique in a useful way. I've taken courses on some of these general topics before and still learned a lot. The assignments are flexible in terms of content, and very time-consuming, but the skills you will need to complete them can be learned during the course (you don't, for example, need to be a great programmer). The time-consuming aspect is usually learning how to do techniques needed for the assignment in Weka or another program, then actually running all of the experiments and collecting the data, before you can even start writing the 10+ page paper. If you try to procrastinate and wait until the last few days to start an assignment, you will not do well in this course. The exams are tough but fair, if you remember and understand everything from the lessons you should be able to answer everything without getting stuck, although the midterm was purpsosely designed to not give you enough time to complete it so don't waste too much time on any given question. I would say the one downside of this course is that it will take up too much time if you have commitments outside of this program and are taking another time-consuming course. I would recommend taking this course with a course that has a more manageable workload.  The lectures in this class are awesome and interesting. I really enjoy the dynamic between Michael and Charles. The lectures themselves are not complicated (though they do take a bit of time to get through). Most of the time is spent in the assignments which are open ended and a lot of work (but good work). My only real complaint is that the course schedule doesn't quite match up with lecture order and naming. It almost seems as if things have been added to and shuffled but no one has gone back to fix up schedules and make things consistent.  Consumes a lot of time, but it is worth it. Knowledge of probability, stat, and linear algebra is super helpful.  **Overall: **  It's a hard course even with a strong math background.  I did not find the assignments to be very helpful (they sapped my enthusiasm), and the tests are hard.  TAs were not very responsive in Piazza this semester (Spring 2018).  This class is too laissez-faire (in my opinion) and fails to provide effective feedback on assignments.\n\nI had a fair amount of ML experience from previous learning (I had watched the Supervised Learning lectures a year earlier, and taken other AI classes in the past) coming into this course, but this course was still challenging.  \n\nThe lecture quality is pretty good; the professors Isbell and Littman are very knowledgable and their humorous banter in the videos is funny.  I liked the conversational style they used in the videos - it's a dialogue between the teacher (alternates between Charles and Michael) and the other plays an inquisitive student who asks questions.\n\nThe assignments were super open-ended and I felt graded quite harshly given the lack of concrete direction.  There seemed to be a hidden rubric used to grade submissions that was not shared with students in the assignment descriptions.  I felt frustrated with the assignments because I felt like I wasn't really learning much but simply twiddling hyperparameter knobs in order to generate plots for the report.  Further, the feedback that I received from the TAs was usually  weak and non-specific after they'd take off 30 points.  I spent probably 30ish hours on average for the problem sets.\n\nI wish the course offered more structure (\"Students have successfully used this GitHub repo <some_url> for Assignment #1.  Train the model, plot learning curves (accuracy vs. time and accuracy vs. iterations), do tasks X, Y, Z\") rather than giving vague instructions (\"pick some interesting problems and fiddle with the hyperparameters for algorithms A, B, and C.  Plot some stuff and tell us your observations\").  I'd also have appreciated a more specific rubric for what's expected on the assignments - I'd love to go on the intellectual journey, but please tell me the waypoints!\n\nThe exams were hard but fair.\n\nI'm happy to have this course behind me.  There were high points (lecture content is good), but the assignments were simply not helpful for my learning. This is a perfect introduction of Machine Learning. I begun watching videos and reading the textbook in summer vacation, review of both videos and the textbook again in the fall. I do not have any other experience in machine learning, just took 7646 last semester. The journey is awesome, especially the first half. Learning how to learn under pressure itself is very meaningful for me. The first assignment and midterm are warning signs to tell you that you need to really dedicate. The grading curve is friendly. \nTake it and enjoy it! Even casual observers would love it! Wonderful course with two great professors, but extremely time consuming. The projects are rewarding, but very open-ended and experimental. It was difficult to balance with a full-time job. Prepare to do nothing but school work for this class during the semester that you take it. Also, the exams were intimidating, but cool nevertheless. One disappointment for me was that you don't have enough time to implement the algorithms that you learn about and instead are strongly encouraged to use existing implementations. I would have preferred to have implemented them myself to truly learn how they work in depth.  This is a great course, tough, but very rewarding at the end. The difficulting really depends on your background. Highly recommended course except if it's your first semester in the program.  I learned a ton in this course. It's difficult and time-consuming but for me it was worth it. If you're the type of person that prefers paint-by-numbers type of assignments this class isn't for you. It is very open-ended and self-directed. The biggest challenge of the assignments is figuring out what to do as opposed to actually doing it. The lectures are great, but expect to supplement them heavily with the text BOOK and online research. Downsides: the instructor support in the forum was a bit scarce and/or untimely and the assignment grading was likewise untimely with limited feedback as the grading is based on a rigid rubric (which is hidden from you) that probably isn't ideal for such open-ended assignments. Also, the class felt very front-loaded to me as the last third was pretty quiet compared to the earlier enjoyable hell. The RL mini course doesn't tie in very well with the SL/UL stuff.  This course covers a lot of material in a short period of time. The lectures show that the professors care that the students learn, but don't understand what is complicated and what is not. They spend a lot of time on side jokes and stories as well as simple concepts and then gloss over the meat of the material. The homeworks take an incredible amount of time and are very open ended. I would've prefered the material to be cut down and gotten more feedback on smaller and more focused assignments. I spent a lot of time prepping for each homework (finding the right libraries to use, picking a data set and understanding what was expected). I hadn't taken an AI course before and this being my first semester after 5 years out, taking two courses and working full time may not have been the best choice. This class wore me out.  This is my favorite class in OMSCS so far. It is time consuming but very rewarding class. I found video lectures to be very interesting. Assignments are open-ended which makes them more interesting as well as time-consuming. I started with recommended tools in first couple of assignments (Weka and Abagail) but later I felt that I should move on to tools which I am more likely to use if I have to use ML techniques at my work. So being a python programmer, I moved on to sk-learn, and mdp toolbox which also worked very well for the assignments and within couple of months after course I started using the algorithms at work. Piazza was very active and everyone was helpful. Only thing I didn't like was that mid-term exam was way too long, which I don't think really serves the purpose.  This is a survey course covering pretty much all essential topics in Machine Learning. The course does not dive deep into the implementation aspect of machine learning algorithms. So set your expectation straight! The two professors are really entertaining, they did a great job in adding colors to the materials which are dry in nature. I love most of the lectures except the one on Markov Decision Process. To me, it would be more intuitive to walk through an example of value iteration before throwing tons of equations at the audience. The course did exactly the opposite which gave me a hard time. Outside the lectures, the course itself is depressing. There are four assignments in the course. They are asking serious a lot for each. I would expect to spend 100 hours for each assignment to get to the place where they expect you to be. Unfortunately it is not realistic since i am juggling between job, family and study as most of us here. The grading criteria should be better communicated, my overall impression is that the grading lacks consistency. TAs give grade based on their personal tastes.  The feedback should be more constructive and to motivate students to explore more. To me, the feedback is only a list of missing tests which are only implied in the assignment specification. I was discouraged each time after reading the TA's feedback. Overall, this is a reasonably well organized course. The materials are quite dry and TAs are expecting a lot from your assignment without telling exactly what they want you to do. This class tests your ability to work with libraries and hunt down data & process. It is very poor at teaching you Machine Learning efficiently compared to the numerous other offerings on Coursera. \n\nDon't expect to understand the material presented. That apparently isn't the goal of the course because the instructors spend their time hand-waving and the assignments have you spend time debugging against shoddy tools. You won't learn to troubleshoot the thought process or algorithms, just to fiddle at the margins with the tools provided. The people who give this course favorable reviews are very strong coders but very weak on theory and math; they pull through because they can plug & chug the coding assignments and use the crappy tools. Based on other reviews, many students thought the math in this course was challenging. It is basic freshman/sophomore calculus, but a lot of people didn't come into this program with that. If you consider yourself a math person, take Andrew Ng's classes on Stanford Engineering Everywhere. That's what real Machine Learning looks like, not the plug-and-chug coding of this course. \n\nIn this course you will get a lot of practice running algorithms that are poorly explained. I have a math / physics background and am floored by how superficial -- yet still time-consuming -- the total coverage, problem sets, and exams were. The questions involve running algorithms and interpreting output, which is about as crank-turning as I could imagine. Still, it takes a lot of time to do because the tools (except Weka) are weak and the lectures exceedingly hand-wavy. I found the book much more clear (though dry) in its explanations than the lectures. Neither were helpful on any of the assignments. Basically if you're modestly good at Java (or expertly good with Python and R ML libraries) and have a lot of time to learn to use APIs for existing ML tools, then you're fine. Perhaps that's what all CS courses are like? Strongly recommend this course, it's a great overview of the topic.  Be prepared to work your butt off.  Not much to add beyond the other reviews.  You can probably make this work as a first course (I did), but be sure to be ready for some theoretical presentations and do the work getting the abstract down to the concrete. Excellent introduction to machine learning. I don't really recommend taking this as the first class to the program though, unless you have a background in machine learning. Even then, it wasn't so much the content that makes the class difficult, rather the amount of pages you will be writing over the semester (I think I wrote somewhere between 30 and 40 pages for the semester) on top of everything else you have to do. Definitely recommend it. The instructors are awesome as well. The course is a broad survey of ML & is a nice introduction to the topic. It covers to a decent depth all the 3 learning techniques (Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning). The video lectures are very informal & at times highly entertaining. But one needs to be very attentive (& make good notes) since a lot of the questions from midterm & finals are based on the conversations between Prof. Isbell & Prof. Littman. The TA's are engaged and hold regular office hours. Prof Isbell is very active on Piazza & show tremendous patience to the almost repetitive & very annoying questions (some of them seem to simply not use the search feature before posting questions - this can be really painful for a large class like ML). The 4 assignments are meant to let the students do a detailed analysis based on the application of learning techniques, tuning hyper parameters etc on different datasets (of our choosing) & provide right justifications for all our choices. The feedback can be at times very detailed & some times not so thorough(depends on individual grading TA). It can be subjective but most of the time based on well defined rubric. Your analysis can be as independent & informal but cover what's expected. I managed to score pretty high on these (overall above 90%) with a couple of centuries. And this saved me some grace from what was nothing but disaster of a midterm...\nProf. Isbell makes it very clear(repeatedly) that he cares the least when it comes to code for all the analysis & the only thing that matters is good analysis. You can re-use existing code (cite references).\nThe exams are closed book, without any pen/paper etc and expects short concise answers. The idea is to test the understanding of the concepts on many of the topics covered in lectures.\nOverall a fantastic class & personally didn't find it as hard as advertised in discussion forums.  The teaching approach in this class seemed to be \"throw way more work/information at the students than they could possibly absorb in an attempt to push them to do more than they think they can\". \n\nWell. Okay. Mission accomplished. But the grading criterion for this course seems to be:\n\n\"Grade the students on everything we threw at them, knowing they couldn't possibly absorb it all, then give them all a massive curve at the end. \"\n\nThe problem with this is that there's no guided prioritization of focus. I learned tons in this class. But because the average in the class right now is a 67 (averages for all assignments/exams except the final are available on Canvas) neither I nor the vast majority of the students in the class know whether the gained knowledge is what we were intended to learn in the course. \n\nOf the four course objectives the one I feel the course didn't help at all with was \"To develop the basic skills necessary to pursue research in ML\". There was no guidance at all in this area. We got assigned 4 analytic assignments without any guidance in what makes a good analysis in the target domain. We were given grades on our analysis assignments with little feedback at all.  This was my favorite class that I have taken so far in the program, the professors were very knowledgeable and entertaining in the lectures. The projects were a good mix of theory and practice and gave me a very good understanding of the concepts. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, this was one tough course and semester in general.  First, I have to state that Dr. Isbell, and the TAs: Amir, Sasha, and Pushkar, were extremely helpful throughout this rough journey.  This was a crazy semester for me, and I am sure for others as well, with the hurricanes that affected us: Irma and Maria.  I actually had to complete one of the assignments while running on a portable gas-powered generator, because the electricity was out at my house due to hurricane Irma; where there's a will there's a way.  With a wife, kids, full-time job, putting up hurricane shutters at my house and my parents, being without electricity for a few days, driving all over Miami to find gasoline and propane, and taking Machine Learning for Trading along with this course, this was one hectic semester.  In the end, I miraculously earned an A in both courses.  I must say that I learned a lot in this Machine Learning course, I came into it clueless about Machine Learning, and can say that I acquired a plethora of information in the end.  Dr. Isbell and Dr. Littman cover Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning throughout this course, at a somewhat deep level, which was great.  Grading is harsh, but don't let this discourage you, just give it all you've got and do not give up.  Complete all assignments and the problem sets, and study hard for the midterm and final.  Most importantly, follow this guide: http://omscs.wikidot.com/courses:cs7641 I think this class can be informative and interesting. I say the delivery was a joke. Glossed over everything (and there is alot espcially if you don't have a background in machine learning). A different delivery format, a little more indepth (even in just a few of the areas given that it's alot of information) would make it a worthwhile course.  This class was especially difficult for me because I chose to use a dataset that was feature rich and sample poor. My suggestion to future students is to choose a dataset that is not so complicated. You could be much better off using one that had many samples and a relatively small number of features (less than 50) so that you have a better chance of understanding what exactly you are working with.  I enjoyed the course a lot, though there can be times when it is exhausting from all the time spent on the projects or going from projects to exams and back. However in the end I felt it was worthwhile and the projects gave a lot more hands-on practice with some of the methods we studied in the class. \n\nThe first half of the class can be a bit daunting in terms of the amount of material for the midterm - Supervised Learning covers a lot of lectures and most of the textbook for the class. The latter half of the class is a bit less material with respect to studying for the final. In that respect you should try to stay on or ahead of the schedule and readings so you don't feel overwhelmed getting prepared for the midterm. \n\nIn terms of the projects, the first one can feel daunting as you must select two datasets to use for this project (and reuse them for parts of later projects) and then apply a bunch of supervised learning methods to the data sets and then compare and contrast. Without giving things away, I would say on that first project try to focus on getting some plots that will help you to compare the algorithms in terms of different parameters, error rates and runtimes. Having the plots is really crucial to doing well on the assignments. As I moved on through the course I also found it helpful to write the report as I went along instead of running a ton of experiments and then trying to write it up at the end - since only the report matters for the project grades the most important thing is to start putting words (and plots) to paper, and that can help with \"analysis paralysis\". \n\nUse the software you are comfortable with for the class. Whether you prefer Python, R, or Java stick with what you like and you will probably be happier. But also the randomized optimization project has a MIMIC implementation in the ABAGAIL package (Java) and the reinforcement learning project works well with BURLAP (Java), and using those may make things easier for those projects. \n\nIf you do use java and want to get a head start on the class one activity that would be useful it watching the Weka tutorial, which walks through how to load data in Weka and use the different classifiers and classifier parameters in Weka. Learning to use either the Weka CLI or APIs to programmatically run classifiers is also helpful as you can use that to run a series of experiments to see how tuning parameters in the learning algorithms impacts the results. \n\nFinally believe Charles when he says not to panic on the midterm results. The mean on our midterm was around 50/100 but that corresponded to the equivalent of an A, and the B range was 20-30 points and up. So even if you feel bad about the midterm don't give up, submit all the projects and you should end up okay.  This course was very challenging because there is a lot of material to get through in a short amount of time. The homework assignments are long to implement and unclear - at first - what the professor is looking for in a good grade. The class gives you a taste of what it might mean to implement machine learning algo in real life - the frustration and uncertainty. If you stick with the course, you will be rewarded! I thought about quitting half-way through the class and received a C on the first homework BUT ended up with an A in the final course. \n\nThere are opportunities for \"extra credit\", where you can show that you have done extra work and get potential lift points if you're in between grades - it is not clear how this is done but it worked to my benefit. The class is very open about sharing algorithms (but not write ups) and discussion boards are full of people exchanging ideas and helping students that are stuck. Very collaborative class and it promotes open sources and sharing in the CS community. Also, I appreciated peer feedback because then I could see how other approached the same question & with different languages. \n\nThis class took over my life for a few months but I am a stronger technical person as a result. Recommend that you only take one course when Machine Learning is involved. Good luck! I took this class working full time I agree that \"applied ML\" would be a better suiting title for this class. The Udacity videos are fun to watch and sufficient to introduce students into the topics discussed. My only concern about this class was the responsiveness of the prof or TAs on Piazza. I happened to get seriously ill at the start of the semester (almost 1 month of hospital treatment and reconvalescence). I approached the Office of the Dean of Students, they checked the supporting medical docs and forwarded my absence request to the prof. SImulataneouslY I made a private post on Piazza, asking for an extension (2 wks) of a P1 (a deadline had passed before). A TA asked me to fwd a message from the Office of the Dean of Students with a statement that after I do this, they would approve my extension. I did what I was asked for and nobody replied anymore. Tried to remind them, tried to escalate to the prof., no reply. I ended up withdrawing from the course (1st time in the OMSCS, after 7 courses passed with As). One of the best class on OMSCS that I've had. Something to keep in mind is that this class is a survey class. It goes over on a high level the various major topics pertaining to Machine Learning but if you want to dive in deep there are other classes like Reinforcement Learning itself. The projects are a great way to learn more about how things really work and I do highly recommend that you steal code for this class rather than writing it from scratch (yes this is allowed and encouraged for this class). It'll save you a lot of time and gives you more time to play around and write your actual analysis (which is basically the entire score for your projects).\n\nThe lectures are great for me at least, but I do know of a few people who did not like the banter between the two professors. The extra readings, while not necessary, I believe is a great supplement to the lectures. Do read them to expand your understanding but is not really needed for the tests. All in all, a great class! Machine Learning is a vast discipline. This course surveys techniques in Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. There are only 4 assignments so you have several weeks to do each, but each one covers broad regions of the ML landscape. Part of the difficulty of each assignment is figuring out what is most important to include in your writeup. This seems to be deliberate. Guidelines are given regarding grading, but they don't tell you exactly what you need to do to get a high score. This frustrates some people, but I think it's reasonable because this is grad school, not undergrad, and we need to develop the ability to do independent research and determine on our own what is important, what questions to ask, how to get answers to those questions, etc. If we can't do those things we'll never be able to discover or invent something new. \n\nYou are free to write your code in whatever language you choose. Mostly you'll choose a library with the ML algorithms you need instead of writing everything from scratch (which would require a superhuman effort). Python and scikit-learn are popular as is Weka and other Java libraries. \n\nThis course isn't about becoming an expert in ML (that would be impossible in 1 semester). This course offers a broad view of the ML landscape and helps you learn how to approach ML topics so you can identify areas of interest and continue to build your skills beyond this course. VERY time-consuming and open-ended course but you learn a lot. I felt that this course was a bit too open-ended at times. \n\nThe lectures are entertaining and informative. \n\nThe assignments are based around performing a series of expiriments and then performing analysis on those expiriments. Neither the lectures nor the assignment instructions go into any real discussion on how to implement the expiriments, you are mostly on your own in that regard. You need to choose what tool or software package to use (WEKA, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, R, SciKit, etc. ) as well as what algorithms and parameters to use in many cases. You are given very little direction on how to perform the expiriments, so they typically take a great deal of time to setup. You are given zero points for implementing the actual expiriment, the grade is based entirely on your analysis of your results. That said, as long as you answer all the questions the assignment poses, the grading tended to be fair. Piazza is your friend here as other students are a good source for what direction to go or not to go for each assignment. \n\nThe exams were also very open-ended and you aren't given much direction on what to study. \n\nOverall if you do all of the assignments, and do more than just watch the lectures and read the book to study you should manage at least a B.  7641 is a rewarding and difficult class. The lectures, tests and projects all demand your attention. The projects IMO were a mixed-bag: it\u2019s an opportunity to apply what you learn in class but they\u2019re quite tedious to write. I wish I appreciated the thoroughness the graders were expecting ahead of time. My first project answered all of the questions that were asked of us but because I didn\u2019t check-off enough boxes on some hidden grading rubric, I got one of the worst grades I\u2019ve ever gotten and spent the rest of the semester trying to get back into a good state. When the prof says that the code doesn\u2019t matter and it\u2019s all about the write-up, he really means it. Challenging and rewarding course. The lectures are engaging and Prof Isbell is active on piazza. I came in with experience using python for supervised learning problems at work, and for some unsupervised problems as well, but the optimization and reinforcement learning sections were completely new to me. I learned so much through the readings and lectures, but the assignments really solidified my knowledge. Workload varied for me depending on whether it was a week where the assignment was due or not -- the weeks where an assignment was due on the weekend, I would spend at least 2 hours on it per day during the week, and then all of saturday and most (if not all) of sunday on it too. This course was a lot of work, even after I had prepared considerably for it. The lectures were very theoretical and give very little advice for implementation of algorithms. It would have been helpful to have more resources on that available. Know Python, Java, R or matlab. I found the TA's difficult to understand during office hours, although that partly could be attributed to poor sound quality. There were several plots they were looking for in each project that weren't obivous until grading, although by the last one you can start to guess what they're looking for. The exams were challenging. I do feel like I learned a lot, and somehow managed to get an A. The curve will be your friend. Choose data that is large enough to have some diversity but small enough that runtimes will stay at the level of several minutes for each implementation. [ 1000-10, 000 observations] Very challenging class but incredibly rewarding. One of my favourite classes ever, you will be exposed to roughly a dozen machine learning algorithms. \n\nThe first half of the class is the most difficult. Understanding the math, ideas, requirements for papers and midterm can be a little discouraging. The second half proved to be much easier and even more interesting. I was ready to drop the class at the midpoint but ended up finishing with a top mark. \n\nAt the start of the course you have choose 2 datasets which is the basis of all your work and papers. The problem is that course does not explain what qualifies as a good dataset to study. Its a tradeoff between the training time, sample size and the number of dimensions. To little data and there is no difference between the various algorithms. Too much data and it will take a long time to run your programs. My first dataset was too simple and the second didn't have enough data to train - given the number of inputs (dimensions). I would seek clarification before finalizing the dataset choice as the idea is to compare all the algorithms on the same dataset. \n\nThe instructors are highly entertaining and seasoned experts in their field. The class was overall very fun and programming is not too bad (even for a non-CS student). Projects are difficult and time consuming. Professor Isbell does not care about using other people's codes as long as they are cited.. take advantage of this and take the extra time on your research and writeup. Both midterm and final exams are difficult. The midterm exam in particular is designed not to be finished so don't worry if you didn't do well. Professor Isbell really cares about \"synthesising\" the learned material. Make sure to review the lectures. I did above average on both exams and managed an A by reviewing the lectures two to three times (despite not reading any reading material). Also, do not procrastinate... class starts off slow, but quickly accelerates and reaches a work-load peak during assignment 2, midterm, and assignment 3. You should be fine as long as you put in the time. In summary, PUT IN THE TIME AND DO NOT GIVE UP. Fighting for an A in this class is extremely stressful but I did earn one in the end. I had heard great things about learning from Dr. Isbell and I was not disappointed in the least. It was an honor to learn from him and Dr. Littman. These professors genuinely care about how well and deeply their students learn. If you take this course you will learn a lot and if you want good grades on the assignments, you will work very hard. Each of the 4 project assignments took me 35-40 hours. My advice is to start on every assignment early and truly learn from the feedback the TAs give you on them. The assignments are pretty open-ended and they want you to do more than the listed requirements but also do it concisely, so a lot of your time on the assignments will be editing and making sure you cut out fluff and use your words wisely. Also do all the problem sets they make available. You'll want to get started on these early too so after discussing solutions on Piazza, you can fully understand the answers before the midterm and final exams. Also, don't use this class to learn an obscure tool. Use the tool most of the class uses because the instructors don't care about which tool you use and you won't earn extra points for using something unusual or poorly documented. The benefit of using what most students use for each assignment is that you can spend less time implementing the work and more time writing your analysis which is almost all they care about. Tools more common among your fellow classmates will have more troubleshooting solutions on Piazza. This was my 5th course in the program and it was probably the hardest I've ever worked for an A in a class but now my brain is packed full of knowledge about Machine Learning and I look forward to taking Reinforcement Learning, especially because it's taught by the same professors.  I think all the previous reviews adequately capture the difficulty of this course. I highly recommend that anyone taking this course currently at least take a look at my open source assignment 4 code. Me and several other students spent a lot of time working on it and I hope it will help others taking the course as well: https://github. com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4 Great class. It's more on the application side than the theory side, which is not quite my preference, but allows the class to cover a very wide variety of algorithms. There's a ton of work, so be very disciplined about time management. I also encourage the use of a stock dataset for your first assignment. You don't want to be spend huge amounts of time wrangling your data into the proper format before you have a chance to see how some of the tools work.  This is a great class and I learned a ton. The lectures are highly entertaining. I enjoyed that they let you choose your own data and analysis toolsets, though it made it a bit harder to get help with problems on the forums sometimes. I've rated it as difficult, but its probably more fair to call it massively time consuming. The projects are long; for me it took a couple of weeks to complete each. To do over, I would get a jump start on the lectures before class begins, and get familiar with the toolsets, so i could start the first project early. The class would have been more enjoyable with a bit less workload, perhaps covering a bit less material. There were quite a few grading issues, and at times, things seemed a bit disorganized. But overall, an excellent class.  Over all, I really enjoyed this class. Professors Isbell and Littman made the lectures very informative and entertaining. The amount of information and the rate at which you are exposed to it can be a bit overwhelming. I found the midterm and final to be challenging and long. The supplemental readings provided essential additional details for success on the exams. \n \nI agree with previous comments that all four assignments were unnecessarily long. Choosing good data sets is a must. I would recommend choosing data that you are either very familiar with or that can be easily understood and visualized (this would have helped me get a better understanding of what the algorithms were doing). I used Matlab to complete all but one assignment. I used Java on the other assignment b/c it was the only place I could find an implementation of MIMIC. I have no previous Java experience, but was able to cobble together enough of it to complete the assignment.  Best course I've ever taken. Difficult, but not overwhelmingly so. The worst part is the workload -- it's ungodly, and I have to assume this is a weeder course. This course offered a lot of benefit, but I still don't think that it justified the work load. As mentioned above, research projects are very long reports, experiments take very long to run, and the assignments are the worst combination of loose-definition and high-expectation one could imagine. You choose your own tools, data, analysis, and pretty much everything, but it's still difficult to hit everything on the grading syllabus. Lecture videos are very entertaining and tied well into the assignments. Exams, I felt, did an excellent job of testing our 'synthesis of the material', as Prof. Isbell would put it. I hope the rest of my OMSCS courses are like this one, but with less busy work.  This is the stalwart of the Curly/Smoov two-fer in the ML specialization. Many people are initially turned off by the open-ended nature of the class, but that's really the genius of it - to encourage intellectual exploration that would otherwise not happen if a clear and concise rubric was given to be followed.\n\nI had completed ML4T and RL previously, and those really helped with the course - particularly in understanding the grading style of the projects and with the RL parts of the course. Though having done only ML4T would have been more than sufficient in a successful experience in ML.\n\nStart on the projects on the day that they are assigned, and attending office hours, are key to succeeding in the projects. The exams are difficult and require a depth and breadth of understanding the material - there's no getting cute around that.\n\nOverall, an excellent class that is well designed and the student definitely gets as much as he puts into the class.\n This class will challenge you and require a lot of time spent finding data, training models, and writing reports. It's all worth the effort because there's so much rich content to learn. Prepare to work hard and long hours.  Difficult but rewarding. There will be times especially at the beginning of the class when you will feel totally lost. But\ndont let go and you will see the results. Brush yup on statistics (I found intro to statistics on udacity to be especially\nhelpful). Participate in Piazza and Hipchat and discuss topics with fellow classmates. A major part of the learning of\nthis class is from peers. Do not try to go solo. The assignments are very open ended and gives a lot of room to be \ncreative. Focus more on the analysis and why you are seeing the results instead of what. Grading is liberal as this is\ndifficult course.  This course is almost perfect and 'almost' just because perfect does not exist:) Lectures are amazing, detailed and engaging. The structure of the material presentation is what I consider as best - starting with the main idea(s) and presenting it in a simple (but not primitive) and memorable way and then diving into details (technical and rigourous) and then recaping what you've learnt. The level is very good and assignments allow you to make the course as difficult as you want. Some suggestions: To students - 1) follow the assignment rubric carefully, if it says do kurtosis analysis - do it (it's actually not that optional as you might think). If you do a reasonable analysis following rubric fully, you can be almost sure you'll get more than 90% and all the rest will depend on the amount and quality of your analysis. 2) Do all optional work you are given (reviewing assignments, problem sets, etc. ) It will help understand the material and get a better grade. 3) If you want to really succeed on the exams (like solving almost all problems) and it is your 1st ML course, then doing lectures and homework assignments most probably won't be enough. Read the BOOK s and solve some additional problems from other sources. To Profs: 1) it would be great to make problem sets a little closer to the type of questions students will see on the exam (both questions and problems), I felt that they were slightly disconnected sometimes. 2) It would be better to provide more problems in each problem set (even if they are optional). 3) It would be good to see not only midterm exam explained by Profs, but also Final - it is a really important educational piece to know what you did right/wrong on the exam and why.  This class is well done. The lectures are done well and provide good explanation. My one suggestion for improvement would be for the teachers to talk about methods that are successful for solving ML problems in the real world. Midterm was extremely difficult. Make sure to study basic equations on both midterm and final. I find this to be a very hard, but also very rewarding course. The professors put together some well-written, very entertaining lectures. The class covers a wide swathe of the machine learning spectrum. The lectures themselves don't get too deep, but they do a good job of familiarizing you with a lot of concepts. \n\nThere is quite a bit of supplemental reading, both with the primary text and several other papers. Not so much as AOS had, but still a fair amount. \n\nProfessor Isbell and the TAs are pretty responsive on Piazza. Elijah has been very active and helpful in particular. \n\nThe bulk of the difficulty comes with the projects. They are very open ended: you can use whatever data sets or framework you want to complete them. All of the coding and experimentation is just a set up for the analysis you write, which is the real centerpiece of a project. Writing a good analysis requires really understanding what is going on and will require a fair amount of independent research, above and beyond what the lectures and supplemental reading provide. It's tough, but I find that it gives a thorough understanding of the area. For me each of the projects has taken around 50-60 hours to complete. They come at a two to three week cadence. Budget your time appropriately. \n\nFor some of the projects it is likely that you will end up using ABAGAIL, which is maintained by Pushkar. It's pretty solid, although it has some blemishes. My only complaint with it is that there are standing bugs in it which are fixed by several-month-old pull requests. You can go and find these yourself, but they really should be merged. \n\nI've only had the midterm so far, and I must admit it is probably one of the hardest I've ever had. It is intentionally hard. My understanding is not that it is meant to weed people out, but to separate the truly outstanding students. \n\nOverall, if you like machine learning and you're willing to take on a tough course, I highly recommend this one.  This is a challenging course. The first few lectures on Supervised learning may be easy but the it gets tougher as the course progresses. Don't make a mistake of taking it lightly after watching a few lectures. Try to watch the lectures early and review the reading materials. Assignments are key to this course. Start them very early. Spend at least a week in writing report. I made a mistake of focusing more on code instead of the reports and inferences. While writing reports, read the instructions, read the piazza posts and watch the office hours to know what type of graphs and inferences are needed. You may feel that you have done very bad in the course but you are more likely to get an A at the end.  In short, I echo the comments of many reviews here that the content was excellent and the course is challenging.\n\nThe longer version ...\nThere are three components I'll comment on individually: lectures, exams, and assignments. \n* Lectures - Most people agree that these are excellent. Watch a few of them and you'll see the dynamic between professors Isbell and Littman. The order of material, the quizzes, and the examples are all generally good as well.\n\n* Exams - A midterm and a final, which only addressed material since the midterm. The exams were straightforward, covered a nice breadth of material, and were appropriately difficult. My only criticism is that the midterm had way more content than time to answer it. The final did not have that problem. \n\n* Assignments - Bittersweet (for me at least). Each of the four was relevant, rewarding, and quite time-consuming. My two main criticisms are 1) you are asked to think deeply on a topic you are presently learning, which, for me, is tough; and 2) the assignments are broadly and loosely scoped. Personally, I finished every assignment feeling as though I learned a ton, but each grade reflected just the opposite. More structure in the assignments would have helped me focus on what I needed to learn rather than waste time trying to figure out what the TA wants me to address.\n\nOverall: Excellent material that I've been wanting to learn the foundations of for a while. The instruction was great. I just wish the assignments were more structured.", 
    "CS-7642": " RL is tough but fun. The lecture videos were produced a couple of year ago. thanks to the efforts of DeepMind and OpenAI folks, quite a few foundational theories / assumptions in our lectures are no longer sufficient nor accurate enough. They have just added a new assignment with OpenAI and will be updating the readings to reflect the fast changing industry. Lectures are math heavy but you do learn a lot. Taking this in summer might be a bad idea, unless weekly assignment and cramming an exam within a week is your ideal summer. TAs office hours are not really helpful (except the hands-on sessions) and profs are no-shows; you will need discipline and motivation to finish the course and be active in reaching out to TA and Piazza for help. This was a extremely difficult class when I took it. The fact that they did not truncate it for summer makes it even more difficult, but I am glad they chose to do it that way. \n\nNow, project two was a real killer. There was very minimal guidance and connection to class material. It was drop dead hard. Though the TA stepped in and helped a week before it's due, it was too late for many of us. \n\nProject 3 was hard too, but more manageable. \n\nThe only saving grace was that grading was somewhat lenient. I ended up overkill the class, but I was so stressed out most of the time mainly because of project 2. But at the end I learned a lot, so it was worth it. Excellent course with interesting topics. The TA's were amazing; highly responsive and genuinely trying to improve the class. There was very little interaction with the professor but the ta's made up for it in my opinion. The lectures were interesting and well-done. Grade based on both homeworks and projects, as well as a final; the homeworks and projects were interesting and effective teaching tools, but didn't always correspond to well to the lectures. Time commitment was fairly high especially for a summer class, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the field. I have mixed feelings about this course. On the one hand it covers interesting material, and had one of my favorite projects in my academic career where we taught an AI agent to learn to solve a scenario on the OpenAI Gym. On the other hand I detest academic papers and this course puts a HEAVY emphasis on them. \n\nIn many ways this course felt catered to people who are pursuing careers in academia and not toward people who want to gain knowledge to solve real world problems, my assumption is most OMS students fall in the later. Two of the projects involved recreating results from academic papers. In addition, it is recommended that students read through 22 academic papers throughout the course. While you can survive the course without reading most of the academic papers, it shows where the focus is. \n\nHomework felt completely unrelated to lecture material, the time needed to do homework assignments varied wildly and some of the homework and project timelines were unrealistic unless you can stay way ahead of schedule. \n\nOverall, the course felt in some ways like a disservice to the material it covers. The course material is interesting and can be used to solve very cool problems like those seen on OpenAI, however it only spent a small portion of the time solving interesting problems. Very deceptive course. Most of the materials for the course is from academic papers. The lectures do no justice in explaining the papers or setting the students up for success. The poor jokes of the professors make it even worse. The 3 projects in this course are mostly based on academic papers, which you have to read and replicated without much help. The TAs were kind enough to help on few of the homeworks and projects. Extremely hard final. I did take this course after taking ML (scoring an A in it). Personally I learned more from ML4T than ML and RL combined. Though the content taught in this course is interesting, there is not much practical applications possible (not a popular field at the moment). It would be better to take BD4H instead of RL as it will give you some hands-on experience for working in the industry. Great course. TA group is the best I've had after 3 semesters. \nLectures average 1-2 hours a week. 2 weeks were high at 3. 5ish\nPapers are ~25 in total. Most are 6-7 pages. Some are more. None are less. It's a lot, but not that bad compared to some other courses (looking at you AOS... ). They connect very well to the lectures. \n\n3 projects (15% each). 6 home works (5% each). 1 final (25%). \n\nIt's a ton of work for the summer. It's a grind with something due every week. Even if you're ahead you'll get behind with the projects. You should definitely take ML before this. If not, you're in for a party. Highly recommend folks getting familiar with Barto and Sutton's book (it's free on Sutton's website), David Silver's RL lectures (YouTube), and numpy (vectorization for the win). \n\nHW 1-4, Project 1-2, and the final are fair and very related to the content (project 2 is awesome). HW 5-6 and Project 3 need to be reworked. HWs 5-6 are relatively easy, but are 'eh. ' Project 3 is a massive step up in complexity with little resources available if you don't 'get it. ' They were such an adrenaline kill after how great project 2 was. It sounds like the TAs are going to review and revamp. \n\nIsbell was absent, which was not a surprise due to past reviews. He was on piazza day 1, and that's essentially it. He missed the one office hour he was going to attend due to a storm. \n\nTAs were able to get Michael Littman on a special office hours, which was awesome. Last semester they got Richard Sutton. Littman is a genius, and it was an awesome experience. \n\nOne note, after reading some negative reviews, Michael Littman is a professor at Brown. He doesn't have access to GA Tech systems (Piazza). Fine to down vote the course for Isbell not showing up, but it's ignorant to down vote for a Browns prof not being active at GA Tech. \n\nTAs are knowledgeable. They will answer your questions. They sometimes need to review specifics (if referencing a paper). You will not find a better group of TAs. This was a fantastic class; a great follow-up to Machine Learning (7641). Dr. Isbell and Dr. Littman return to dive into the details of the field of reinforcement learning in a fun and engaging way. Fall 2016 upgraded the difficulty level of this class both homework-wise and project-wise, in addition to adding a final exam. There was a homework every week or two that usually took under an hour to complete, and three projects throughout the semester that took 40+ hours to complete. Two of those projects were replicating paper results, and the other project was actually implementing a RL algorithm to play a video game to land a spaceship. This was a pretty cool class and definitely worth taking, but don't expect it to be any easier than ML. I earned my first B in this course but I can rightly kick myself for it. When I recommend starting every project ASAP, please listen to avoid my mistakes. You might ace all the homeworks like me but they mean little (only 30% of your grade). The projects are worth the most (45%) and they take a LOOONG time to get right. First, it takes a long time to understand how to implement them. Then you have to test them, which being machine learning, also takes a long time. Then once you know they work, you need to run them for long periods of time to get the results you need for the analysis. Please don't wait. The analysis isn't bad for each project (only 5 pages each) but obviously you want your code to work properly first. I hate the fact that they didn't release them all at once. I really would have liked working ahead. They only give you 2 weeks for each project and that's a shame. Overall, the course was incredibly interesting and well taught. The TA's were very responsive and helpful. This was a great class but of the 6 courses I've taken so far, this one penalizes you the most for waiting on projects. Just don't do it. As others have mentioned, the workload was very high over the summer. I believe there were only 2 projects for Summer 2016 - we had 3 projects, 6 homeworks, and a final for Summer 2017. This meant something was due every week, with projects due every 3 weeks. \n\nI'd say this course in the summer is at least as much work as ML in a full semester, if not more. I wish I had taken it in a full semester, as even doubled up with another class I think the slower pace for the projects would have been extremely helpful. \n\nRegarding the course overall, I liked it, but not as much as I was expecting to. The lectures were great, the volume of expected readings was overwhelming, and I have mixed feelings about the projects. I really enjoyed the second project (Lunar Lander), where we used cutting-edge RL techniques to solve an OpenAI Gym problem. The first and third projects were both replicating results from papers, and I found I don't enjoy that very much. I think it's a valuable skill to have, but the emphasis was too heavy on it. My ideal would be to keep the first project as a paper replication project, but replace the third project with one similar to the second (where we read papers to learn the techniques and apply them to solve a challenging problem). I actually quite enjoyed the material the third project focused on. \n\nI also didn't really see the point of submitting both a 3-page paper and a 5-minute recorded presentation (with an exception for project 2, where it was neat to be able to show videos of my agent playing Lunar Lander). I think this is a common complaint, as the TAs polled the class on our preferred submission format, so I think this might change going forward. \n\nOne last thing, Dr. Isbell was almost completely absent from Piazza (I knew from reviews here to expect this, but it's a big departure from ML). The TA team was exceptional and did a great job of running the course, especially Miguel and Tim, but I wish Dr. Isbell was more active. I loved this course. The lectures were great - informative and engaging and the projects, which were rarely super hard, helped give you some subtle insights into the course content that I don't think you could have gotten any other way. I wish there were more courses on this... I'd take them in a heartbeat. The content was very interesting and the TAs were very accommodating. \nThe weekly projects we very light compared to the final project, but overall, the course is great. There were a lot of reading materials, but I learned a lot about Reinforcement learning! I did my undergrad in Computer Science. I never experienced a course as rigor as RL. TA's were great and assignments, Home Works were really challenging. For Projects we are expected to understand research Papers and implement some sections. In that process you will learn a lot and get good understanding of the Subject. \nFor Project -1 we implemented a Sutton Paper on TD(lamdba). Taught in TD and friends\nProject -2 A paper published by Google Brain on DQN (We solved a problem in openAI using this paper. ). Taught in Function Approximation Lectures \nProject -3 - Markov Games (Q-learning, friend and foe Q-learning, Correlated Equilibrium ). Taught in last part of Markov Games and Game Theory. \n\nI disagree with some of the post that says there is no link between course content and projects. \n\nIsbell and Michel did a great job in making the course content simpler to understand. \n\nKudos to TA's for guest lecture with Richard Sutton (Father of Modern RL). This was a great class - the return of pair lecturing with Smoov & Curly, an interesting subject, and a far lower workload than ML (as advertised). The big thing to keep in mind is that there is an easy way and a hard way to complete the assignments. If you find yourself spending more than a few hours on a problem, you're doing it the hard way. Go back to the lectures & the assigned readings, and think about how you would solve the problem without any RL tools. I learned quite a bit in this class, but it is a challenging course. If you want to deep dive into a key aspect of Machine Learning, this class is for you. My biggest concern is that the professors were not around for the class, it was entirely run by the TA's. I wish they would update the content to be less on academic papers and more on the use of the latest RL libraries (ie DQN) / applications. This class is deceptive.  The homeworks (6) are disproportionately easy, but the projects (at least two of them) require some advanced skills -- dissecting research papers by academic leaders in the field.  Probably best to be taken in second year after you've developed some organizational discipline and should definitely be taken with a lighter-workload partner class or as a solo class.  The final is extremely challenging.  Be prepared to do a LOT of outside reading, be involved in Slack and on Piazza, and you will learn a lot. I loved the material, lectures and final project. Assignments were a mixed bag for me. communication on piazza was sorely lacking. Student study group a life saver.  Do NOT walk into this class thinking it will be easier than ML. \n\nThe midterm project was highly interesting; the midterm itself was cake (so long as you took good notes and studied). \n\nThe homeworks.... can be difficult. Most of them have a 'trick', and if you dont know this trick you will spend hours looking for answers. I had a hard time seeing how some of them related to the lecture for that week, so at times I wondered why I was doing them (outside of the grade earned). There are SEVERAL homeworks too (expect 1 a week if a project or test is not due that week), so its pretty much an unrelenting stream of work. \n\nThe professor himself is pretty awesome though, and the TAs are fabulous and very helpful. \n\nThe class is billed as much easier than ML, but make no mistake - this is far from reality. Approach this course like you did with ML (prepare to dig in to the material and set aside a massive chunk of time) and you should be more or less fine. \n\nTake this course, but be prepared.  The material is dense and complex, with a lot of math (like ML). The assignments are difficult to get good grades on because they are evaluated using a lot of edge cases. It's probably overall less work than ML but, in my opinion, far more coding intensive because there are no papers for most of the course, just difficult programming projects that have to not only output the right answers but do it fast (or slow) enough.  This course is a survey on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making techniques. There are weekly assigned lectures and readings (papers provided by the instructor). \n\nOn Summer, an assignment was due every week, I'd say their goal was assessing that the students understood concepts explained on the lectures. You do not submit code, only results, so you could solve them with Java, Python, Excel, pencil and paper. There's an auto grader available! Some assignments were more interesting than others. \n\nIn Summer we only had one final exam (25 true/false questions, and you had to explain your answer). It was hard to cram all that information in one week (assuming you started to study once you submitted the final project). It seems that in full semesters, a midterm was also part of the evaluation, that would have made the load more manageable. \n\nFor both projects assigned (midterm and final project) we had to replicate the results of published RL papers. We had to explain about our implementation, the assumptions we made, the difficulties we had, etc. You can use any language/library since code was not submitted, only the report and a 3-minute video presentation. You learn a LOT doing that. Start working as soon as you can in the projects! \n\nAt the end, the grading was generous, since people who were on the C (70-80%) or B (80-90%) brackets, ended up earning the upper grade (B, A, respectively)\n\nI highly recommend this course if you are interested on the topic. You can go as deep as you want in the material. The resources shared by the instructor are gold, and will give you many ideas for future work or research.  Loved this course! Miguel (head TA) was awesome and held additional hands on sessions to help us with the projects and assignments. Fellow students were also very engaged and willing to walk each other through examples to better understand the concepts. The course was condensed for the summer and we only had a week to do the projects. I had to take days off from work for the last two projects and pulled an all-nighter to get the second one done. For the second project, you pretty much have to learn and apply DQN (not covered in the lectures or the readings at all) in order to get it to work. It was worth it though. This class prepares you to follow recent developments in reinforcement learning and is by far the most interesting class I have ever taken. I loved the subject matter more than anything else. It's a really fascinating field. Very little participation by Prof Isbell, but the TAs were incredibly enthusiastic, involved, and had considerable knowledge of the subject. \n\nThe videos are well done. They're a bit chatty though as I learned going back through them for the final trying to take notes. I liked the blend of theoretical and practical, but if math isn't your think, the theoretical part is pretty dense. \n\nThe workload is quite high in the summer. After the first week, there's a homework (6 of them), project (3), or test (the final) due every Monday. I. e., [hw, hw, project]*3 + final. There are probably 20+ hours of lectures and 20+ papers. I don't think anyone really read all the papers in depth and most fell behind on the videos. We were always struggling to keep up with graded assignments. The second project (lunar lander) also required reading unassigned material (almost everyone who was successful used DQN, which wasn't explicitly covered). You should aim to get the two homeworks done in a week and leave yourself two weeks for the project, if you're taking it in the summer. The extra weeks in a regular semester would make a very big difference in the pace. You could do one hw per week and have two weeks for the project. \n\nPersonally, I'd prefer to see the course a little less project-oriented and split the final into a mid-term plus a final. That would force folks to stay up with the material and keep it up from being a semester of projects followed by a week of cramming. You could remove a project or make them a little easier. For instance, I would provide the soccer environment for project 3 and maybe give hints on some hyperparameters for the lunar lander project -- aspects of the projects that don't really have pedagogical value. \n\nIt's a lot of work, but you'll learn a lot and feel like you accomplished something. The course is very good, however the hw/assignments are not good at all. The hw/assignments did not relate to what we learned. \n\nOn the other hand, the lectures were amazing. I learn a lot ( theoretically ). If there were more application related hw/assignments it would have been perfect.  In continuation to my below post..... \n\nMiguel and Tim rocked throughout undoubtedly!! Apart from that.... \n\nThings that I did not like about TAs is that they did not play any role in guiding the folks into the right direction or helping them out in understanding the concepts better. \nOffice Hours were not help at all and, I gained nothing from those, they laughed at queries asked by people and what not, did not discuss the prior submitted assignments as if the folks who did not get those right, will get to know about their mistakes eventually (didn't allow us to share anything on piazza regarding submitted assignments post deadlines as well). At one point I really thought, if you know it then you got it else drop the class and that was the worst feeling ever. \n\nNote: I have seen TAs doing better and great job in order to help folks and in making understand assignments better in other courses e. g. CV (King Pedro rocks!!). \nFelt like Miguel, Tim and Chris were the only TAs who were proactively participating and other TAs were nothing more than project graders. \n\nI read somewhere in below comments that TAs were as busy as we were but I don't understand what made TAs busier than us as Hws were autograded and only thing that TAs were busy with Project grades (as well finals and HW5) and just one office hour per week (ignoring the 2-3 hands on session given by Miguel/Chris). Moreover, that was part of their job to support all these activities. \n\n6 TAs joining same Office hour per week, could not understand that thing. I think that was waste of time for most of them as mostly Miguel and Tim drove those oHs and they could have divided the hands on and query sessions among themselves and could have provided more value to the folks like me. \n\nIn the end, I am satisfied with what I learned from this course but if it were not for my peers, I would not have made it this far in this course. \n\nHappy Reinforcement Learning!! For me, this was neither an \"easy\" nor a CCA-like (see the reviews if you don't know) class. It was somewhat challenging, but managable. I took it over the summer and was disappointed that Dr. Isbell was not very interactive in the class... the TAs ran the show daily/weekly. They were extremely helpful and responsive (above average). As always, start everything early. There were two projects and a single (final) exam over the summer, but I understand the 'regular' semesters have had a 3rd project and an extra exam. New developments for the summer: The class was language agnostic and you didn't have to submit code... just auto-graded for the weekly assignments. No code submission for the projects... just a report and video presentation. Some of my grades on the projects and exam were definitely not that great, but overall grading was fair given the class changes and compressed summer schedule. I'd say it's a must-take if you're interested in RL. There's a ton of reading, though, and the lectures are fairly dense... not a class you can run the videos on 2x the first time through! This was my first course, hence, I don't have any reference to compare with. I really liked the course and has definitely given me knowledge required to do further research in application of RL. The most difficult part was learning Game theory. The lectures are really informative. I liked the conversational style of teaching. You may also have to listen David Silver's lecture to get a better understanding of certain topics. Piazza and Slack were really active. If it was not for slack and piazza, I don't know if I would have completed the last project. The final exam was really difficult. Overall i really enjoyed the course and I am all eager to apply RL at work. Professor Isbell and Littman did another excellent job with this course. The lectures were extremely engaging and the material was very interesting. In my opinion this course is a good bit easier than Machine Learning. The projects were very effective (the second one is quite challenging). For the summer semester there was only a final (25 T/F) which was not too difficult. \n\nThe reason I only \"Liked\" this course is because some of the assignments are fairly weak. While I appreciated not having to spend excessive amounts of time on them (a few took approximately 30 minutes), they did not always relate back clearly to the course material. However even with that, I would highly recommend this course.  Great course with interesting and cutting edge material. Professors are passionate about material in the lectures and it shows, but the lectures can be hard to follow as the are very math and theory heavy. Too many readings, which do not necessarily support the lectures of hw/projects at the time. As others have said, HW assignments are not that useful to understanding the material. 2 of the 3 projects are reproducing published research results, while the other is applying what you've learned to an OpenAI environment, which to me was much more interesting and useful. I would like to see more applied assignments like project 2. \n\nA little too much material to cover in a summer semester. Projects 2 and 3 take several weeks at the least, but in summer something is due every week. HWs seem like an annoyance to get past to get started on the projects (start early!) \n\nTAs this semester were great, very active on piazza and recommended or provided extra materials for help. Great course. Cutting edge concepts. Literally piazza and TA's were godsend. \n\nWhile I liked the conversational video lectures, they were really hard to correlate them to the home works and projects. Once I reached project 2, I literally stopped watching lecture videos and started youtube-ing Peter Norvig classes on Reinforcement learning. \n\nFinals were brutal. Honestly I was clueless about at least 5 questions, like literally no idea what they were talking about. I found the workload to be pretty high in Reinforcement Learning @ summer. I took ML last semester. and I had one Master of Mathematics. I took 30+ and almost 40 hours for project 2 and project 3. You need run some jobs. and it may take a one day, sometimes two days. Also, you need better computer with GPU. Please buy a computer with GPU. It really helps a lots. \n\nAlso there are lots of papers need read. Some video I did not understand, I watched David Silver (youtube version RL Course by David Silver) or Andrew Ng (youtube version from lesson 16 to lesson 20) first. then watch video again. it helps a lot. But for summer, it was short time. and if you had full time job. I think you need sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 AM for paper and video. and get up at 7:00 AM for job from Monday to Friday. and no weekends, because you need finish your HWs or Projects every weeks. So i think no life if you plan to take this course at summer. BTW, TA is best. helpful and very great. This is a great course with a lot of good theory, but is still very abstract. A few more practical projects/HW could be beneficial for the course. It's language agnostic, which is great (Java and Python most common - but beware of buggy RL packages!). Some assignments can even be done with pen & paper - it's pure math and probability. \n\nThe two course projects were the places where you actually learn a ton! You read academic papers thoroughly and try to reproduce results from them. So, you're reading the cutting edge research that is being published. I wish there were more such courses. But some people may not like this overly academic scenario. It is likely that subsequent semesters will have more paper-reproduction projects and less MS-style homework assignments. \n\nFinally, this course doesn't have as much instructor involvement as ML does. But our TAs Miguel and Tim were very responsive.  Good course, that delves into one part from 7641 deep. Many fun assignments, especially the one that uses Open AI gym. Lots of paper to read that gives a pretty good insight into the workings are reinforcement learning. Overall a fun, medium difficulty level course I'm pretty torn on this class. The subject matter is fascinating, but I didn't love the way the course was taught. Many of the videos were too theoretical for my taste (focus on things like algorithm convergence, etc), though as usual the instructors make a great team and are entertaining. There was a strong focus on technical papers (a large percentage the instructor's own), and I generally find them an awful way to learn new concepts. The 1st and 3rd projects were replicating results from old papers, which was tedious and dull - I don't think I learned much from them. Project 2, which used an openAI game was amazing and made the entire class worth it in my book. The TA's did a great job, but at least for summer session there was essentially no instructor involvement. I'm still somewhat glad I took it for the overview of some of the cooler topics, but if you really loved Machine Learning's practical focus, you might be disappointed with this class. For context, this was my second class after ML4T, so I had not taken ML.\n\nThe instruction format is Udacity lectures plus many many research papers to read. The lecturers (Isbell and Littman) are very engaging but the material itself can be quite dense. And the research papers are tough to get through if you are not used to reading academic CS papers. There are also weekly office hours with the TAs which were very helpful. The TAs were very accessible, hosting office hours and appearing in the Slack group.\n\nThe structure of the class is 2 homework assignments with a week to complete, then a project with 2 weeks to complete, for a total of 6 HW and 3 projects. There was an opportunity for an extra 10 points on one HW assignment. The assignments are released in 3 batches, so you can work ahead to some degree but couldn't finish the semester all at once.\n\nThe homework was challenging conceptually at times but usually did not require much code. I thought all of the homeworks did a good job of reinforcing concepts from the lectures. All 6 assignments were submitted through a web app that gave immediate feedback on your results. Each question on the assignments had a 10 submission limit to prevent brute-forcing solutions.\n\nTwo projects involved reproducing results from research papers, and one involved training an agent for an OpenAI Gym environment, using an algorithm from a research paper(s) of your choice. The deliverable was the code on Github and a 5-page report on your results. \n\nI did not enjoy the projects based on reproducing papers and didn't find the topics very interesting. The OpenAI project was quite interesting but very time-consuming. Training time for the agent could take many hours so iterating on a concept was difficult.\n\nOverall I thought the course was very well done even though I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was more theory and less practice than I would have liked, but that's a matter of personal preference. I found the workload to be pretty high in RL, not unexpected for this much graduate-level content in a summer session, but I did find it to be enjoyable. That said, I haven't taken the final yet, and I'm in the period that I dreaded all summer knowing that I didn't have enough time to watch many lectures or read papers outside of what was required for the homeworks and projects. Unfortunately, right now, I'm cramming facts for the exam (25 T/F with \"twitter style\" answer justifications). During the summer session you have something due every week, with 2 homeworks and 1 project released simultaneously every 3 weeks and I found myself not having much time to spend on anything else other than getting those done. I did the best I could to get the homework done as early as possible to maximize time spent on the projects. \n\nI disagree with criticisms of the TAs this summer. These guys were great, worked hard, and likely felt the pressure of the compressed schedule more than we did, especially since the profs were absent - the TAs completely ran the course (and did a pretty good job IMO). \n\nThe only ML background I had coming in was ML4T and I didn't feel that I needed any more than that as preparation. Its a good class, if you take it in the summer, know that it will be a lot of work. I spent a lot of late nights/early mornings and missed a couple of family events as a result of taking it, but have no regrets Great course overall. \n\nLectures: Not bad, but get seriously math intensive by the middle and they don't really tie back to the projects that well. I skipped the last few to prioritize other things. There are also ~30 readings you should cover, and the textbook that you'll definitely need to refer to. \n\nAssignments: There are a bunch of assignments plus 3 big projects. The assignments are generally very easy, and only sometimes require programming. The projects are huge time sinks. I really enjoyed the OpenAI Gym assignment as I used it as an opportunity to learn deep Q networks (not covered in the class) and thus had fun with the project. I still burned at least 60 hours on it though. The other projects involved implementing old RL papers, and I didn't enjoy these very much. \n\nExams: Just the final. Pretty hard to study for as there's a lot of material covered in the course. \n\nTeaching staff: Professors are completely AFK, but TAs do a pretty good job keeping the class on track. Office hours are fun though of questionable value beyond entertainment. You'll have to figure out most things on your own. \n\nGrading: Fair. I put in a lot of effort, learned more than I have in any class before, and came out with an A. I could have spent much less time and still gotten at least a B. Positive:\nGreat material\nGreat TAs\nGreat \"extra\" videos to help explain parts of the projects\nThe autograder site\n\nNegatives:\nWAY too much workload for summer. \n\n\nThis was by far the heaviest class I have taken so far. Starting from week 4 through the end of the semester I didn't have a single night off from either reading papers, watching lectures, doing the homework, or completing a project. \nThe class tried to cram the entire semester (16 weeks) into the shortened summer semester (12) weeks. We had our assignments released in sets of 3 with 2 homeworks and 1 project. The projects were longer and required a write up. The homeworks were typically turned in online and we would get instant feedback. That was awesome. The course is pretty challenging but doable with good amount of effort. Through the semester, I had to constantly work on projects/hws and on top of reading papers but it's definitely worth the effort and you realized how much you learned after finishing the course and there is a lot more. I personally felt project and hw had enough time but it was too short to prepare for final for summer. You will be very busy completing the project and had only 1 week to cover all the materials covered through the semester. The projects were the crown jewels of the course. They were most of all fun, exciting, lengthy, full of pitfalls, horrifying, and on top of that you do learn quite a lot about the subject matter (as well as a lot of other subject matters outside of the purview of the course). Paraphrasing another classmate in the course - \"I've only cried a handful of times in my adult life, Project 2 is one of those times.\"\n\nTAs were a great team and put together a lot of excellent supplemental discussions and materials for the course.\n\nStick with Python, Linux, and get a start on projects and homeworks the very moment that they are assigned. The homeworks and projects are interweaved with each other in some sensible way. If you print out all the required paper readings, you'll find they are almost 2\" thick. \n\nThe final exam required a very large breadth and depth of knowledge of everything presented in the semester.\n\nI've previously taken only ML4T before taking RL, and I thought it was sufficient. I really wanted to like this course. I really expected it to be educating and interesting. Instead what we got was a 3 month long race to complete the assignments on time. \n\nThe bad:\n- There's no academic staff in this course. It's completely outrageous that a graduate level in CS is run by TAs. Isbell and Littmann are NOT following this course at all. Office hours are held by TAs which have no clue how to answer deeper questions on the subject. \n\n- Assignments and course load are horrible. \"go reproduce this and that paper's graph\", \"and you should also read 4 papers this week\". \nVague instructions, no help, no guidance whatsoever. If you have a full time job, you'll struggle. Constant banging your head against the wall, no learning there. \n\n- Lectures ARE BAD. Yes, Isbell and Littmann are entertaining. But educating? No. The lectures are an incoherent, unordered mess. Anyone who watched David Silver's RL videos would agree with me - no contest. \n\n- TA staff is not helpful nor attentive, they are not on Slack and they usually don't answer questions on Piazza but wait for a student to answer. \n\nThe good:\nWell, the subject matter itself is interesting. \n\nBottom line:\nDon't take this course. No ifs. Just don't. The class concept is very cool. Don't kid yourself though, this is a tough course. Extremely fast-paced with heavy reading of 20-50 pages of technical journal articles or the instructor's PhD Thesis chapters every week. In addition, there is a project or homework due almost every week. Sometimes you get two weeks to complete something and in that case, you really need it. Many of the applications are reproducing journal articles' suggested methods and comparing results. Better know RLPY or the Java Burlap before you take the class or you'll start out behind. Best if you have had some form of linear programming before. This is not an easy course unless you work in the field. I do not. I ended up dropping it. Mostly echoing comments above: There's a lot of math here. I really enjoyed the RL section of 7641, especially the last project. This is a bit more theoretical than I would like; very useful for people who plan to go farther with RL, but I was hoping for more 'practical stuff' (including lots of algorithmic detail) and projects that are more oriented towards interesting RL scenarios and less about examining some edge case. (All that said, the profs are fantastic, and it's fun to learn from such leaders in the field. ) I agree with the above. I feel like the math is even more complicated than the maths in ML. I tried vey hard but I am not getting good grades for most of the assignments. Also unlike Intro to Computer Vision, you don't receive partial credits for assignments. If all your test cases give wrong answers, you will get 0 point for the assignment. Doesn't make a different if your overall program strcuture/though process is mostly correct.  I've gotten A's on everything so far, but it's been a lot of work and by no means easy... Same or greater difficulty than Machine Learning, but what do you expect, it's taught by two Reinforcement Learning specialist. The good is that the content is cool, and the TAs/professors are fairly active. I would only recommend taking this class if you took the Machine Learning class and thoroughly enjoyed the last few lectures on reinforcement learning. Edit: Just had the 8th homework assignment. Literally sat in a chair all weekend working on it for 20+ hours, to only get close to the right answer. Be wary of what you're getting yourself into. The homeworks aren't as monolithic as CS7641, but there are more of them and ultimately they definitely add up to more work.  A fascinating class. You get to dive deep into reinforcement learning and actually reproduce important research papers in that domain. In particular, one of the projects involves deep reinforcement learning! I actually went on to reproduce some of DeepMind's recent papers on deep learning for Atari games, something which I would never have guessed I could do before this class.\n\nThe video material is quite engaging, but I found that it left some things fairly vague (for instance, I don't think it presents Q-Learning in a very clear way, though you definitely get to understand it through the assignments). Still, it covers a lot of advanced RL which is very exciting. This course covered a lot of information, and I thought the lectures were excellent at inspiring curiosity and giving a high-level overview. The readings lined up very well with the lectures (it's wonderful to be able to read in more detail exactly what was presented at a high level), and it gave good exposure to research in this area. I thought the two projects were meaningful too - they left the implementation up to us, but required that we intimately understood the details of particular papers. \n\nHowever, I thought the assignments were sometimes a bit lacking in relevance and rigor, and the feedback and involvement left a bit to be desired. It's difficult to have such a breadth of abstract information presented without much concrete practice to back it up.  The material is great (very interesting and challenging) and the professors are excellent. Taking this in the summer can be a bit overwhelming; be prepared for a significant time commitment. I always managed to get the work done on time but I usually finish assignments early and noted many students struggled to keep up. \n\nThe good: I learned a lot and was challenged. Professor Littman made an appearance at the end, which was wonderful and appreciated. Project 2 was a big hit with the students. \n\nThe bad: The Professor wasn't (visibly to the students) involved in the class. It would have been good to have had some interactive sessions with him or even some piazza participation. \n\nThe mixed: The TAs ran weekly office hours. I felt those started off well and 2 of the TAs did some hands on sessions, which were great. However, they lacked consistency and did not engage in depth with the students about theoretical concepts, which would have been very useful. Questions were often ignored or not completely answered. It's great to have so many papers and resources to absorb but to have a discussion about it and how the student/TA interpreted the material would have facilitated learning even further. The interaction with fellow students in the class on slack helped fill in the gaps but it would have been good to have had the TAs (or the Professor) helping to drive discussion/learning a little more. I haven't taken machine learning course, but directly this RL course. I have taken HPC, HPCA and database course and the declared as computer system specialization. To be honest, for me the homework and projects are not very hard, the most time-consuming part and most unexpected part is the report part. No matter how many efforts you put on the report, the score seems just a random number from 80-90 for me. It pretty frustrated me sometimes as in most computer system courses, if you got the code right, you can almost get 100% score.  Overall, not a bad course, RL is very interesting although the lecture is elusive. The grade is generous. I got overall 84.5% but still an A.  There is a lot of math and a lot of homework, I would pair this one with an easy course if not sure what you are doing. I haven't taken ML, yet I'm doing pretty well on this class. One thing though, I work on it over 15h a week, every week. So it could be stressful if you are not use to having deadlines that you do not know how to solve, right on your head. Having a deadline every week, of homework that are even difficult to read and understand what is being asked is very challenging. I suggest you come prepared for some fun.  I found the workload to be pretty high in Reinforcement Learning and one of the reason could be the summer semester, but I did love this course and could not have asked anything better than this. I specially loved the Lunar Lander Open AI gym project, it was great to watch code to land the lander. \n\nHWs: I did find HWs easy but were quite tricky at the same time, and the submission & instant grades for the home works made it super awesome. \n\nProjects: As mentioned by TA's before hand, I did also find P1<P2<P3 in increasing difficulty level. Recreating the results of the research papers was quite difficult for me as missing any point in the paper or making wrong assumption made it really difficult to replicate the results. Apart from that I loved the projects and now, after this course, I got bit comfortable reading the research papers. \n\nTo be continued.... (see above comment - ran out of space) Weekly assignments were easily accomplished with a few lines of code in Python without having to think too much in terms of MDPs. The final project required many more hours of reading and coding than the first.  Good course overall !!! \nProjects are interesting... you get to know about latest research - hard work but you learn a ton.. Get grip over some algebra - it will only help.. \nOne pro tip - focus on the report you submit - even if you are not able to accomplish end goal - just put in arguments about the subject matter and what all you tried.. you will be rewarded for your efforts and reports and not about the actual result - makes total sense - but something I was not aware of.. The RL problem: How does an autonomous system learn from experience to achieve approximately optimal behavior without necessarily having any knowledge of its world dynamics or even what its goal is? You start with very small toy problems that can be solved directly using dynamic programming. From there, you gradually introduce the complications of the real world - infinite state spaces, stochastic reward functions, the inclusion of other agents that may be cooperative, adversarial, or indifferent, all the while learning of research from the past few decades resulting in tractable ways to induce human-or-better levels of performance in domains such as game play, autonomous drone flight, logistics scheduling, teaching robots to walk. \n\nThe idea is absurdly simple. Start with effectively random prediction of how well particular primitive actions might work and successively refine those predictions from whatever feedback you eventually receive, which may or may not be accurate feedback. Somehow this works, and this course gives you a mix of the mathematics to prove when and why it works, why it might work in practice even if you can't prove it works, and some of the practical research leading to hacks and tricks that make it work faster, better, or both. \n\nThe pros are the lectures and readings are engaging, insightful, among the best you'll get in this program. The projects, reproducing published research, give you the valuable real-world experience of just hacking away and making educated guesses until success magically happens. Then you have to figure out how it happened and be able to explain it. \n\nThe con is the weekly homeworks are too easy, simple algebra problems that might take a few lines of code but sometimes you can just do in your head, none of which take more than a couple minutes, basically free points. That time could be devoted to more projects. Function approximation (deep RL) especially is critical and hot and in the headlines and we barely covered it.  This was my first course in OMSCS (along with CSE6242) so I don't have much to compare it to.  The course was nicely structured, with coursework relatively spread out. 1 week HW due, 1 week HW due, 2 weeks for completion of a project. Homework assignments were relatively easy, projects should be started well in advance.  Reading external material helps a lot, and David Silver's lectures felt more detailed for the intro to the course. Recommendation: be intimate with Python; the later projects are much easier to complete in it. All around, the TAs were very helpful in office hours, and Slack becomes your best friend. I learned a ton, but definitely had to put the man hours in. Also, the final was rough... average was in the 50s. Overall, I really enjoyed the material, but completing the class (at least for the summer) was exhausting. The course requires a fast and consistent pace to keep up with the homework assignments and projects; I would not advise having any vacation or work responsibilities that take you away from the course for more than 2-3 days at a time. It definitely seems like this course has gotten quite a bit harder over time, as the workload indicated by the early reviews were quite lower than what I experienced. I would put this one and ML (7641) at roughly the same required time commitment, though RL is more focused on implementation and achieving a certain result, while ML is more focused on analysis and writing. \n\nPros:\n--Interesting material that really covers the seminal developments of the field\n--TAs do a strong job managing the class\n--The fastest grading I've experienced in the OMSCS program (tied with ML)\n--The autograder for the homework assignments was helpful. (You'll want to max out the points on homework to offset the inevitable point losses on the projects and final exam. )\n--The projects are interesting and challenging, with the second one being the best. \n\nCons:\n--No interaction at all with the professor\n--The style of the lectures isn't concise and sometimes sacrifices the content for entertainment. Tighter scripting would be helpful. (Many others, though, love the style. )\n--The oral presentations for the projects seem pointless. I never received any feedback on them, and they seemed to have no impact on my grades. \n--At least for the summer, there is a short window (less than a week) after finishing the last project to study for the final, which covers the whole semester. \n--Feedback isn't very detailed, and the specific point deductions for the projects and final exam are not revealed. \n--Just keeping up with the homework and projects can leave little time for reading the assigned papers I'm like the person below. I wanted to like this course a bit as the content really goes into cutting edge subjects (AI). Point of perspective, the whole Deep Mind / Alpha Go think is built on top of the content of (RL). In general though, there is no teaching and it's more like a sink or swim class, more like you are generally expected to know the content up front (90%) and the remaining should be easily learnable. I definitely did not come in with any RL knowledge at all. I made it, but the way the course is structured made it a lot more difficult than it should be. \n\nNegatives:\nToo many lecture readings per week. Who has the time to read 3-5 academic papers a week and absorb the content? I understand maybe 1-2, but to ask students to read 50-100 pages a week is a bit much. \nHomeworks not useful. \nNo coordination between HWS and Projects. HWs usually prep you for a project. This is not the case at all in this class. They are almost a unnecessary distraction. \nProjects were graded on how accurate can you reproduce a paper. I think this type of grading is poor, considering the people that wrote the paper, have usually have significantly higher qualifications then an OMSCS student and probably spent a couple months creating the results of the paper where OMSCS students have around two weeks to hack around and get the same results even though yes the equations are in the paper but they take a long time to understand and figure out. \nTA office hours not helpful. \nLectures need to be cut down. Who really has time to watch 3+ hours of lectures a week. Streamline to 1-2 hours. \n\nPositives:\nTA hands on sessions are useful. \nProject's content are really interesting. \n\nIn general, the course has potential. The problem is it's really meant for folks right know with a basic knowledge of RL versus none. HWs need to be revamped to intro to a project, example, a HW could be done on linear programming with probabilities as a trivial example as basically project 3 that's all it's about. This was my first OMSCS class. \nOverall, I think it's a good class. I learned a lot and certainly think I have a foundation for reinforcement learning now.  I had to do all sorts of outside research, but I think that is expected.  The T.A's did a great job, shoutout to all of them (especially Chris Serrano for his slack help during P2) they were very supportive and active on piazza and slack.\n\nI have a background in ML so that was helpful (especially for P2, where you need to basically use DL).  The videos are mostly good, but I highly recommend people to watch David Silver series.  It seriously helps for the first 4 HW's and 2 projects.  I would actually watch him first, then Charles and Michael.  They are very deep and abstract, while he is really concrete and practical.  I think it's better to have the \"normal\" stuff first before you get blasted into space and time.\n\nMy main issue was with the lectures actually, it's just very theoretical material and I could not always follow.  Watching at 1.3x speed is a good idea to get broad strokes, especially if you don't love proofs.\n\nThe final is pretty hard -  make sure to study for it.\n\nFinally, I did well on the projects, but I somehow unlocked what the T.A's did not spell out. Which is that you need to write your report about what the project means, not what you did. Which may not be obvious, because doing the actual work involved a lot of head-banging and late nights, so by the time you are done with the work you may forget to think about why you did it at all.\n\n\n If you liked ML, then I highly recommend this course. Isbell and Littman are a great team and produce excellent lectures. A good breadth of material is covered, and it leaves you with enough leads and a strong enough foundation to do your own exploration after the course is over. It left me wishing that there was a more advanced offering for RL in this program. \n\nThe work portion of this course consisted of eight assignments and two projects (for the summer semester; there are three in the normal offering, I think). The assignments were kind of hit-or-miss. There were a few that were excellent and engaging, and there were a few that were a bit too easy or disconnected from the material. Additionally, there were a few problems with the autograder site, either in terms of what it would accept or where there was a marked disconnect between what the assignment description on the site said versus what was actually expected. Just be sure to check the descriptions on Piazza and attempt submission early. \n\nThe projects were reproductions of academic papers accompanied by a short written report and a brief video. The projects were interesting, but not as open-ended or as tough as ML. Make sure that you have some ability to create a video (e. g. slides and voice-over) and don't leave it for the last day.  The class was interesting and delved into reinforcement learning much more than the Machine Learning class. The video lectures were engaging and explained concepts well. Reproducing results from papers was a new exercise for me and helped increase my understanding of the difficulties of doing that when the paper publisher doesn't provide enough detail. I was a bit disappointed that Prof. Isbell wasn't as active during the class as he had been in Machine Learning. This class I've been looking forward to taking, and I haven't been disappointed. Now when I read research papers on reinforcement learning I actually understand what I'm reading! The HW is often challenging, and fun too. I had been a bit worried about having to use Java for the class, as I'm a novice. Over the break I spent some time studying Java to prepare, but was pleasantly surprised that I've been able to do all the assignments using Python! :-) Now the course is Python-friendly, so Pythonistas are welcome. In short, another excellent OMSCS course, taught by reinforcement learning experts. I highly recommend it!! This was an interesting course where you get to learn about how machines/agents can learn about their environments and learn to interact with the environment using different learning techniques. The course was very challenging, but part of the challenge is tied into taking the course in the summer. With 6 homeworks, 3 projects and a final added on top of 20+ hours of lecture and 25+ papers to read, it's a lot of content for an 11 week (really, nothing much is available the first week, so 10-week) semester. \n\nThe TA group was top-notch - the best group of TA's I've encountered. \n\nThe projects were challenging, but fulfilling to get them done, similar to ML in that respect, but definitely a lot more hands-on. Also, you are expected to both write a short (3-page) paper and complete a short (5 minute) video presentation for each project. \n\nThe homeworks can be hit or miss. Of the 6, 3 were somewhat time consuming, and 1 of the 3 was extremely time consuming, however that may change in future semesters as they have been adjusting the HW to move towards a more auto-graded style. 5/6 were auto-graded and the one that was not was the extremely time consuming one. \n\nThe final exam is challenging, but fair, in it's current format. This is speculation, but given the expected 2 weeks to study in a normal semester, it would likely have felt a bit more manageable to review all of the content. \n\nOverall, I thought the course was worthwhile, but it is definitely not one to take lightly with regards to workload or effort required. \n\n3 programming projects worth 50%. You need to read 3 academic papers and try to reproduce the figures. No more guidance, paper hard to read.  Exam is 50% and very difficult to understand the requirement.  If you want to take it, you better prepare with a strong heart and large time commitment. There are some changes this semester.  The professor is not engaging and the TAs are very reluctant to give you any really useful guidance or hint. \n\nSome students claimed it is fulfilling to learn RL, I dont disagree. But most of us end up watching youtube/google articles to learn the material. Yes, RL is fun, but not fun by taking this course to learn it.\n\nIf you look at the grade trend shown on the right, you can see the pattern. The course is spoiled by the popularity of the attendance and news article about AI Exellent course. There are many lectures to get through, and they get quite mathematical at times. But the homework assignments and projects are mostly practical-oriented. All the assignments really helped me test and cement my understanding of the theory. The course readings are all papers on reinforcement learning, many by the lecturers themselves, and I found there were too many to all read thoroughly. After taking this course I feel comfortable reading RL papers, and think I could write an interesting paper on the subject myself when I have some time.", 
    "CS-7646": " ML4T is my first course of OMSCS. It is overall a great introductive course to machine learning and stocks. ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning). \n\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction. \n\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642. \n\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments. \n\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions. This class is easier up front (unless you'll struggle with Python), and a satisfying challenge toward the latter end. I love that everything builds on prior work. Be aware of that, and make sure you get your earlier projects completed correctly. Writing them in such a way that you can understand and modify pieces later is also useful. The lectures are informative and entertaining. The ML topics were much more approachable here than in the Machine Learning course, but my perception is also skewed since I've already taken it and learned the concepts. The workload was manageable. Anyway, I loved it! This is an awesome course if you want to learn about Trading concepts. One-third of the course focuses on teaching the analysis in Python using numpy and pandas. This is by far the easiest class I've taken in OMSCS. \n\nThe course is mostly about Pandas/Python, then about the stock market and at the end a bit of Machine Learning. \n\nI would suggest this as a good course to learn Python and get an intro to Machine Learning. But the ML part is a bit disappointing mainly because they take sooo long to get to it. The class would be better if they compressed the first two units and focused on the ML. \n\nGreat class to take with other classes. Not much background needed.  Fun projects; entertaining lectures. Project difficulty seems to depend a lot on your coding skills; auto-grader scripts are provided and take out a lot of the guesswork around requirements (if the grading scripts work, your code probably works well enough to pass). Exams are pretty straightforward and don't rely on memorizing minutiae Awesome course!!! Simply loved it.. \n\nI have already done ML and RL. Also, I have had interest in stocks and was familiar with many technical indicators - I have cleared CFA level 1 few years back. So take my feedback and number of hours with a grain of salt.\n\nThis class introduced a totally new perspective to Technical Trading. It was a breeze - its not too tough to get an A. \n\nAt the same time, there is no scope for error - you miss one assignment - you are done.. Just stay focused and calm - you will do good. I found this class to be extremely tedious. The documentation for the assignments was very lengthy but somehow always seemed to leave things out. For example, marketsim. py: there is no way you are getting that assignment working without the office hours (which has nearly line-by-line pseudocode). On the KNN assignment, the assignment page did not clearly specify the runtime requirement, so I ended up rewriting my solution. Etc and so on. The course work was way out of balance, with the first half (or so) of the course having almost no work and the last half being heavily loaded. Also, I felt like the list of hundreds of questions to \"study\" for the midterm was counterproductive, as these questions were student written and just generally hard to parse. A lot of my frustration came from Pandas (a python module) which has a really annoying and backwards API and doesn't adhere to the way things are generally done in Python. Overall I spent hours and hours googling ways to do stuff in Pandas, reading piazza, pouring over the assignment docs, etc, which just somehow doesn't feel really rewarding.  This was my first class in the program and I enjoyed it. I'd recommend it as a first class for anyone.\n\nMost assignments took me around 3-5 hours. There were two larger assignments with writing components which took me around 20 hours each. \n\nThe class was well run overall although the assignments were usually not finalized until a week (sometimes less) before they were due. This is not a course that can be \"front-loaded.\"\n\nA 90% is required to get an A, but since the assignments are mostly auto-graded and the assignments have clear grading requirements (like 10% for graphs, 20% for code, etc) 90% is very achievable. I liked the material for this course.  It was exciting at times.  Unfortunately, the course is poorly run.  We used reddit instead of Piazza for some reason and it seemed that no one's questions ever got answered - and if they did, they were way too late.  Assignments weren't \"finalized\" until quite late and even then, you couldn't submit them because the no one thought to add the assignment to t-square.  Exams were a joke: trick questions, rote memorization of terms/formulas, questions about python/pandas output - even questions about plot points of a vaguely-topical movie.  I'd still take this class, but I would prepare yourself for this sloppiness.  I would also skip on buying the required textbooks: not useful for the course itself, IMO. I came into this class with little or no background in Python, Machine Learning, or finance. There was certainly a learning curve in all three areas but the course did a good job of introducing the material so that even a newbie like me could catch on. The lectures on Udacity are well done. The assignments are solid and teach you a lot (be careful, often they build on each other so you can't just skip one and think you'll be fine). \n\nI had two issues with the course - 1) assignments weren't finalized until a week (sometimes less) before the due date. The professor would say \"you can use the old version to get started, not much will change\" but both times I did that I had a few hours of rework once the final version was released. I am not sure why a course that's as mature as ML4T can't get assignments finalized sooner, my three previous classes released everything well before the due dates. 2) Reddit was not a good forum for the course. My guess is that anonymity was a factor, some students were downright rude to one another. Other students asked really simple questions that were answered clearly in the assignment or syllabus. I wonder if having your real name tied to the post would have reduced some of that. Also, the threads got too long. I had two questions that never got answered (slack was helpful when that happened). Other times replies would go on the wrong thread and it was confusing to read. I have nothing against reddit, but it didn't seem a good fit for this course. \n\nAs for workload, some weeks I put in only a few hours, other weeks were more like 20 hours when a project was due. I was learning Python while doing the projects, so that may be higher than normal. Agreed with other comments that the midterm was tough to finish (I finished with maybe a minute left, and I'm normally a great test-taker). I finished the final with plenty of time, but several questions were ridiculously unconnected to course content. \n\nFinally, the tone of the class was a bit off to me. Some of the professor's responses on reddit were rude. I've taken other classes in the program where I felt like the TAs and professor really cared about the students and their learning. In this class I didn't get that vibe at all.  Very fun course. I recommend you take this prior to Machine Learning as I think it serves as a good introductory course. I could have done without the finance portions of this course. It's pretty simple, but if you are into trading, you will enjoy this course more than me. I had not done much Python before taking this course, but I have done a lot of Ruby and coding in many different languages. I will say that someone with more Python, numpy, and pandas experience will find this course easier than I did. It was not hard, but there was a lot of learning involved for me since I hadn't used the libraries before. Great introductory course to Python and Machine Learning. Projects vary in difficulty but be prepared to start early for some of them. The projects took me between 3 to 15 hours each, depending on the length and difficulty. TAs and professor respond quickly on Reddit, and the other students are very helpful in providing suggestions and ideas. Each project was pretty easy, but we had about 8 so that was tough to keep up with (and most project descriptions weren't finalized until a week before they were due). I really enjoyed learning about finance and trading, but wished the class involved more machine learning. The professor was very active on Piazza. The course material was fascinating and broken down nicely. Professor Balch and his team of TA's were the most impressive in terms of responsiveness and clarity I have seen out of this program. Posting to piazza did not feel like throwing your seed on the rocks as it sometimes did for other classes; there was always a swift response either from the instructors or classmates. My one complaint was that the order of assignments left all of the hard work for the end. Professor Balch actually indicated that he was going to take our feedback under consideration and adjust that, which is yet another aspect that indicates that he really cares and wants the class to be a success.  Fun lectures, great assignments and crazy exams. The class forum on reddit was challenging to keep up with after having been used to Piazza.\nProgramming experience would definitely help since most of the assignments are python heavy especially vectorization for performance.\nOverall I never expected to learn so much about the Trading domain and now I feel fairly confident managing my own portfolio; which I think was a big plus for me on the financial front.\nThis course left me with an yearning for exploring the trading space - thanks to Tucker Balch - A great teacher indeed!!! As other students have stated, this course was easier in the past, but has progressively become harder and with very little room for any mishaps. There is no curve, and the mid-term and final exams are like sprints, you barely have time to complete them, and a lot of students actually weren't able to complete the mid-term. The extra credit assignment is a joke, it requires more effort to complete than multiple projects combined, and it only contributes to 2% of your total grade. These horrible features of this course make it extremely nerve-racking, because you can easily lose a letter grade in the blink of an eye. It almost seems at times as if the professor dislikes seeing students do good in this course, and he tries really hard to prevent you from earning an A; I was able to earn one in the end, but it wasn't an \"easy A\" at all. I personally avoided asking questions via Reddit, because of the snarky replies the professor would issue to students. The course serves as a good introduction to Machine Learning, and you get to apply Machine Learning to stock trading in the last project, which was awesome.  Something else which you need to consider is the fact that projects build on each other, therefore if you fail to complete a project, or you implement it incorrectly, you will be toast. A fantastic first course. I've previously written a review midway through the semester, but wanted to update it. \n\nThe first two of the three mini-courses in this class are very easy. The projects in the final machine learning mini-course get a little more tricky. I was basically watching four or five lectures the day before the assignment was due, not having any problems, coding the project, and getting solid marks. Do NOT try to do that in the ML portion of the course. \n\nThe ML concepts are not difficult, but the projects can take a little work to get right. I probably spent ~16 to ~24 hours on each of the final three projects. Consider me your own personal Jacob Marley, coming back from beyond the semester warning you to do as you should, and not what I did. Respect the final mini-course, and you'll be fine.  The focus on this class seems to be more towards the trading side of things. If you want a deep dive into ML topics, this isn't such a class. There is use of ML techniques like Reinforcement Learning, but know that the main subject is trading in on itself. Fall 2017 was the first time Reddit was used instead of Piazza and I felt like this experiment didn't work out that well. For an academic class, Reddit just doesn't have enough tools to deal with all the announcements and tags needed. Professor Balch was great and very hands on though! He was quick to reply in all posts and questions and so were the TAs. The lecture structure has changed a little (no longer follows the order on Udacity) but otherwise they were straight to the point. The add on lectures on Youtube helped supplement the material and projects well. The projects don't take too much time to complete and sometimes all it takes is an \"ah hah!\" moment to figure out what you need to do. Great class to pick up as a first class. I liked the course overall but definitely think it has more potential than what's actually being done. I rated it medium because really most of the projects took me around 6 hours to complete. Which I really don't think is bad. There were really only two projects that took around 8-10 hours to complete so in the end I rated it medium because most of the projects were. On average with assignments and lectures (plus the occasional reading), I would say it took me around 12 hours a week. That's on the high side again given that homework is due usually every other week. That being said here's the review. The course is really split into two sections. The front half is a lot of stock and market information with hands on Python assignments to supplement the learning. The latter half of the course is more machine learning in conjunction with Python and stock and finances. You don't need to be an experience python user to take this course. Though I did have experience using the Python libraries and Python is a language I program in every day so it will certainly help. Also, you don't have to be a stock expert. The lectures are straightforward an well laid out in nice manageable chunks. In fact most were 1 hour lectures I could easily do during my lunch if I wanted. The profession is very knowledgeable, funny, and a good presenter; you'll enjoy watching the lectures. This class really glances over a few machine learning algorithms and you'll program a few but I wouldn't say it's a full deep dive into Machine Learning. In fact it's really about using algorithms to trade stocks and manage portfolios. This of course makes it solid intro class. There were of course some drawbacks. Communications throughout the semester was terrible. Reddit was used instead of Piazza for this semester which I think threw a lot of non-reddit users through a loop. I happen to use it often but it made the threads really noisy and messy with people asking numerous redundant questions and not putting comments in the right threads. Additionally, communication from the professor was far and few between. Assignment \"updates\" or comments about questions in the reddit threads (which could easily grow in the few thousands) were fair game for requirements on assignments (even if not listed on the rubric). Assignments were hardly finalized until a 3-5 days before their due date and portals to submit were often times opened days before they were actually due. My TA was impossible to get ahold of throughout the semester. The assignments tended to have subtle but time consuming changes that needed to happen each week (one week give the output in this dataframe and the next is needs to be a series or another datatype). This wouldn't be bad overall if two things happened. 1. There was a blip or sample of what the output should look like. 2. Each week you weren't forced to retool your other classes and functions to accommodate the returns to be some new data type for the input of a new function. Overall, the factors above speak for themselves. I found the course engaging and entertaining enough to give it a Liked, I didn't spend forever on it each week, and it was fairly average difficulty wise. One of the great classes I have taken. While it provided a nice intro to ML, the projects were challenging and interesting, with lots of scope for experimentation that kept me hooked. One of the coolest professor and head TA I have seen in the last 4 semesters. Workload will vary. But if you are inquisitive about trading, then this course is definitely recommended.  I don't understand how anybody likes this class. The lectures are very weak and the class has been poorly run. In terms of my experience, I would rate it just slightly better than Computer Networks, which is widely understood to be the worst class in the program. The saddest thing about this course is the difference between my excitement going into this semester and my disappointment during it. I was looking forward to this class so much, and it's been a tremendous let down.  Professor Balch & TA's, \n \nThank you so much for doing an amazing job running this course. The response time for this course was amazing. I don't know how you all managed that, but this shows the dedication with which you all work and value your job. Congratulations!\n \nAny feedback without mentioning the lecture videos would, to me, be unfair. For ML videos to be not boring is a monumental task, but I, and I think remaining class shares this sentiment, rather enjoyed them and would listen to them in extended sessions. So, Congatulations on that too!\n \nThe assignments about 80/85% of the time are well managed and well explained, with a clear rubric set for students to meet. In comparison to other better-managed classes, I'd rate this aspect of the class up there with the best. \n \nOn the improvement side, I'd personally like to see following:\nMid-term question creation should be replaced with better directed assignments/projects. I didn't see any value in them. Sorry :(\nSome might not agree with me, but I think first mini-course should be left for students to explore. I'd rather start with Mini Course 2 and ML part immediately afterwards\nRight now, the course gives a touch of ML for Trading systems. I think this leaves room for more \"in-class\" experimentation. Perhaps more algorithms, ideas etc... I'd rank this course from easy-to-medium difficulty; but, I think it should be, with some more directed effort towards ML and its experimentation with Trading systems, medium-to-high difficulty range. \nLecture videos are so good that I would love to see more of them. Other ML algorithms, their analysis etc... Perhaps students don't have to be assigned tasks from them if it becomes too much, but still they can always see them and learn from them in their free time. \n \nI have had great fun with this course, and I hope everyone else has too.  This was a really great class. It was a good introduction to machine learning and finance. Up front, there is also quite a bit of material to get you up to speed on Python, Pandas, and numpy. The summer definitely felt pretty rushed, and they had to sort of combine the last two projects together. This was probably one of the easier courses in the program, but worth the time and effort. The professor was really engaged, and we had some really good TAs as well. Overall the course content is great, but how the course is run leaves something to be desired. Be aware when the schedule is released that it may look like you have 2+ weeks for some assignments, but the professor will take so long in updating and finalizing the assignment that realistically you will have 1 week or less to finish it. And of course they won't let you know when to expect the assignment to be finalized either. \n\nThe projects can be quite interesting, and so far they're decently (but not overly) challenging. Previous reviews mention the course \"ramping up\" the difficulty over the semester, but they've redone the schedule of projects so be aware that some of the more challenging projects (assess learners I'm looking at you) are now earlier in the semester. \n\nI would definitely still recommend this class as the interesting projects/materials make up for the communication/expectation issues and the professors snarky responses on reddit. Pros:\n-Well organized class with worthwhile papers and lectures\n-Dr. Balch and TAs are quite active on Piazza. Reasonable questions are answered with sufficient details\n-Great first course for the program\n-Great intro to machine learning (decision trees, classification, regression, reinforcement learning)\n-Applicable! I went right into investing after finishing the course and made some decent returns :-)\n\nCons:\n-Starts off with hand holding and as soon as deadline to drop comes, workload significantly increases. I remember procrastinating on MC3P3 and ended up spending 20-30 hours on it. \n-Depending on your interest, projects in the end can become time sinks. I really tried to get significant returns compared to the benchmarks! This was my first class in the OMSCS program and I am very glad that I was able to take it. I have never been interested in anything remotely related to finance, so I was slightly concerned about whether or not I would enjoy this course. Professor Balch does a great job explaining the finance content without assuming any prior knowledge about trading. I've actually had conversations with coworkers about day trading thanks to what I learned in this course. It is practical!\n\nI found the projects to be enjoyable throughout the semester. They do a good job of building upon each other as the semester progresses, and they're balanced appropriately. The two most difficult (time consuming) projects were spread throughout the semester. The midterm was fair and shouldn't be too challenging to anyone that stays on top of the course content throughout the semester. \n\n**Major pro**: all assignments for the semester were released in draft at the start of the course. This allowed you to work ahead if you knew you had scheduling challenges coming up during the semester. \n\n**Biggest con**: Although the projects built upon one another, we often had to copy and paste code from one file into another. I would have liked the different files/classes to interact with one another a little better. That being said, though, that's a pretty minor con. \n\nThe coursework was never insanely difficult, but it did a great job providing an intro to some ML and RL concepts. I'd gladly take this course again and certainly recommend it! This was my sixth course in the program. I came at this course after ML and RL, and have had previous experience in the securities industry, so I found this course pretty easy, but not without its challenges. \n\nThe good: The material is really interesting, and Prof. Balch is incredibly enthusiastic about the topic. You get an opportunity to implement some ML algorithms from scratch, and you learn a lot about the markets. Personally, this course is where I learned how powerful and useful Pandas and NumPy are. \n\nThe bad: Really, only one thing -- the assignments are subject to change as late as a week before they are due. Usually the changes only require a few minutes of work to implement, but it is frustrating if you are the type of student who likes to move things from to-do to done as soon as possible. \n\nI believe this course would make a good first course in the program. It's a gentler introduction to machine learning than 7641, and teaches some skills that will prove useful throughout the program. The finance knowledge is also fascinating. Good intro course to ML. Also I learned a lot on stock market. Thanks to the lectures and TAs! It's a solid class with good projects. It's really three classes rolled into one:\n\n1. Working with data using Python, Numpy, and Pandas.\n2. Machine Learning\n3. Financial Markets\n\nI feel I learned quite a lot. I think it's a good class for beginners wanting to learn tools needed for other classes, such as Python/Numpy/Pandas and get introduced to machine learning. \n\nThe TAs were very good and active on Piazza. On the other hand, the professor seemed to sometimes forget about the class for stretches of time, without giving the TAs the tools / permissions to manage it. Great courses for anyone who is interested in both ML and Trading in stock market. The course was divided to 3 parts (intro to pandas, intro to financial market, ML for trading). This structure was excellent and really well-thought. Anyone with zero experience can get through this course smoothly (well you need common sense as well).\n\nLectures are okay and well prepared. There are some recorded on-campus lectures that explained the assignment in details. The assignment was easy since you can test your code in the remote machine so if you ace it, it means full score. Exam and mid-term were okay, you can review 1-2 days before taking it. The reddit experiment was not working and I hope they stick to piazza in the future. \n I really enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it.  It presents some machine learning concepts, like decision trees, gradient descent, and reinforcement learning, in a context with direct application.  The ML methods were not discussed in too much detail but enough to give the students an understanding of how they worked. \n\nIf you wanted to prepare for this course ahead of time brush up on pandas, numpy, and pyplot.  You'll spin your wheels a while if you've never used these libraries.  Some assignments can't be completed without leveraging the numpy and pandas matrix operations effectively (for loops cause the grader to time out) and there are some assignments that require reports with charts and graphs built with pyplot.  All the financial and market information you need for the course is presented at the beginning and I never wished I had studied that before hand.\n\nI should mention that the course starts off a bit disorganized but that improves.  Expect the first week or so to be on your own.  Also, the assignment instruction are often in a \"draft\" state until less than a week before they're due but none of them had significant changes when they were finalized.  Definitely, start them as early as you can.  You might be able to wrap them up ahead of time and have some stress free weeks. A really great class on its own, but Professor Balch's constant presence in Piazza makes it a game changer. He and the TAs are insanely responsive and always have a nice mix of hints & wit in their replies. \n\nThe assignments start off pretty simple and ramp up near the end. The third section can be challenging but very satisfying to see things working. The lectures are really wonderful, and the textbooks are also fantastic, which is something I rarely say. \n\nMy sole complaint is a big one: the mid-term. Essentially the class compiles a list of questions for the mid-term, which culminates into a 700-question bucket. Those who did well largely memorized as much of this as possible. It seemed like a large amount of busy work and taking exams based on memorization is a pretty crummy way to spend a Sunday. \n\nSo prepare for a really great, fun course with one bummer in the middle. All in all, highly recommended.  Solid course. \n\nPros:\n-Great as one of the earlier courses as it clearly explains the tools you'll mostly be relying on (using numpy/pandas etc). \n-Fun intro to ML/finance topics for those with 0 experience in either. \n-Active Professor\n\nCons:\n-Definitely an intro course as it doesn't go very deep into the subject matter. \n-I wish it went deeper into using RL concepts to trade, discussing more best practices and the 'real-life' hard learned lessons that I'm sure the Prof. has picked up, as well as using derivatives (they're only briefly mentioned). \n-I also wish that project/assignment specifications were finalized sooner. This was very annoying a few times. \n-The timed exams are silly. They're reasonably weighted, but don't have much value in terms of learning anything. \n-The Piazza participation requirement led to a ton of spam (\"+1\"s, memes, etc)\n\nBeing proficient in Python is a big plus. People also struggled with selecting technical indicators. Just don't over-complicate things. Finally, be aware that the class ramps up in terms of time commitment at the end, particularly for one project. My average time commitment was reasonable, but during one project I burned at least ~30 hours in a week. I really enjoyed this class. This was my 7th class in the OMSCS program and this one was one of the most practical classes I've taken. My undergrad included an AI specialization so I already had a decent understanding and moderate experience with machine learning. This class provided a good introduction to machine learning while still making the projects challenging enough for someone in my position to appreciate. \n\nMy biggest complaint with this class has to do with the fact that I took it over the summer. I would highly recommend that you take this class during a full-length semester if possible. I wanted to spend more time appreciating the concepts I was learning/implementing... but because of the fast pace of the summer, was unable to do so. I also didn't really appreciate that the instructors decided to add an extra exam this semester for the first time. It made the summer even more stressful than it already was. \n\nThe class is divided into 3 parts: 1) ML, 2) the stock market, 3) combining ML and the stock market. There are several projects (all coding, some include reports), two exams (finally is not cumulative), lots of lectures (with quizzes), and a participation grade that usually came in the form of a survey sent to your email. \n\nYou'll need extensive knowledge of Python for this class. This was my first OMSCS course and it was a great class to get me back into the groove of taking classes.  Professor and TAs were very active on reddit and the slack channel was great so it felt much more interactive than I have had with other online courses.  Videos/Lectures were great as they were on point with the assignments.  As many said, this is by no means an easy class, the projects build upon each other and be sure to start on the two week project assignments early as you are given 2 weeks to complete it for a reason. Unlike some others who have stated this class was super easy, I will contrast and state I thought it was very challenging. I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling. \n\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week. \n\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam. \n\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well.  ### Loved the course\nThis was my third course (after CP and SDP) and I have to say this was the most engaging class i have been in. There are 8 assignments that u can even start working on from the first day (of course not recommended). The videos are excellent - short, to the point and very close to the subject matter and the assignment. \n\n#### Assignments\nAll the assignments are evenly spaced and equivalently weighted. I would recommend referring to all the information \n at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Main_Page to learn more about this course itself.\n\nFew over achievers might grumble :), but the first part of the course (mini course for pandas) was extremely important for the final part of the assignments\n\n#### Exams\nThe exams are intended to test if your understood the videos and the concepts and does not try to trick you out of your grades. For the midterm, there are crowd sourced question banks whose intentions are to make sure you actually understood the various parts of the course. If you have gone through them all and figured out the basics behind them, the midterm should be simple enough though it is closed book and proctored.\n\nThe final does not have a question bank, but the same methodology of going through your videos and material should make it simple enough.\n\n#### Parting words\nThe last three assignments as noted as indeed challenging and equivalently given two weeks to complete. You can even start them on the first day though there might be tiny edits to the grading script at a later point.\n\nBut this is one of the best constructed courses and if you have some background in python, should be simple to pick up and any insights in finance would be an added booster.\n\n_Note: Though the course is constructed exceptionally well, it is not an easy A and you would still need to put in the hours required. Especially the two assignments marked as \"Very challenging\" easily took 20-25 hours over two weeks. _ I took this class thinking it would be easy but Professor Balch is really trying to end the stigma of this course being the easiest in the program. Wasn't as easy as the reviews said! He wants to make this a serious class for future semesters. Beware. You'll have a better time in this class if you took ML beforehand, so you can start off with a better understanding of the ML mechanics and focus on the financial aspects of the course. The projects were very fun, engaging, and was very applicable to the industry. Even though I got an A, I would hesitate to call myself a competent Quant. Interesting class.  Material is not terribly difficult if you keep up with the class schedule.  Assignments were good challenges, and I appreciated how they built upon themselves -- of course, if you get behind early on it's a challenge in later projects.   Udacity Video lectures are effective and entertaining, the YouTube videos have important material but are generally too long and not as well structured.    Professor B has a sense of humor that you will either love or hate -- if you want to prepare for this course skip the books and binge-watch some Monty Python. This has been a very interesting course... mainly because I've had some business background and have had an interest in computational finance. The projects have definitely been beneficial, but the organization/timeliness of the course team and how/when these projects were presented and what they actually covered was a bit disappointing. Yes, it was the first semester this was offered, so I expected it to be imperfect and feel the students have had grace for that. Going into the semester, I was thinking that between the two brand new courses I was taking, this would be the more organized b/c the instructor had taught this multiple semesters, already had a class website, and had an environment already setup. Another of the disappointments I have had are that many of the final projects have been filled with coding the underlying ML algorithms from scratch rather than actually applying ML to the quantitative finance domain. It seemed that ML knowledge was prerequisite for the course, so I therefore thought that's what the course was about. I'd expect some of this implementation of the basic workhorse algorithms in ML to be in an ML class... kind of like our implementation requirements of 7641. With that mindset, it seemed rather frustrating to receive project assignments approx. 1 week prior to the due date that were requiring this type of development... and again, not necessarily tied-to the trading / computational finance domain. I wish we could have spent the time working on some of the things that the extra credit proposed instead of working on developing my own KNN learner, bag (bootstrap aggregator) learner, Qlearner, or Dyna. \n\n... All that said, it really was a great class and I learned a lot. I actually began really liking Python through this course... it's mandatory, so be ready. Those taking the class do come away with a decent set of software that could be further developed to make a nice personal trading system.... or, if motivated enough, I suppose you could even start your own hedge fund.  First time this course was offered, very bumpy, but the professor is incredibly responsive and able to keep things moving. \n\nVery interesting course work, lectures are excellent and a great pace, assignments help you learn a lot and give you lots of tools for you toolbox.  This class assumes zero background in finance, numpy, pandas, and ML. It's a very gentle intro to all of these topics. The first 2 weeks walks you through some useful features of python, numpy, and pandas. The pacing is excellent and not \"drinking from a firehose\". After taking one of those famed \"Baptism of Fire\" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence. \n\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better. \n\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it's really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week. \n\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful. \n\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule \"squeezes\" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments. Every assignment has a grading rubric that serves as the specs for the assignment. Read those 3 times, then 3 times again before turning in the finished assignment. This was one of my favorite classes so far in OMSCS. Dr. Balch's lectures are perfectly \"bite sized\" and he explains difficult concepts clearly and concisely. The professor and TAs are all extremely active on Piazza as well. The work load is not that bad but it does ramp up toward the end of the class. I would highly recommend this class to others! The funnest course I have had so far. Starts kinda slow but the last 2 weeks were a total time sink. This class was quite the predicament. \n\nI came into it with minimal knowledge of python (literally what I picked up from CN) and minimal knowledge of machine learning. I had a basic to medium understanding of finance topics. I ended with an A in this class. \n\nThe problem? Professor Balch is kind of an egotistical dick; it comes out in almost every one of his piazza posts. The midterm was 30 minutes long with 30 questions and about a third of the questions were detailed \"what happens in this pandas/numpy code?\" without access to internet or the python interpreter. \n\nThe other problem? The final project is worth 17% of the grade but you're only given two weeks to work on it (maybe fall/spring will be longer) and the final exam is plopped right in the middle. \n\nSupposedly the final project was split into two projects previously and they had MUCH more time combined to work on it. I still managed 100/100 on it, but it added a few points to my blood pressure. \n\nOverall? I'd still take the class. Just be cautious and heed the rubrics. You can get an A even if you stumble on the exams. Very fun class. The professor(Balch) and all of the TAs were a ton of help in Piazza. The lectures were pretty good and the assignments were very engaging. \n\nI really wish there was more time carved out for the final third of the class as the difficulty and time spent really ramped up. The first two thirds of the class is prepping you with python lessons and some economic theory. Its not until the last third do you really start getting into the interesting machine learning stuff(which is really fun). \n\nOverall, WAY less time spent in this class than ML or RLDM. I learned a TON and it was engaging :D The workload in this class was on the lighter side but they are continuing to tweak the schedule so your mileage may vary. A portion of the course is devoted to learning Pandas, a Python library for working with financial data. No other class I've taken has done this. Usually you have to just learn the libraries on your own or as part of project work. I lot of time on projects is spent endlessly tweaking parameters and re-running your models, which is not terribly interesting. It is rewarding, however, when you come up with a profitable model. Prof Balch was very involved. Took this course to complete the ML specialization requirements. After having taken DVA, RL and ML, it was a shock to see how easy this course is. If you know little about ML and/or python, this is probably a good first class to take in the program, but if you do you are likely to be bored by the programming aspects.\n\nThe finance part was OK. I started out as a believer in the efficient market hypothesis (which basically says that you can't profit by doing ML for trading, and therefore that the material in this class should be essentially useless), and I like having been exposed to the perspective of a professor who obviously disagrees with it. I'm still not 100% convinced, but this was an interesting experience.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me was that the midterm was almost exactly the same as one of the sample midterms that was made available to us for reviewing. In other words, we were given the answers to the midterm beforehand... As someone who wants to be challenged, I find this very disappointing. Very well designed course. I actually took it just for the Python data science aspects and learned a great deal. One thing to watch out for is the assignments and submission windows are often open very late so try to plan accordingly. Good class with a very sneaky workload. \n\nThis class covers pandas/numpy, finance, and ML algorithms. It does a nice job of tying everything together progressively. If you have taken ML in this program, you will find the ML section comparatively very light and you should pretty much know everything, but I do feel I gained something from having to implement some of the algorithms myself. \n\nIf you had asked me half-way through the semester, I would have said this is probably the easiest class I have ever taken. But, the last third of the class covers the ML topics and the workload ramps up a bit, although it still was not too heavy. Just don't completely sleep on it. I would love to have seen a larger focus on the ML section and I believe Professor Balch has indicated he may do so in the future. This is a good class to consider pairing up with a harder class. \n\nFinally, Professor Balch was awesome. He was amazingly active on the forums, held many office hour sessions, and overall just seemed genuinely interested in giving us the best learning experience possible.  I was really looking forward to this course, but came away with a neutral view on it. The advantages are that the subject matter is pretty interesting, and you get to practice python in a pretty easy environment. \n\nHowever, like all OMSCS courses there is little to no feedback on your work. I'd love to see how to properly code some of the solutions to the projects, but I'll never see how to do it because the course organizers are too concerned with plagiarism in future classes. So I'm left at the end of the semester with an 'A' grade and a whole bunch of shitty code that works only half the time. I took off a few extra stars for the disorganization of the projects. Again, this seems to be the hallmark of a Georgia Tech course, where requirements constantly change right up to the deadline. Even when the requirements are finalized, we often couldn't submit until just before the deadline. \n\nPerhaps worst of all was the culture of Piazza during the term. Maybe we were just unlucky to have a high proportion of meanies in the class, but towards the end of term the forum mostly became a place to belittle other students, which culminated in a big, ugly, piazza fight. This kind of behavior was not discouraged by the TAs or the professor. Basic course for ML itself but a good introduction to Python/Numpy if you have no experience with them as it is barely any work except for 2 of the projects.  I had zero experience with both Pandas and Numpy and still only spent 5-7 hours every week. I also enjoyed the finance theory aspect. It made me appreciate the finance side of things more than I thought I would have.\n\nThe course itself will teach you not a lot new if you know even a bit about ML. The Q Learning RL project is interesting but is dealt with at a basic high level. I wish we spent more time on reinforcement learning.\n\nThe trading part is basic for an ML course focused entirely on trading. Yes we build some technical indicators to trade on but don't expect to learn anything cutting edge for finance. No Deep Learning. No discussion on high speed algo trading strategies. I wish we were trading in a simulator in real time for our final project or at least had a Kaggle final project. That would have been cool.\n\nThis is a good course if you're looking to get your feet wet in ML/Python but if you already took AI, RL and ML then it can be redundant. I recommend taking this course early on in your OMSCS career before you venture out to the other ML classes as it will be good prep for some of the harder courses. This course is a really enjoyable and practical. You will definitely learn a lot if you take it, both in terms of how to think about financial data, some financial concepts, how to work with Python libraries (especially NumPy and Pandas), and some machine learning topics. \n\nI think this course would be a great course to take before Machine Learning, because it introduces you to the topic of machine learning in a more gentle manner than the Machine Learning course. I paired this course with Computability, Complexity, and Algorithms, and that worked out okay. \n\nEven though this course was not extremely hard, I actually feel like it is one of the better and more beneficial courses in the program. It is both highly practical and very enjoyable. And I think that is true even if you never write another piece of code having to do with trading after the class is over. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind. While the workload is lower during the beginning of the semester, the projects towards the end of the semester are significantly more time-consuming. So keep that in mind when considering your schedule.  Not a bad class. The first two assignments were a breeze; just a copy n paste from the notes and text. The third assignment onwards got pretty hard.\n<br/>PROS: \n1. Excellent test cases. Even the py.test files were given so you could see the expected answers for the test cases. Prof encouraged students to share test cases as well.\n2. Professor was very active on reddit. Seems like 50% of all posts were from the prof.\n3. Assignment expectations and deliverables were clear.\n4. Course was well planned and executed. \n<br/><ol>CONS:\n1. Professor's posts were a little rough around the edges. If you have thick skin, then it won't be an issue.\n2. Prof's bully behavior encouraged bad behavior from students as well. Some simple questions asked by students got responses like \"you don't belong here at GT\", etc.\n3. Seems like prof was paranoid about class material leaking to future students. No suggested homework solutions were given. TA's were there to help clarify assignment details, but did not offer real help on homework. There were mistakes in notes, but were corrected in the video lectures (I think this was done to make notes useless to unauthorized people who get hold of the notes; just speculating). Going into this class, I had taken AI and knew a fair amount about stock trading.  This class gave an introduction to Machine Learning topics as well as stocking market concepts and in a final project, allowed you to create a market trading strategy that was powered by one of several algorithms you learned in class.  The course used Python and was light in a coding from my perspective as a software developer.  If you were not a coder, getting up to speed with Python and Numpy will take a fair amount of time.  Thankfully, as is becoming a trend in OMSCS courses, most of the assignments have grading scripts so you know the majority of your grade by the time you submit your assignment.  There is the caveat that reports require manual effort to be graded and occasionally, there are additional test cases the TAs use that are not included with the grading scripts but still fit within the specifications of the project.\n\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable class that was fairly graded.  There were two exams that were worth 12.5% of your grade each that were 30 questions in 30 minutes.  As you'd expect with that format, you must be a quick reader and thinker but ultimately know the concepts very well to do well on the exam.  For those that overanalyze or how to think through each exam questions, you will struggle on this kind of an exam and while the exams are not worth a large portion of your grade, you do need to perform decently to get an A in the class.\n\nAs with most classes you enjoy, the Professor makes the class what it is as the instructor lectures on Udacity are extremely engaging and entertaining while also being brief and informative.   Great course. I was expecting to apply my learning into the stock market but it may not be directly applicable. Course content is good, so is the pedagogy. The course's learning curve is a little steep towards the end. Make sure you start the final project implementation early.  This is definitely not an easy class (my overall grade for the class was >95%), especially for a person like me, who don't know much about either ML or trading. The exams were straightforward. The projects were of high quality and enforced students' learning: a basic market simulator, a random-tree learner (and how to beat this type of learners), Q-Learning robot maze navigation, and a learning trading agent. That last project (a learning trading agent) brought together virtually everything we learnt in that class into a single project! It was super fun, but was hard and time consuming. \n\nIn terms of time commitments, there were many quiet periods where nothing was due. But, I spent most of that time time reading suggested materials as much as I could. For instance, I read Prof. Balch book from cover to cover, skimmed Tom Mitchell's \"Machine Learning\" book, etc. And so, you may end up with less than 15 hrs/week on this class. \n\nOverall, I came out with a well-rounded understanding of what's going on in both ML and trading. Kudos to Prof. Balch for this solid class and his amazing organization. He was very funny and had a dry sense of humor. I would imagine taking his class in person might have been a very fun experience. Also, according to my fiancee, he had cute chuckles, which made her laugh. Fairly easy class that teaches the very basics of finance and machine learning. \n\nProbably a good fit if you're interested in learning about finance or have no exposure to machine learning and are interested in a softer introduction. If you've already taken CS7641 Machine Learning and have taken a finance class in undergrad this class may not provide you with much new information. For me, it was a nice refresher on both topics. Having taken ML, this course was a breeze (and even without, I'd recommend it as a good companion class to a more challenging one). Interesting introduction to finance... for whatever that's worth! Lectures can be watched at 2x, but are pretty dull. Exams are super easy. Coding assignments have skeleton code and take maybe 6 hours including tweaking (see http://quantsoftware. gatech. edu/ for syllabus and projects). Two reports are a bit more time consuming, but not difficult. Don't let the early semester reviews fool you into thinking this class is easy. The class starts out simple with minimal time requirements but will quickly ramp up about 3 projects in. The ML section in the second half is extremely interesting, but you'll be bored to death with the first half/midterm if you don't care for finance. \n\nThe projects are extremely interesting and well thought out, but Tucker often takes almost a week to finalize a project. Don't wait to start on projects as a few of them are very time intensive. Overall a great introduction to supervised and reinforcement learning and would highly recommend. As the other comments mentioned, the first 2 sections were very easy, almost trivial. The last third was really the meat of the class and very interesting. More involved. The first iteration of the class had many logistical problems with auto-grading. Hopefully lessons have been learned and future classes will be better. I really enjoyed learning about the financial side of trading and it was a good hands on ML use case.  The material: I am an avid consumer of economics, I am far from knowledgeble, but going to this class I feel like an astrophysicist wannabe ending up in a astrology class. It should be a FOREX course on the 'Get rich fast' channel on You Tube, not a class at GT. Last year I watched Andrew Lo's 'Finance Theory'course on You Tube just for fun, this year I can bearly get through this nonsense, with an exam pending. The way the class is ran: As people mentioned, it is poorly managed, close to 'Computer Networks', far, far away from KBAI.  Dr. Balsch does an excellent job of explaining concepts. I'd go so far as to say that he baby steps you through concepts in the lectures. The workload is very manageable thus far. I also find the material interesting. This has been a 'fun' class and not just one that I had to slog through due to requirements. I'd say that you can take this and enjoy the semester without a crushing workload. I also think that if you're in a hurry, this would be great to pair with another course.  If 7641 teaches you the theoritical part of ML, this course helps you understand the practical implementations of it and how it can be applied to day to day activities such as financial trading. Good amount of introductions to pandas, and financial basics are given, Wish more time was spent on ML, but neverthless learnt a good deal I thought the class became really involved past the midterm. It became more or less like the KBAI project where all the pieces you built (simulator, strategy, ML algorithms, training/testing harness) have to be ready to go for the final project. Any bug from the previous projects is going to cost you time in debugging. Also this class is also going toward automated grading testcases, so without test harness, I could see many people have trouble getting good grade on their projects. Had all the optional parts (implement boosting, ling and knn analysis, all parts of the final project scaled evenly) and test harness not allowed to share, i could see the whole class drops half-to-one letter grade average. By the look of the grade of final project, probably less than 15% people actually implemented QLearning trades generator, which is really the whole point of the class. \n\nToward the end, you are building a QLearning agent to do automated trades generation, which is quite cool to detach QLearning from the more common \"robot in a maze\" application. The future offering is likely to disperse the loads a bit more so the end project isn't so compressed where the common time working on them is upward of 30-40 hours. The future iteration also going to bring back Decision tree next semester, and \"deep learning\" at some point. This course has the potential to mature into a really good course.  Very good intro to NumPy and Pandas. I use Pandas professionally, and the exposure to NumPy (which is the foundation of Pandas) was very nice to experience. Tucker Balch is a great instructor and the TA's (Andrew Cassidy expecially) were excellent. The market fundamentals were nice to get to understand, and the lessons provided good information on them. \n\nAreas of the projects that would have posed most difficult (creating a decision tree algorithm ourselves) were covered very thoroughly in supplemental lectures. This took the overwhelming majority of guesswork out of the course, and instead tested the ability to implement, which I consider a good move. \n\nThe final project actually didn't grade on actual stock algorithm performance, which would have been extremely difficult (everyone is trying to beat the market, and thus very few can). Identifying unique stock signals is an important part of trading, and I didn't have the time (nor millions of dollars) to conduct satellite surveillance of AAPL's parking lot to gauge what the share price should be (this is actually done in real life). I think a good balance was struck on the final project regarding this. This was only my second course in the program and I am enjoying it. It gives a good introduction of some ML algorithms like Decision tree, Random forest, Bag learners. Later you learn Q learners and dyna and use that to the trading problem for the last assignment. Although you get a choice to use some earlier algorithms learned in the class, most end up using Q learner to solve it. It is advisable to learn some Pandas and numpy as they are used extensively throughout the assignments. I had a tough time using pandas for plotting graphs but managed it well in the end. Learning how array slicing works will help a lot. Also learning how to vectorize will shave some secs off your run time and you get bragging rights in slack and piazza for this. Make sure you are active on slack and piazza as tons of great advise are given by some great minds in the class. If not for slack, I would have struggled to understand and approach the problems on my own. And finally, the TAs in this class are a complete joke. You are assigned a specific TA and the one I had did not show up for the Office hour. Barring a few TAs, most don't help much and just ridicule you on Piazza if you ask something obvious. Having said that, I liked prof Balch's humor and approach. He supplemented the udacity videos with some youtube videos and that helped greatly for solving the assignments. Overall a great class. No wonder this is one of the most popular course in the program and more than 90% of the students end up taking this.  I loved this course. Very interesting projects. Get to learn and apply ML algorithms in Python. Good for the resume. Best course I have taken. <b>OVERVIEW</b>\n\nEssentially, the course serves as an introduction to Machine Learning, Technical Analysis for Trading, and Python (including Pandas and Numpy). If you're new to ML, Technical Analysis, or Python, this is an excellent first course. While the material effectively covers material sufficient for an introduction, you are free to take your learning further. For example, when learning about Reinforcement Learning, you can simply watch the course videos, or you can supplement your learning by reading the relevant sections from Suttons' book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction and the videos from the OMSCS Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning courses. The approach you take, combined with the skills you begin with, will determine how much time you spend on the course.\n\n<b>PROJECTS AND EXAMS</b>\n\nThe projects build upon one another, so if you get something wrong it is critical that you go back and fix it. Also, beginning projects early is extremely useful, because some projects require experimentations and papers. I was surprised at how a few students would appear on Piazza or Slack a few days before the project was due proclaiming that they had not started the assignment and was asking how long it would take to complete. Again, the approach you take will determine how much you get from the class.\n\n<b>ENGAGEMENT</b>\n\nI found the unofficial Slack community the most active - 24/7, especially in the days leading up to a project's due date or an exam. In many cases, students would answer questions in minutes or hours. Piazza was also useful, where some TAs were very active. Although, unlike Slack, answers from TAs or the professor ranged from minutes to days. I found my TA quite good and he would pull in other TAs when he couldn't provide a definitive answer. The professor was active on Piazza for the first half of the course, but was sparsely present during the second. Fortunately, the course proceeded smoothly with the head TA (who has previously taught the course) and other TAs actively participating.\n\n<b>TIPS</b>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Begin projects early</li>\n<li>Read a few research papers so that you can write your reports in a similar style</li>\n<li>View the course as an introduction and feel free to go as deep as your interest takes you</li>\n</ol> Good course. Practical introduction to machine learning. Should be an easy A. Funny professor, good laughs on Piazza. I really enjoyed the class, it gives a slow and gentle introduction into ML, python data science tools, and trading. Good class to take for the first semester. This class was really going well for me, considering i was taking it with KBAI. I was getting an A on all the projects but I couldn't do well on the midterm which was relatively a large part of the overall grade. The exam was filled with finance/stocks junk, unrelated with ML somewhat, making the class very annoying for me personally. I ended up dropping out of the class, only because i didn't want to waste time reading about stocks and finance, and wanted to focus more on ML concepts in general. The technical material was easy to follow, and not overly complicated, It could have been an easy A for me, if it was just ML. It would be nice, if they redesign this course, remove the finance/stock material, and rename it to \"Intro to ML\". This class has some fascinating aspects and some less interesting aspects. All of the harder parts in the second half are quite interesting whereas the beginning starts out a little slow and annoying with a lot of Python API introduction that could be done more efficiently (i. e. learn NumPy and Pandas API's on your own). \n\nThe class is worth taking for its own interest and also as an easy intro to Machine Learning. \nBe warned that the time requirements and any half-finished reports saying it is easy are very misleading. \nIt starts out super easy and lulls you into a false sense of ease which will be shattered one or two days after it is too late to drop the class. After the drop date you will suddenly find the time requirements go up by about a factor of 5. The hours per week workload in the beginning it is maybe 5 hours or even less but after the drop date it can easily jump to 20 hours per week or more if you are not a \"pythonista\" or try for bonus points. \n\nProfessor Balch is super engaged on Piazza which is awesome! One or two of the TA's are also fairly engaged but the rest generally don't help out on Piazza. \n\nMake sure you watch the schedule carefully. Make sure you pay careful attention to assignment requirements and always test on the GA Tech buffet machines or provided VM, especially for execution time restrictions. If you work hard, put in the required time, and ask lots of questions then the assignments aren't too hard and can be aced. However, messing up one assignment, especially from something silly like using a disallowed library or not making sure it works in the grading environment can cost you a lot, possibly even a letter grade for a big assignment. \n\nOne problem with the class when I took it was that the assignments were not finalized in advance, and sometimes not even until a couple days before the due date. Not only does this interfere with working ahead but having the requirements get changed after you already submitted is rather annoying.  This class is bringing up the frustration level like that other classes in OMSCS, that have been suffering through growing pains. The Class alternates between to simple and too difficult, and the professor is constantly updating the material slightly to account for problems. The exam was the proverbial \"sh*tshow\" of make up your own exam questions, and trying to answer them on the real exam in under a minute. Apparently people memorized the answers and blew the curve; not the intent that the prof had. I am sticking with the class so far, but I'll W out if it my frustration level increases anymore.  Precursor: this course was without a doubt made more difficult (welcome to the OMSCS!). I've compared it with students who took it on-campus a couple years ago and there's a staggering difference.\n2 closed book exams, rather than 1 open-note midterm.\nOptional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\n\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn't know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\n\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force. Don't underestimate some of the assignments. Start early or learn regret the hard way.\n\nThe workload is medium. Probably just the right amount of class-work for someone employed full-time. Sometimes I would have to devote all of Saturday or my entire weekend to the class.\n\nThe professor has nice lectures, but the reddit format was painful despite being a \"redditor\". Join a discussion late, and your comments will go buried. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that the class isn't the most flexible around the online student's time. You have to make sacrifices to accommodate the class's flimsical finalization of assignments, with short deadlines.\n\nIf I were to go back in time, I'd still take the class again. I signed up for this course because everything else was full, and I had considered changing my specialization to ML. \n\nVideos:\nTo be called Machine Learning for trading, only roughly\u00a0about a third of the class was about machine learning, and it's embarrassing for a graduate level class. I'd expect something like this from University of Phoenix, not Georgia Tech. The first 2/3 of the course require minimal effort if you're familiar with NumPy, as Pandas is pretty easy to pick up. The first 1/3 of the course is \"Hurray! Pandas is awesome!\" and taught in video by a TA. This videos are super short, and if you want to actually learn something about ML, read Mitchell's machine learning book and the papers it references. \n\nBooks:\nPython for Finance: skip. Everything in this book is online. \nMitchell's Machine Learning: If you want to actually learn the machine learning parts\nWhat Hedge Funds Really Do: Oversimplified, but an ok introduction. Used in the midterm, but way overpriced. \n\nThe assignment specs don't get posted in full until late, with many sharp edges on them regarding requirements. Most of the time you need to use Piazza and office hours to figure out what they actually want you to make. Assignments must be submitted with everything crammed into one or two *. py files. They also expect you to copy-paste code from your old assignment file into the next source file they expect you to make. Cool idea to build a module, bad implementation. \n\nTwo of our homework assignments were to write questions for the midterm, and we were graded (originally) on the acceptability of the questions. Seriously?\n\nTake it if you're in ML and need it, but overwise this class is too simplified to be useful in the real world.  This is a well-organized course brings machine learning and finance together. The content on each individual topic is light but the combination makes the course very interesting. I enjoyed the opportunity to apply ML theories, which are usual dry, to solve real life problems. My only suggestion is to merge the midterm and final into one test given the redundant questions.  ##### Overview\n\nLet me preface my review by saying that I went into this course really excited to learn about Machine Learning (with a mild interest in trading), having chosen to specialize in it through OMS CS. Unfortunately, this is a Finance class under the guise of a \"Machine Learning\" class. I put Machine Learning in quotes, because even Andrew Ng's outdated, free Coursera class provides a better introduction to ML compared to this one. By the way, there is zero mathematical background required for what is taught in this course, which is disappointing. If you compare the curriculum to Stanford/UC Berkeley/MIT, you will see that they are miles apart.\n\n##### What You'll Learn\nYou will implement: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Bagging/Boosting, and Q-learning. The rest of the course is about finance, with some Python syntax thrown into the mix. In addition, this course doesn't feel like a master's level class due to the amount of hand-holding it does (step by step instructions on what to do, you just need to convert it into Python syntax).\n\n##### Positives\nThe videos for this course are well-done, are interesting and are directly tied to the projects, unlike other classes. Also, because there's no curve, the classroom environment becomes very positive (not competitive) and people genuinely try to help everyone else. A class worth taking if you are interested in ML and Stock markets. Agree with comments I have read so far and I'll add my take. \n\nClass spends one third teaching you Python/Numpy/Pandas. Professor already indicated that will shrink that part. I'd feel torn at leaving it out. I had already taken the ML class and had to decide by myself if to learn R or Python while at the same time going through lectures and that was painful. So overall I'm on the side of leaving that part in but shortening it. \n\nI loved that professor asked to implement everything ourselves without relying to any library (other than numpy/pandas). There's nothing like implementing an algorithm yourself. Even something as simple as KNN has its tricks when implementing it. \n\nI loved that the assignments were somehow at par with the class. Every assignment is an increment over the last one. You get to build your own market simulator (or backtester). Stock trading strategies and then ML algorithms for it. \n\nProfessor was incredibly engaged throughout the class. He hosts several hangouts of an hour or more himself. He's amazingly active in piazza. Piazza becomes a firehose of posts and the professor replied to at least one third of them with followups. \n\nIf there would be a second part for this class I'd definitely sign up! High quality lectures, to me the best on this program. Concepts that could be complicated are made so easily understandable. Office hours are daily I believe, which is pretty impressive in my opinion. Projects very cool, but too easy. In fact, I think the issue with this class, at least this run is that we had not as much hands on as I thought we would. In any case, highly recommended.  The material here is interesting and I love the project structure. You gradually build up a Python module that includes all of your code from prior projects, ending up with a working market simulator that you can use to backtest trading strategies. That said, I feel the course suffers a bit from its Coursera background and desire to simultaneously be ML for finance students and finance for CS students. It's very, very easy, covering the very basics of portfolio management but only including long and short equity positions, nothing on derivatives, fixed income, FX. If you've used NumPy and pandas before, you can basically sleep through the first month of the course. I was hoping for more coverage of times series analysis and how to deal with non-IID samples, fat tails, heteroskedasticity, etc. , since we seem to just assume IID and approximately normal in developing ideas in the base ML course, but I guess this is a CS program, not a math or econ program. The other issue here is they're revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they're not releasing them on-time and we've ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on. Hopefully future iterations will get that worked out and involve a lot more programming.  Material is good. Assignments are easy mainly because of the way they are structured rather than underlying problems being very simple. Mini Course 3 (ML part) seems pretty good. It can be taken before taking ML course. \nBeing inter-disciplinary, ML4T covers data analysis in python (pandas/numpy/matplotlib stack), portfolio management basics, and of course ML. Hence coverage of each field might feel shallow to many people but it definitely is an intersting and very practical mix. \nIf your other course in the semester is very demanding (e. g. ML or CCA), ML4T can be a very good choice. If you are interested in trading, then it can give you a decent start, esp. given the effort to reward ratio.  Similar to comments above, we haven't done the ML parts though the ML parts look like a very quick overview of regression and reinforcement learning. Currently if you work heavily with Pandas and NumPy the course will be quite straightforward, however if you have never worked with these tools then there might be some learning you should do beforehand. Given my finance and Python background the course so far has mostly been revision for me so far. \n\nThe projects and homeworks have been Very Easy. In fact, one of them I solved with a single line of code.  This is an interesting course that offers good practice with Python and Numpy. We haven't gotten to the machine learning parts yet, but the finance assignments have been generally fun and interesting. I would recommend this class for new students because the coding assignments aren't terribly difficult for those with a programming background.  This course is very interesting and quite doable with an additional course. The programming part is not time consuming and most of it could be finished off in a day. The best part of this course are the TAs and the professor who are are super active on Piazza. This helps in sovling the queries very quickly and you feel involved in the class. Haven't given the midterm yet, so can't comment on its difficulty.  The first part of this class is a review of some Python/Numpy/Pandas functionality. The second are some basics of finance. And the third gets into the ML part. The pacing of the class could be faster and the content more comprehensive. One difficulty is since the pace is so slow I tend to forget but its not hard to relearn. \n\nThe assignments for this class have been Very Easy. One I was able to solve with a single line of code. The midterm is closed book, closed everything so I guess that's an opportunity to review everything and hopefully retain it all. \n\nThe professor has been very involved in Piazza and gives special live lecutres now and then which are very much appreciated.  A very enjoyable class end-to-end, with a mix of topics that keep it interesting. There are still three main sections: Pandas & Numpy, Trading/Finance, and ML. But the professor has continued to adjust the weightings to bring in the ML earlier and speed through the Pandas faster. \n\nThe projects are interesting, with only one getting tedious (because of a lot of picky details about charts and formats). Don't worry about some late criticism you may read here about \"unclear\" requirements -- while not perfect, they were plenty clear for anyone who was paying attention -- that is to say, most of the class. [Hint: if it's a Classifier, it has to pick categories, not averages. ]\n\nWhy not a perfect 5? Well, as mentioned the materials have been evolving to put more emphasis on the ML section. But what starts as well-produced, clear instructional videos gives way to a lot of fuzzy, hard-to-read slow-paced recorded in-classroom lectures with the occasional low-budget office hours to give important assignment instructions. It all works, but it's a bit duct-taped together. \n\nOverall a continually fun and interesting class with phenomenal instructor involvement. I like this one. As mentioned in other reviews, it's a good intro to ML, and exposure to many of the libraries you'll likely use again to manipulate data in Python (numpy/pandas). The professor is active and engaged. Lectures good, assignments for the most part good (lots of busywork generating graphs though). This is a good course that act as a good pair with 7641. While 7641 is strictly an academic exercise, this course gives a sound base for how machine learning works in actual industry.. Pandas could have been made a prerequisite than being part of the course... donno why all the negative comments.. This was one of the best run courses.. I have completed 7 subjects till date and never have seen a professor involvement so high.. A highly recommended course and an easy one too Professor Blach and the TA staff were awesome. The material is relatively light and I wish I took this course before I took AI. It gives a gentler introduction into NumPy. Loved the course. I learnt a lot in it and the assignments were fun. Good interesting course. Very well run and organized. Staff is responsive on piazza. You will get exposed to one application of machine learning. It is considered also as gentle intro to machine learning. Almost every 2 weeks there is a programming assignment in Python. Assignment in general are not hard and so were the exams. This might be my favorite OMS course. \n\nThe projects are structured incredibly well, each one building on the last. The course structure is very well paced and broken into 3 mini-courses - (1) Python/pandas, (2) Finance, and (3) Machine Learning. I learned a lot in this class and was inspired to learn more about computational investing. \n\nDr. Balch is awesome, and class/TA/prof engagement on Piazza was super-helpful. Plus this had the most Monty Python references I've seen in a single class so far. As we all know, the Monty Python Index (MPI) is a pretty good indicator of high morale. This course was one of the better ones I have taken. I would recommend it to anyone in the program regardless of specialization. I liked it. There are some organization issues associated with having a gigantic class, and a forced presence on Piazza (Piazza is chaos). The projects also aren't finalized until pretty late, but the changes were almost always nothing. But the class is interesting enough. Its a light introduction to machine learning, and a medium introduction to finance. You aren't going to leave this class and be Warren Buffet, or know everything you need to know to make a high frequency trader, but you'll have a decent grasp, and give you enough of a teaser to let you know if you want explore ML or finance further.\n\nClass itself was pretty easy. Projects could be easy, or hard depending on you. I spent a lot of time messing around, but if I had focused I probably could have finished things a lot faster and easier. \n\nId recommend it to someone who wants a light introduction to machine learning.\n\n The workload is tricky indeed - one can't be warned enough about the last 3 projects, you *will* miss deadlines if you do not approach them with extra time allocated. \n\nThose who say that course is disorganized - well, it truly puzzles me, as the course is one of the best organized ones. Huge plus is that python+finance+ML all covered well enough, and tied together, so you really able to learn something (and that something is relevant, not some outdated/unnecessary stuff). \n\nOverall, more courses like this! This is my first course in this program. I didn't have a strong coding background before taking this class, so you aren't worried. Professor and TAs are very engaged and active in piazza. The first two assignments are pretty easy, but the followings are getting harder. \nAll of the assignments are very funny, you will enjoy it. Good course. It started very easy and in the end it was a bit harder. It is splitted in 3 mini courses. I would have loved if the first mini course were shorter and the third one deeper. Personally I spent like 4 hours/week during the first weeks and around 16 hours/week during the latter ones.  Good introductory class to machine learning techniques. Projects were also pretty fun. If you have an interest in the world of investing or speculating, you will find this course interesting. Very easy towards the first 3 months. Last Month (Mini-course 3) gets very involved. So around 5 hours/week for the first 3 months and then 20 hours for the last three projects.  Very well organized class and the professor is extremely active on Piazza. The course material is very interesting and I highly recommend it. Some things are kind of silly - you can basically just memorize the answers to most of the midterm and final exam by answering sample questions over and over. I believe it's easy to get an A if you watch all the videos since many hints are given on how to complete the assignments. A good course with lots of useful content made frustrating by the disorganization of the instructor. Projects specifications are often modified after release without any formal announcement (in some cases, up to a few days before the project is actually due), meaning that you have to keep checking the specifications in order to make sure that what you have done still matches the what is required, and in spite of the army of TAs assigned to this course, it still took forever to get grades back for any of the projects (even when they could be marked via auto-grader) - as at December 16, we are still waiting on part of our grade for a project submitted back in early October. I am interested in the stock market, and I absolutely love this class! I wish there is a second follow up course. This course has lessons which give gentle intro. to python/numpy/pandas which I have not came across in other courses. Take this class before Machine Learning. I use what I learned and made more than enough money to paid for the course. Very useful, A++. This class was fantastic right up until the end, when the instructor sort of pulled the rug out from under some people. There was a somewhat subtle item in the most heavily weighted assignment (which was a paper and could not be auto-graded to test this). It was never explicitly stated what you should do about it, but if you did not implement it exactly the way the instructor had in mind you lost 30% of your grade on the assignment (4. 5% of your overall class grade). The requirement was never placed into the documentation, but it was apparently explicitly told to the TAs like some sort of \"test\" that the students be able to intuit exactly what the instructor was thinking. \n\nOverall, the class was great, but it left a very sour taste in my mouth at the end for Professor Balch. This course has been really great. One thing I would be wary of is not just trying to skimp on the work or starting late on the assignments. The first couple weeks will make this class seem really easy but you will get hit later as the assignments can get a little more challenging. \nOverall I think the class is great to learn about some finance stuff as well as getting some experience with some Machine Learning. This class is not easy, ignore all previous posts that say it is. The first couple of assignments seem light enough and then once you hit assess_learners it's very time intensive. Not the most difficult class but not trivial either; expect to dedicate a fair amount of time to assignments. \n\nAnother concern is that you will look at the schedule and think you have 2 weeks to work on something but really professor Balch won't finalize assignment details until the week before it's due. \n\nOverall a very interesting class with fun projects but the scheduling and workload were a bit uneven. A good opportunity to practice machine learning concepts like decision tree and Q-Learning. Also a good course for practicing numpy and pandas. If you have extensive stock trading or machine learning experience this course is probably too easy for you. This is more of an intro course.\n\nAreas for improvement: Since the assignments build on each other it would be nice if the grading was \n faster. Also the assignments often don't get finalized until within a week of the due date. This created a lot of noise on Piazza in the beginning of the semester, but after a few assignments students realized that the assignments probably won't change much between draft mode and finalization so it's okay to work off of the draft version. Just be aware that the <a href=\"http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Spring_2018#Assignments_.26_Grading\">assignment descriptions</a> are verbose so it is easy to miss a detail. I think improving communication regarding the assignments could save time for everyone by reducing the noise on Piazza.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this course.\n 8 projects (67% total) and 2 Exams (12.5%/each) account for the majority of your final grads, the rest points are almost giving it for free. \n\nFor each assignment, you can check the project details here (http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Fall_2017#Assignments). Do notice that each project is tagged as Easy, Moderate, Challenging, and Very Challenging. That's based on Professor's own experience, and MAY NOT suit your case. For me, the hardest project is manual_strategy, which was labeled as merely Moderate, while the Very Challenging one feels like a breeze. So, don't assume the time it requires for each project has a direct correlation with the difficulty labels. You may put yourself in an awkward situation. \n\nAnd regarding the exams, you'll need to answer 30 multi-choices within 35 minutes. You might argue about the limited time given, but trust me, it's perfectly sufficient to finish the test. I completed the Midterm & Final within 20 mins, and I still got 10 mins to go through each question before submitted it. No hard calculation, just concepts/ideas and shrubberies. If you could not answer it within seconds, I highly doubt that you could get the right answer out with more time given.\n\nOverall, if you 1) are interested in learning financial strategies, or 2) want to apply the ML approach you acquired to investing, or 3) need a intro-class before taking Machine Learning, I highly recommend this course. Machine Learning for trading is an excellent course. It's a great starter course, as it isn't too difficult, but beware that the difficulty does ramp up towards the end of the course (though it still doesn't get exceptionally difficult) so don't let the first half fool you into thinking the second half is just as easy. Lecture material is very interesting, essentially being split into half-financial and half-intro to machine learning.\n\nThe projects all build upon one another in some way, so it's advisable to spend a sufficient amount of time making sure each one is done properly. You can work ahead, as all project descriptions and legacy code are available on the class website, BUT, the projects may change slightly closer to release so keep that in mind when you work ahead. **DO NOT** wait until projects are finalized before you start working on them, despite the chance some slight tweaks may be made to projects up to the week before it is due, start them as soon as you can. This is especially true with all of the projects starting from and including *assess_learners*. \n\nI would suggest making sure your *marketsim* project works perfectly when you get there. The most time consuming projects are *assess_learners*, *manual_strategy* and *strategy_learner*, with the latter two using your *marketsim* code, so make sure to allocate enough time to work on these when you get there. Also, for *manual_strategy* you will have to do some research into stock price indicators, and this project is used as a comparison for *strategy_learner* so it's good to choose these indicators wisely based on this research.\n\nThere are two proctored exams,  one mid-term and one non-cumulative final exam. Questions aren't difficult as long as you review all of the material, watch all of the required additional videos (e.g., The Big Short), and go over the practice questions/previous term exams where possible.\n\nAll-in-all, the material is interesting, the projects are overall well-structured and utilize the material conveyed in lecture, and often even have instructional videos to help guide you through some of the more involved projects.  TAs were responsive and easy to reach on PIazza, though Dr. Balch is often very helpful he can be a bit curt. This is an easy course especially for students with some ML background. Dr. Balch is a great person. He is very helpful and quick to respond. I also like his sense of humor. I liked the fact that we coded a decision tree and the q-learning algorithms from scratch. This course also can be paired with other difficult courses, such as machine learning or AI. Love, love, love this class!  A very gentle and applied introduction to ML.  It also teaches you NumPy and pandas from scratch.  There is a lot of info about this course publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/.\n\nThere are 8 projects in the class, and for the most part they increase in difficulty as you go along.  The first two were almost nothing; they can barely be classified as projects.  But it makes sense because they're supposed to serve as introductions.  All of the projects were very interesting and fun to do.  I have no previous ML experience (except for some basic boosting/bagging from CV but that was hardly a decent exposure, as much as I enjoyed CV) and that didn't hurt me in this class at all.  It was so cool in the final project to program a trading system based on machine learning and look at the results.  Code is tested on real stock data from real companies with some made up companies thrown in every now and then.\n\nAll of the project info is available ahead of time (see the link above) with the caveat that everything is in \"draft mode\" at first and will be \"finalized\" later.  For some reason this was a huge problem for some people in the course.  They refused to start until the project was finalized, which is kind of stupid on their part.  We were told repeatedly not to do that and that any changes made would be minimal.  The biggest change that I remember is in the second project.  We had to optimize something different from the previous semester's students.  Aside from that I think one or two other projects had a minor change and all the others had literally no change.  People blew this draft mode thing way, way out of proportion.\n\nThere is a proctored midterm and a proctored final.  Both are closed everything.  The final is not cumulative.  The midterm was extremely easy and was almost a regurgitation of previous midterms.  It sounded like that won't always be the case.\n\n3 textbooks.  One is required and is co-written by the professor.  It's fairly cheap (especially for a textbook) and is a pretty good read.  You'll definitely want it for the midterm at least.  The other two books are Python for Finance by Hilpisch and the ML book by Mitchell.  I can't remember if those two were actually required, but I didn't find them completely necessary.  The lectures were enough.\n\nIt's often said that a finance background is helpful for this course.  I think what people mean is a trading background, not a finance one.  I have almost no finance background but I do have a relatively extensive trading background, and that helped a lot.  I think manual_strategy would be the most difficult for people with no trading background since it requires an understanding of technical analysis and indicators.  This stuff isn't too difficult, but it is a lot to learn on top of everything else if you're new to it.\n\nThat's kind of true of the course in general.  It's not that this material is difficult, it's just that there is sometimes a lot of work in a short timespan.  If you have a good background in Python or trading then it'll be less work, of course.\n\nThis is a good first class if you can get in your first semester.  Also, this course potentially pairs well with other courses, depending.  I paired it with IIS and had no problems.  If you have no Python background and no trading background then I don't recommend taking it over the summer.  But, I do recommend this course in general overall. I had been eyeballing this course ever since it showed up in the list of future offerings, so I was glad to be able to take it before I graduate. This is a fine course and most will enjoy it very much- I certainly did. The typical first-run course snafus with project definitions and scheduling were compounded by some medical problems that the instructor had during the semester, so our experience might not be all that representative going forward. That said, almost 2/3 of the semester were spent on just getting some basic concepts down for python and finance, and we didn't even approach any ML until almost November. The projects themselves were fine. Because of the problems that I mentioned, we had a short runway to complete some of the projects (we didn't get the description of one of the projects until after the planned due date had already passed), and they had to shuffle the syllabus around a bit to accommodate (including dropping the final exam). I assume that wont be a problem in future semesters. They went away from an autograded project to a written report on the later projects, and finishing the report proved to be time consuming for me. But they are flexible and provide 5 late days for projects that you can use however you want during the semester. \n\nGreat instructor and staff, and a fun course. You will enjoy it! Highly recommend this class, even if you are not planning on ML specialization this class can provide a good introduction to ML concepts. I found projects very interesting, they provide a good hands on application of ML.\nDifficulty depends on your background but don't think it will be too hard even if you don't meet the class prerequisites.  Engaging course run by a professor who has good industry experience. Cumulative approach to projects where each one built on the previous one. Overall a very enjoyable course. The final assignment which involves building an RL trading agent is the toughest one - if you can complete it then you already have a head-start on the RL course ! This class is definitely a basic introduction to machine learning, with more of the class focused on using NumPy and Pandas and a few financial markets topics.  In terms of difficulty, most of the projects are very straightforward, and Professor Balch provided additional videos that walked through pseudo code or algorithm outlines.  Two of the projects are more challenging, but still reasonable.  I would have preferred that some of the early easy projects be combined to allow for an additional machine learning project at the end.  The huge class size (~700 in the online portion) exposed that there are limits to how high a class can be scaled before execution problems emerge.  This class pairs well with other classes, as long as attention is paid to the higher workload in the last few weeks of the class.\n\nPROS:\n\n--Lectures were clear.\n\n--Professor Balch was active on Reddit nearly everyday.\n\n--The material was interesting and a good example of how machine learning is applied in a single industry.\n\n--There seems to be some measure of updates and improvements each semester, so there is an effort to refine the course over time.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n--The amount of lecture material is light, particularly in the second half of the course.\n\n--Management of the course was often sloppy.  For example, the course started a few days late, project requirements sometimes weren't \"finalized\" until a few days before the due date, important clarifications of project expectations were sometimes contained in a single post buried in the Reddit megathreads that were hundreds of posts deep, messages to the class were infrequent or incomplete, it was often impossible to submit a project to T-Square until two days before the due date, wording of exam questions was often vague, and the checks for course participation were essentially abandoned halfway through the course.\n\n--There was very little feedback on projects.\n\n--The grading was slow for some of the auto-graded projects and participation quizzes.\n\n--It was a challenge to search the Reddit megathreads that were often several hundred comments deep.\n\n--Professor Balch's tone on Reddit sometimes didn't come across as very encouraging.\n\n--Some of the additional assigned shows or movies (e.g. The Big Short) weren't at all relevant to machine learning.\n\n--The answer key used to score the final exam had two incorrect answers (Professor Balch eventually acknowledged one mistake, but stood behind the other even though it directly contradicted an assigned video).\n\n--Professor Balch's frequent references to Monty Python are distracting and could be confusing to those that aren't native English speakers. I liked this course, if you like machine learning and are interested in trading enjoy.  I really enjoyed this course. I took it at the same time as Reinforcement Learning (very manageable to take these 2 at the same time). I see others recommending taking this before ML; I actually took machine learning first.. so I can't really comment on whether or not that is a good idea. Dr. Balch and the TAs were active on piazza and in office hours, particularly in the last half of the course (where you actually need the help). \nOverall, you should take this course. I managed to get an A while learning a decent amount, and if I can do it... so can you! Absolutely fantastic class. Professor is one I will never forget. Well thought out assignments, well planned lessons, and I learned a TON. Quite difficult, but thankfully there's an autograder to help you figure out whats wrong and fix your solution before final submissions. I absolutely loved ML4T, the instructor and the TAs are awesome. \nThe subject is very insteresting, the lectures and projects are well designed and organized.\nThe only thing missing is that the projects could be more challenging.\nThe professor is working on making the course more challenging, but it is still easy in my opinion.\nDespite that, I think it's totally worth it, I learned a lot and I recommend it to everyone. tl;dr: Tucker Balch, what an experience. Take this course. \n\nI came to it with hobbyist Python and 2 years in fixed income software. ML4T taught me from-scratch numpy, a handful of ML concepts/strategies, and a small taste of how equities managers from RenTech to Berkshire view their markets and trading opportunities. The numpy skills would have made it worthwhile alone, but you learn so much more if you give it the time it demands. \n\nTucker encourages a lively Piazza, and supplements the official lectures with plenty of extra videos. \n\nI found the exams challenging but fair. Read the official study guides and previous exams. Ignore the student generated stuff. That worked for me. \n\nThe course left me with an appetite for more ML, so that's what I'll take next. Entirely unexpected, but speaks to the quality here. This class taught me a lot about finance, but having been through ML, RL, and DVA (first run), I did not find this class particularly enjoyable. While it was neat to learn some Pandas and see the application of ML to the stock market, much of the ML application didn\u2019t come until the latter third of the class. I\u2019ve taken 9 classes in this program, and this one was the most disorganized that I\u2019ve ever taken. Assignments were typically changed within a week of the deadline, submission windows were not open in a timely manner (in a couple of cases, only two days before the deadline), and Piazza was so noisy it became difficult to differentiate posts of actual substance (which may be credited to having 500 students in the class). Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity\u2019s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester. Overall, this is a class that should be taken prior to ML as a sort of introduction, due to its low workload and introductory material. The material itself is interesting, but the grading methodology is garbage and communication is poor. Expect random unpinned forum comments to change or be the sole source of information about major project expectations. If you miss a couple of minor nuances in the projects because they are not officially mentioned anywhere and you didn't read every single one of the ~thousand Piazza posts, you could lose a full letter grade or two, even if you know the material through and through. I enjoyed the first half of this course, but the second half has me considering quitting OMSCS. I'm still new to the program, so my review may be slightly influenced by my disappointment in the way classes are managed in this program, but I am majorly disappointed that this class is one of the highest reviewed courses in the program. I definitely had a much more professional and all around better experience getting on campus degrees where I felt that my grades actually reflected my subject knowledge. \n\nI certainly learned a lot from the class material, so I don't feel like my time was wasted entirely, but everything else has been disappointing. This course starts slow by introducing numpy and pandas. The first assignments are pretty light. In general there is a lot of hand-holding with the assignments.\nIt can be challenging and time consuming to put together the projects but you can start as early as the first day of the course. It's really up to you.\nMaterial is interesting and the professors seems to be genuinely enthusiastic about both, trading and machine learning. If you have had no previous exposure to machine learning, it could be a more or less painless intro to it.\n\nI will say, however, this is a huge class and piazza is a mess most of the times. As others have said, the course seems to have been revamped some to make it more difficult now than it was in the past. It's not horrible but don't go in thinking it's one of the easiest courses in the program, it's not. There's a lot of good in the course but it currently suffers from poor execution and a lack of communication making the course way more stressful than it needs to be.\n\n\nThe lecture material is good, the assignments themselves are relevant and have the right level of challenge. Unfortunately most of the assignments were not released when they were expected to be. Assignments would be released in \"beta\" form a few days or even a week after we were expected to start them. and then sometimes not \"finalized\" until a few days before the assignment was due. This is troublesome because some of these assignments do need the full allotted time to work on them, and if you waited until an assignment was \"finalized\" you would pretty much guarantee that you don't have enough time to finish the assignment. This wouldn't be as bad if it were minor tweaks being made, but the \"beta\" version was typically just the previous semesters assignment and there was no clear communication on what changed with each iteration of the assignment so you are left analyzing every line of the assignment over and over to make sure you don't miss some gotcha that could cause you to lose substantial points.\n\n\nThis is my 9th OMSCS course and this course in its current form isn't very friendly to OMSCS students who typically have full-time jobs and other responsibilities outside of school. In addition to the above issues, assignments also were not open for submission until a day or two before the due date in many cases. So even if you had worked ahead, you  still would need to plan around having an internet connection and submitting your assignment the day it was due. There were also random participation checks on the forums, punishing students who didn't check every day. In general it is structured in a way that prevented students planning around their life, and instead they must plan their life around the course. Most OMSCS courses I've taken have been more flexible in this regard. Students who suggested changes to the course to improve it were met with snarky comments from the professor on the forums.   \n\n\nIn general I can't recommend the course in its current form unless your willing to deal with the above headaches. There plenty of much better run OMSCS courses. One of my top 3 favorite courses. Professor Balch is very involved which is awesome. The TAs were very good as well. Was one of the more \"fun\" courses I've taken in the program so far. If you are really interested in the stock market and ML then this is a great class. This class won't teach you advanced concepts around the stock market or ML but it gives you a solid base to build on. One of the pieces I really enjoyed was implementing the ML algorithms vs. just using them from a library like scikit. This class is all in python (which can be good/bad). As I already was familiar with python, the first couple of weeks were fairly easy other than learning the ins and outs of the numpy and pandas libraries. The projects definitely ramped up as the class went on but I really liked how the professor made each project build on top of each other. As long as you stay on top of your projects, build out your projects modularly, comment your code well, and don't overly procrastinate this class should be relatively straightforward. The midterm can be a bit tricky with the programming problems but the professor did provide a great study guide - use this and you will do fine on the midterm! Also, Professor Balch is extremely active on Piazza which was a nice surprise (I was not expecting this). Disclaimer: this was my first OMSCS class so I have no other OMSCS classes to compare this to.  Very straightforward course, approximately 80% of the course grade is programming assignments/labs. These will most ofteb be less than 20 lines of python, but code-reuse is common from lab to lab, so bugs will quickly propagate and cause headaches later. The lectures are interesting, if a bit slow. Overall they illustrate the concepts well and make the labs straightforward. \n\nTake this class with a more difficult one- I took it alongside CSE 6220 and found the balance to be excellent.  For the most part this is an \"intro\" course for finance, machine learning, and the programming libraries used (numpy, pandas, and python in general really). If you are already an expert in all of those areas then this course will probably not be very informative, but otherwise the course should work well as a first look at those topics. Especially if you are a novice programmer, I would recommend this as one of the few in the OMS program that involves a lot of coding but does not assume much previous coding experience. In terms of both finance and machine learning, only the very basics are covered, but you will get practical experience working with both in the assignments which can help if you decide to pursue each further in the future (such as by taking the Machine Learning course). \n\nIn terms of the course structure, it is heavily programming project-based. The early assignments are very simple but the later assignments become more involved and give more room to go beyond the minimum requirements for extra credit. In the semester I took the course, there were many major problems with grading the assignments which was the only major downside of the course in general. Assuming those issues are resolved for future semesters, the assignments overall are fun and apply the material from the course well. The course was supposed to have both a midterm and a final exam, but the final exam was cancelled due to logistical reasons. The midterm exam was fair in terms of questions although it did involve a lot of memorization for things like library API details and financial formulas. \n\nOverall I would say that if you are interesting in learning the basics of these topics and like working on small programming projects this course is a good choice.  This is my favorite course offered so far. I was already very interested in the stock market and this has me hooked on ML. So much so that I changed my specialization. \n\nOf all my classes I have ever taken these had the best projects. They were close enough to a real world example that they made sense and each one built on the other until you merged them all together at the end. \n\nIf you fall behind you are toast because you will use the previous project on the next project. \n\nIf you do the work and put in some effort it should be a fairly easy A. But, there is a lot of work. \n\nAs a bonus, you will get introduced to Pandas which is my favorite add-on library for any language. Although the course was not hugely challenging, I think it gave a great starter how to use Python and build Machine Learning algorithms. I feel much more confident now using numpy and pandas which has set me big time for the next courses and data mining in general. Building the KNN learner from scratch was AAA+... I can now look at any of the sklearn algorithm's and I know the concept they use to declare, fit and predict, which makes it much easier to deconstruct the inner workings of sklearn and other python based ML algorithms. \nFinally professor Tucker was great, he seems like a busy man with all his extra curricular activities but was very involved in the class day to day.  I was looking forward to this class immensely, haven taken the previous version on Coursera. Its an extremely interesting class in finance and machine learning. You will learn the basics by which to model and test theories for trading. Its a well done course and assignments are quite structured. The instructor is awesome. \n\nI wish the class was harder and covered more material. Its a great intro, but a follow up classes would be even better. \n\nI would liked to see more on how to implement systems at scale, quantifying different signals, methods on how to automate trading with API's, etc. \n\nHighly recommend. Amazing class, super interesting material, great as an introduction to the program.\n\nDifficulty is lopsided - certain projects are a breeze, while others are much more difficult.\n\nPositives:\n- Great intro to ML, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Finance\n- Very interesting material\n- Manageable workload\n- Have all of the base work done to create machine learning trading strategies for real systems!  I am seeing if I can apply my strategies to cryptocurrencies for fun.\n\nNegatives:\n- Projects / Homeworks were often not finalized even 1 week before the due date.  This made it difficult to work ahead.\n- Some exam questions tricky / unrelated to what was reviewed in coursework.  Two questions on the latest final were about locations in the Big Short movie - who cares? This was my fifth course in the program, and it was one of my favorites.  I really enjoyed how direct and to the point the lectures were without overcomplicating the material.  I also liked the fact that the professor provided supplementary videos that guided the students on how to tackle projects.  A big portion of this course is getting familiar with numpy and pandas.  Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market.  A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions.  For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results.  I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students.  My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.  For example, you could lose 10-20 points for forgetting to put your name.  Staying active on slack is very helpful, because people will often point out important points in the directions that you might miss.\n\nUnfortunately, you will most likely not learn enough from this class alone to apply machine learning strategies in real life situations, but the class will give you a strong foundation if you are interested in exploring that field.   Love this class! The projects are very well designed and all build upon each other nicely. The second half of the course is a bit random at times (additional youtube lectures in addition to the normal Udacity lectures) which is due to additional resources added to the class over time. This semester we used Reddit instead of piazza for the discussion forum which works fine for me (although there are complaints from other students). Just keep up with the lectures and projects, remember check in regularly and you'll do well in this class! This class is the easiest OMSCS class I've taken. It gives intro to python/pandas and finance. Then has a part on ML. \n\nThe ML was very informative if brief. I believe it is a good quick intro to ML and this class would be good to take before the ML class.  This class was phenomenal. I haven't taken any ML courses before, and this seemed to serve as a good intro. The course is divided into three modules - basically numpy applications to finance, intro to finance, and machine learning (with a focus on finance). \n\nThe ML projects were the most work. It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken. \n\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity. The projects largely build on each other (most projects reused code from previous ones), so it's essential to stay on top of them. \n\nThe instructors and TAs were generally friendly and very active on Piazza. There was around a week near a critical deadline where they vanished which proved to be quite frustrating for many, but in the end I think being very active 15 out of 16 weeks vastly surpasses the quality of interaction I've found in other classes. This is my third course at OMSCS. ML4T is a fun course and well run.  Professor Balch is enthusiastic about the material and is highly engaged in running the course day to day, which I think is really important for an online program. I've enjoyed the projects a lot - they give a nice intro into the various ML concepts as well as pandas and numpy. This class isn't the hardest I've taken, but it's not the easiest either. It feels like a pretty good balance, and an excellent first class to take. The projects are not a wash and require a good time investment.\n\nIt's been my largest class with 500? people I think, which leads to the one drawback - it's difficult to stay on top of the Piazza threads and participate meaningfully. They just explode very quickly around project deadlines and before exams.  I  know it's something Professor Balch has been experimenting with, such as using reddit last term. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this course.", 
    "CS-8803-001": " Personal background: This is my first semester and I paired with course with Computer Vision. I don't have formal CS educational background or software engineering working experience. I have been programming with Python for a year or so to prepare for the application of OMSCS. I have taken college maths classes (which I dont think is used in this course).\n\nAbout the class materials: The lectures are very interesting and well structured. Probably not wide/deep enough. But the research challenge arranged by the instructor provided good opportunities for self-exploration and learning from each other. It is a pity that I did not spend much time on it. The hardware challenge also seems very interesting. I am not a hardware person myself but the things classmates posts are really impressive. \n\nAbout the instructor: The instructor Jay is very nice and effective. He almost answered/hinted every question on piazza. In a few cases when I twisted my wording to hide my stupidity when asking questions, he seemed to understand my intention and hinted on my confusion directly. I really appreciate his efforts in running this class well.\n\nAbout the projects: Project 3 is challenging. There are too many details that can mess things up. I decided to give it up to get a B but the deadline was extended.  So I \"had to\" work on it for another week and eventually I scored 6 out of 10 test cases and managed to get a A. (I lost 4 points because my solution was not designed to deal with certain situations due to lack of energy).\n\nMy lesson from project 3 is\n\n1) you need to really understand what SLAM is doing exactly in each step (same for the other algorithms taught in the class) . Only after that you can correctly modify the implementation. It seems a lot of classmates claimed that there is bug in the SLAM code. But it did work, at least for some other classmates and me. \n\n2) read and participate in the discussions on piazza. I had to make numerous decisions for the project and I did not have the time/patient to try them out. For learning purposes I listed the pros and cons for my options but most of my decisions are based on the comments from the instructors and other classmates. Sometimes even 'typing' the question helped me figure out the answer immediately. I heard from the instructor that it is called \"Rubberduck debugging\".\n\nFirst class?\nIf you know python and know how to plan to \"solve a problem\" and execute your plan, I think you should be fine. For me, most of the difficulties of Project 3 in the first two weeks came from my messed up code and code structure, which made it very difficult to debug. course content is only for 6 weeks and first project was fun to do. Optional second project was a tough one. But final project took a lot of time for me, as none of the topics covered in the class comes handy to do that project. Overall, I loved the subject Great course. Enjoyed a lot as I knew some concepts and it helped at my work.\nNot for 1st year due to increased difficulty level in projects and grade requirement to be in the program.\nA project can have sub divisions effectively making it more than one project. Projects carried 70% score. Get guidance from Piazza discussions to attempt at them. Beginning of class and up to lesson 3 it's a breeze and less hours is ok but after that the lessons are comprehensive and requires more work to understand. Few projects are all or nothing. 0 score in one project can push the grade downward (A to B or B to C).\nPython programming basic level is ok as many helpful code (copyright) are given to use in your implementation. \nBut to score good in projects which require time-bound outputs advanced level - using numpy, pandas, matplotlib for visualization - may be required.\nTAs were helpful and replied almost instantly to queries on Piazza. I was able to front load a TON of the work and there were about two weeks of doing absolutely nothing waiting for the final. With that said, the final project was pretty dang tough. If I had only taken this class(and not Machine Learning and Machine Learning for Trading before hand), I would have NOT been prepared. The learning curve is very strange, the 1st project(Runaway Robot) had some hard moments, but then final project really through me(and many others) for a loop. The lectures felt very... shallow and I do not think they adequately prepared me for either of the last projects. \n\nI would have much rather had more time spent on some of the concepts, better lectures, and better Udacity quizzes. \n\nThis class really feels like it needs a face lift. \n\nOverall, I would say this class(as it stands right now) could probably be paired with another easy/medium class. Just be wary of the final project and carve out plenty of time for experimenting for it.  So, this is my honest review of the class. The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don't recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming.  In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don't get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\n\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don't pass any of the test cases, you don't get any marks. It doesn't matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\n\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\n\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available. It was an easy course with a final project unrelated to the course which made the project difficult. \nthe course material and videos were good, \nBut the involvement of instructor and TAs was not satisfactory. I don't even know them. \nThis would not attract the students to involve more, which is a necessary thing in an online program. \nI felt they don't care about the class and students enough. The lectures are very simple and basic, and do not provide enough depth to complete the projects. Expect to spend a decent amount of time reading to get up to speed for the projects. Overall, I loved the two projects, but was a little disappointed by the lectures. This class is easy for the regular assignments and quite fun at times. Professor Thrun is extremely positive and encouraging and makes you feel like you just solved the greatest problem when you complete an assignment. \nThe course allows you to work ahead at your own pace which is really important because the final project requires a lot more time and effort than the regular assignments so you want to \"front load\" this class to give yourself more time for the final project. \nDue to being able to complete the assignments ahead of schedule this class lends itself well to being done in parallel with another class by disciplined students (i. e. don't think you can leave stuff to the last minute, do it ahead of schedule and then relax ;) ). \nProfessor Thrun is busy running Udacity so he isn't generally involved on Piazza but the TA's are excellent and Dr. Thrun takes time about once a month to have live Q&A sessions with students.  In general, I agree with all the posts from my Summer 2017 cohorts. Great content, unbalanced projects requiring deeper dives outside of lecture materials--and time requirement exponentially growing in latter projects. Could have been way better managed--really wanted to love this class. \n\nGreat content, generous of Dr. Thrun for the two office hours, valiant attempt by a single TA running the class. Failed to impart any real understanding beyond the pre-packaged video content due to fear of releasing any real help (or content for future sessions) by openly discussing the problem both before or after the fact. Missed learning opportunity. \n\nAgain, the TA being overtly secretive about revealing approaches (not their fault) to the solutions produced the wrong kind of struggle for students. (Vastly different from ML4T, CP or CV--where you're guided to spend time focused on the right problems. ) And prevented forming a deep understanding of the mechanics of the concepts presented. Instead, this lead to time-wasting, misplaced effort and lots of wheel-spinning. The second downside was that once the project was completed, there were no real discussions about how each student approached and solved the problems\u2014hence you\u2019re left with whatever understanding you had without any affirmation or new insight as to the different approaches taken. \n\nThe lead instructor (not Thrun) was barely involved and didn\u2019t seem to be in touch with the class other than to chastise the class for possible violation of the honor code. To be fair, the generous curve at the end provided some relief but overall, it was pretty stressful (in the wrong way). Great course. The third and final project is by far the most challenging part of the course! Course is really easy in the beginning, but more difficult at the end. Very interesting class. You'll get out exactly what you put in. The concepts are explained well and the homeworks are good practice with the algorithms. Some of the homegrown python classes are a little frustrating to get used to, but nothing too hard. There are two parts at the end of the class that are harder than the rest. One uses quite a bit of linear algebra and the other is a project. I haven't quite completed the project yet but it takes a considerable amount of time and effort to complete.  Overall a polished class, but I didn't feel like I learned much. The flow of the class is great and you always know how you're doing in the class and what you have to accomplish each week. The TAs, Herman and Jon, were excellent and very active on the forums. Professor Thrun keeps the lectures interesting and shows great enthusiasm for the topic. \n\nUltimately though I didn't feel like I got what I wanted out of the course. The connection to robotics was superficial, all of the code is in Python with no hardware required. The algorithms taught are used in robotcs but I didn't feel like we went in depth enough into them that I can comfortably remember how to use them without looking them up again. The class could honestly use a required hardware component (rather than extra credit as it is now) to flush out the classes connection to robotics. \n\nIt has a group project component worth 40% of your grade. The group project has the flaws of any group project in an online course, being tough to coordinate with other team members and no way to hold them accountable.  Interesting topics, easy quizes and easy projects. The last project is a bit more difficult, but really not much more difficult. I ended up using very little from what I learned in class in my last project. I would probably change the projects to be a bit more engaging. Good lectures though.  The lectures are overly simplified. (The book is a lot more dense). The quizzes are very easy if you follow the lectures, and they even provide the answers. So you should get a B at the very least just by doing all the quizzes. The final quiz run away robot is not easy but not difficult either. Just study kalman filter (search the web for more accessible tutorial) and you'll do fine. The optional extra credit is tough (lots of noise). The final group project is a hit or miss. It can be tough if you have bad teammates who dont contribute or MIA. But it's very much doable by one person. You need to research on technique outside of what is taught in the lecture. They give you a lot of time (2+ months) so it should be ok if you start early.  Overall this was a pretty good class. Professor Thurn makes learning about robotics and AI interesting. His lectures are well thought out and engaging. The class consisted of 6 assignments (done through Udacity), a Runaway Robot project (done through Udacity), and a final group project (done offline). The TAs for the class, Herman and Jon, did a great job as well. There are some advanced concepts like matrices, vectors, filters, and some calculus that require some brushing up on if you're not familiar with them.  This was a good class, though I think some of the materials in lectures are covered at a shallow depth. If you take other OMSCS classes like computer vision you will see some of the same topics covered more rigorously. What makes it interesting is the office hours with Dr. Thrun - so even if you are completely comfortable with the material, it is worth viewing the office hours to hear him answer questions. The other part of the course that is nice is the final project and optional hardware challenges allow you the chance to try to apply the concepts to real systems. If you want to get the most from the class you should try those optional challenges because you'll learn far more about robotics if you start trying to make them work on actual robots :).  I think this class is targeted at a more general audience than MSCS students, and lacked the additional depth and formal treatment from the (optional) course textbook. The mathematics are not very advanced or sophisticated (trig, probability, and some calc), but they can be a stumbling block in the projects. This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester. \n\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later. \n\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort. \n\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.  This courses has been the most disappointing course for me in OMSCS so far. I will admit that I have no prior experience in robotics and I felt that I will learn the concept along the way. The lectures were frustrating , skim in details and glossed over necessary mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. I spent many hours over them but was still not able to understand the maths. The TAs though active did not do anything to help you understand these concepts. The office hours with Dr Thrun were of no help either. \n I just felt that they are deliberately trying to hand over B\u2019s and C\u2019s to students. You can confirm that from grade distribution for Spring 2016 where only 48% people got an A as opposed to 80% in earlier semesters. I have no problem with getting a lower grade as long as the subject simulates my thinking and helps me understand the concept. I wasn\u2019t able to grasp any concept taught in the class , as the projects did not require any application of the concepts. This course might have been tolerable in the past when 80 - 90% people got an A when the instructors understand that the material provided in this course is too superficial and graded accordingly. But instead of improving the quality of the course , they decided to add vigor by making testing harness hard and by ensuring that 50% people should get B or lower. If you miss one single test case , you will lose 10 - 12 points and then there is no coming back. (Hint : Please confirm for runway robot1 , which values can be negative. It will be obscurely defined and if you miss it you will be done. ) \n If you get lower marks in project 1 , promptly withdraw from this course. (No please don\u2019t fall for we will consider hardware and software challenges if you are in between grades. There were 5 software challenges and 4 hardware challenges and if you do them all , they will account for 1 mark. ). Stay away or learn all maths before hand.  The class is not easy for those who do not use math or work in robotics for a living. I liked the class but it was a challenge for me. I do think the ratings on this class at the time I took it are very deceiving. Perhaps others didn't need the time I took but the projects both required quite a bit of time. I am an accomplished programmer, and that helped, but I should've taken a linear algebra refresher before this class. Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning.  Covers quite a bit in a single term, so there isn't as much depth as I had hoped. Assignments are of average difficulty, perhaps on the easy side. Workload is pretty light, especially when you get to the second half of the term and work on your project.  The course doesn't have a huge amount of content, but some of the concepts could be hard to understand if you haven't seen them before. The Final Project was a big challenge but the team was able to find a way to do it.  The Runway Robot project required some thinking and additional readings because it is not very obvious how the concepts learned in class can be applied to Runaway Robot. The final project is challenging. Most of the time will be spent on research and trial and error. It is recommended to work as a team instead of tackling it by yourself. More people can try different approaches.  Very cool class, really neat to understand the algorithms behind a self-driving class. I really enjoyed Sebastian's lectures and he is BY FAR my favorite instructor through 4 classes of this program. In the summer our final project was to predict the future path/projection of this incredibly random-moving toy thingy. The other projects were great, but this one was very hard to relate to the rest of the class. I would have preferred a different final project having to do more with the class contents, but it was still a great class and I'm sure they will change up the projects from semester to semester.  Was already familiar with many of the algorithms that were covered in lecture. Later strategies were interesting. The projects are a whole other beast as they test much more than what is covered in lecture. Compared to other courses such as Computational Photography or Computer Vision I would say the projects are 'easier' conceptually but 'significantly less straightforward' to implement.\n\nEg a project which was basically 'implement particle filters' which I've implemented at least 3 times before took 10x as much time to finish as in other classes. This is due to a lack of scaffolding provided compared to other courses (you have to integrate your code and write almost everything that's not related to the core algorithm). I will say they did cover how to implement particle filters quite well. Just that the bulk of your time in the projects is not spent on the core algorithms the lectures cover.\n\nThe projects build on one another so if you didn't manage to get earlier projects be ready to devote significant time on later projects catching up. Lastly the grades are all or nothing (very much like real life) unlike other courses which test each part of the project separately.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the concepts taught in this class you will struggle with having enough time to implement them. That being said the lectures do cover the material quite well. It's just due to the all or nothing nature it'll be hard for you to know whether it is a bug with the algorithms or an integration bug somewhere else.\n\nSemi extra credit in terms of additional projects/challenges was offered, but I don't consider them realistic given the time devoted to core projects.\n\nI would NOT recommend this to new students to the program. For the final project around 1/3 of the students got 0% on the grade on a piazza poll and less than 1/2 got >50% due to the all or nothing nature.\n_____\nTip for project 3: Ignore almost everything that is suggested for this project by lecture. The biggest challenge is not related to what the project seems to want to test you on at all. If you waste your time on the algorithm covered in lecture. You won't have time to work on the actual time consuming part of the project. You won't even need anything you implemented in Project 2 or Project 1B. Just use the strategy from Project 1A to deal with inputs and focus on the real challenge. Learned this the hard way when I ran out of time and discovered my optimized implementation wasn't even needed or used in the final solution. Also for the mini project before hand, there's a significantly simpler alternative that's much easier than the suggested algorithm. Save your time for Project 2/3 instead of the miniproject. This a good course, requiring decent amount of (hard) work. It will strengthen your problem solving skills (and expose your limitations). \n\nTo succeed, you should (a) get started on the main assignments early; (b) make sure you get a solid understanding of different (first half of the video lectures); (c) make sure you have enough time to try different techniques (or work in a team for the final project). \n\nIf you do not do these basic things, you will complain. \n\nRemember that each point counts and some mistakes are inevitable, so make sure that you do not take it easy. \n\nThe TAs do a good job in grading the assignments on time and asking direct questions on Piazza. \n\nIf I may suggest some improvements for the course:\n\n1) The course lectures, assignments, Piazza discussions do not go into much depth. Ideally, this course would have resident Robotics experts, i. e. , people who do this for a living. \n\n2) It might be a good idea for the instructors to ensure that students are indeed learning different techniques (e. g. , SLAM). A midterm or final exam would be helpful. \n\n3) Encourage or even enforce the \"AI\" part in \"AI for Robotics\". Needless to say, providing help on these techniques (e. g. , the math for some filters) would be key. \n\nIn a summary, it's a good course to take (and to score a good grade in), especially if you are not in an \"auto-pilot\" mode. \n\nI come from a SE background, so I had some reservations taking a course that would require some math/physics. But my fears turned out to be unfounded.  This class is different than the others I've taken in OMSCS. It's largely working in isolation as the quizzes are all in Udacity and Piazza is often a ghost town. Dr. Thrun's videos are really entertaining andinformative. The TAs are phenomenal. Probably the most engaged and verbose TAs I've encountered in the project. Ask a question and you'll get more detail than you'd have expected. \n\nI think this class just needs some way to push interacting with the rest of the class. I know a lot of people take it with another course. This makes sense due to the flexible timeline of completing projects, but it leads to people doing their work quietly and moving on. Which is a shame because this material can be dense and it's nice to be able to play ideas off of others. \n\nBut I definitely recommend it.  Similar to others reviews from summer 2016, I signed up for the course as a good fit for the shorter term. \n\nIt may have been a good fit in summer 2015. It isn't anymore. \n\nThe lectures are engaging and very well produced, bringing you to a 4/10 familiarity with the topic. The first project requires skills at a 6/10 level. A reasonable leap to expect from masters students, especially with high level collaboration encouraged on Piazza. \n\nThe final project requires skills at a 10/10 level. No further instruction is provided. The grading is adversarial (based on your success compared to others), destroying the piazza community. \n\nI would still consider this course, very carefully, for a full length semester. The extra few weeks could make the final project just barely reasonable. Unless the course is overhauled, stay away during the summer. This course suffered greatly from a lack of leadership. With two lecturers listed as being in charge of this course, you would think that one of them take the lead and run the show. As it turned out, however, neither of them seemed to be particularly interested in putting in any more than the bare minimum amount of effort and the whole course was more or less run by the two teaching assistants. The end result was one of the deadest courses I have taken in this entire program. This might not have been so bad, except for the fact that the two major projects for this course don't really match what has been taught in the lecture videos. That means that in order to actually get through the projects, you pretty much have to go out and learn some pretty difficult material by yourself without any instructor support. With better instructors and projects that better mapped to the lectures, this could have been a really great course. As it is, I would steer clear unless you're looking for a course with a relatively low time commitment to pair with something harder and don't really care too much about learning anything. The dedication of the TAs is impressive. They prepare introductory videos every week, always share materials related to the course, and are quick to respond to questions. The course is very manageable as all materials are in Udacity and are available right from the start. The video lectures are very easy to follow, however I feel that I need to do some work outside from what the course requires for the knowledge to be ingrained. \n\n(Update)\nSomeone asked if you get to learn more advanced techniques in AI4R... \nI am a total noob, so everything is advanced to me... I guess it is how you make of it. The course gives you many opportunities to learn more advanced techniques, but you can complete the course satisfactorily (I guess) without doing so. \n Throughout the lectures and the problem sets, it feels like you are being assisted like a 5 year-old: everything is well explained, you wouldn't notice much if you do not have a good grip. The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging. You really needed to take a big leap, read a lot more and explore other possible algorithms to solve the problem. Most of my classmates talk about using an algorithm not even discussed in the lectures for solving the Final Project. \n\n The TAs are very helpful. They do their best to up the participation, even create interesting videos every week. When somebody asks questions, they are quick to dive in. And when they do, they do not just answer: they give expounded explanations like how things might be different for other cases. But this course can actually be done even without interaction with others, so Piazza is sort of quiet.  These surveys are pretty deceptive. This course is easy on the surface. The math and problem sets are easy at first, but escalate very quickly to linear algebra concepts and calculus that you better remember. On the face of it, Thrun is the instructor, but he only has 3 scheduled office hours, and the second one was a huge bomb. The TAs were super active first 3 weeks, and then activity level is at a 1/10 near the project time. \nThe time given for the final project and runaway robot is inadequate in terms of following the weekly plan. I front-loaded, but still was crippled by the math (lots of trig and rotational motion) for the RR( runaway robot). Groups formed off super early, and it's all cliques of people with too much brain power together to make it fair for grading according to their head-to-head rubric. I am not disappointed in the course, but yet again - the amount of work required is deceptive and is >>>> toward math as opposed to CS.  Great class. Having a 'real world' professor with such a motivational spirit really makes a difference. You get the best of both world, a lot of heavy concepts, but a lot of real world examples. Don't plan on Sebastian being very available in the forums or weekly office hours, remember he's got 4 jobs (at least), but when he does, it is so much fun. I was able to join a team for the final project and work with a Lego MindStorms EV3 to implement PID line follower, localization and the start of a SLAM. It was awesome to be able to do our own proposal and our own work, much more engaging! The course overall is very good. It covers many important concepts in Robotics that are also important in other classes/fields. The instructor, prof. Thrun, is considered one of the pioneers in his field and has a unique teaching style. Also, the TAs were really helpful and know their stuff. \n\nThe class is divided into two parts (lectures with homework) and (two projects). The first part of the course is pretty straight forward. The second part has two projects: the first is the runaway project which involves some linear algebra. The second project is pretty open where you are free to implement any of the algorithms taught in the course to solve the problem. You can also use any other algorithm you want as long as you mention that in your report and say why you used that. \n\nTo prepare, I advise:\n1. having a python prior experience (Udacity: Intro to CS is a good refresher). \n2. Artificial Intelligence experience (briefly skimming through Udacity's Intro to AI lectures can be helpful) This was a great introduction to OMSCS for me - it was the first class I took. The course lectures were great and helped give a good introduction to the topic. The projects were interesting and really made me work to use the concepts of the class to solve them. I really enjoyed this class. Pros:\n- Lectures are very good and content is super-interesting.\n- Projects are fairly well-constructed and released bug-free with sufficient lead time.\n- Instructor and TAs were responsive and helpful.\n- No exams.\n\nPotential Cons (depending on your point of view):\n- Workload was highly variable.  Weeks without projects were pretty tame, but projects could be fairly time-intensive.\n- Success on projects was highly non-linear.  For most of them, your solution either worked or it didn't.  Points were awarded for individual test cases that were all fairly similar.  The instructor-provided test harness provided examples, so you weren't totally in the dark, but testing wasn't done in a cumulative fashion where each successive piece of code was built on a previously tested piece.  You've got to construct your own tests and debugging process, but hey, that's life.\n- The lecture content and especially the projects are deep-dives into filtering and path planning.  This is core stuff, but doesn't include the breadth of concepts involved in automated cars, much less robotics generally.  There was no machine vision or reinforcement learning content.\n\nOther Notes:\n- 100% Python\n- No group project, voluntary or otherwise, unlike some previous semesters\n- Taking 6601: Artificial Intelligence beforehand isn't required, but probably helpful\n\nMy grade: A The course is very good. The video lectures are well designed and natural to follow. The projects are VERY time consuming, challenging and they force you to learn a lot. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the course, I felt there was a gap between the lessons and the knowledge required by the projects. This made me seek the content in many other sources. The textbook is depth but it is way more difficult to understand compared to the video lectures. In one hand, the gap between the depth of the textbook and the shallowness of the lectures can be viewed as a problem, but in the other hand, it induced me to learn from other sources.\n\nThe instructor and TAs are very good, supportive and present throught out the whole semester.\n\nOverall the course is great, the projects are really fun and I recommend it to everyone. Initially the course if fairly easy but the difficultly quickly climbs up after the first two assignments. Workload was around 10-15 hrs per week initially but in the last 4 weeks it was over 30+ Hrs per week therefore I would advice that do not pair it with another difficult course. If you are planning to take two courses then this should be the \"difficult\" course and then other one should be \"easier\" of the two. \n\nI was able to get an A in the course and did fairly well but this course is a very hard course. Like others have mentioned the difficulty of the course has changed over time. The last \"sensor-warehouse\" assignment was apparently an extra credit assignment till last semester but from Fall 2017 has become compulsory assignment and is 20% of the course therefore if you do bad on it then it could affect your grades significantly even if you might have been scoring more than 90% up untill that assignment. \n\nThe TAs are super helpful and they encourage students to share their solutions and learn from each other. Almost all assignments can be solved in multiple ways both taught in the class and otherwise. \n\nFinally, having said all that I think this course is fantastic (but hard). Knowing what I already know I would do it again. I did this course with Intro to Information Security, but if I were to do it again I would do it as the only course as the learning outcome would be much higher.  The course has changed. The last Project which was recently added is tough. \nThe Senior Lecturer and TAs are supportive.  This course is very interesting. One reason I love this course is that it tells the most important concepts in robotics in the simplest way. The advantage is that you can easily understand the concepts, but the disadvantage is also obvious that you don't understand where these concepts come from and you have no idea how to practice them when facing a complex problem. The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy.  Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions. So, overall, how much you learn from the course is based on how much extra work you paid to this course. One bad side of this course is that you either receive 100% or 0% for project or homework, so a lot of students will receive above 95% for the overall score. So the cutoff for A will be most likely 90%. Here it is right up front- don't underestimate the projects.  The level of effort for most students in the course seemed to indicate these projects were also time-consuming for them.  There were certainly people who seemed to tackle the projects with ease, but they were right there the entire time helping their fellow students.  More experience would make things more manageable, but even with the skills, there are lessons for everyone in this course. \n\nLet me sum this up.  You are a GA Tech student! This means you are not afraid of hard work or challenging problems.  The course material is intriguing and immensely practical.  The lessons learned in the process will vary, but you will improve beyond the lessons taught in the classroom.  You could not get more relevant and interesting projects.  Give this course a shot if you are interested.  The course materials, professor, TAs, and other students will make this a course you will remember for a long time.  Good luck!    Took this along with 6310 in my first semester. Was very easy - you can get pretty far ahead on the homework, and then just sit and wait for the projects. As long as you don't dilly dally on the projects, they are pretty easy to figure out. Project phase was definitely harder but nothing to stress about. Terrible course. The lectures are completely lacking. They only touch the surface which is not sufficient for understanding the material. The assignments are hard and require you to understand the material. The suggested reading is really required and is incredibly dense unless you're willing to put in the time. The lectures are essentially the office hours. This was the only course I've had to drop at GT because it looked impossible for me to do well in it and I really was not enjoying it. Great class!  The lectures had a nice progression for concepts with quizzes, but they did tend to mostly give you only high level understanding of concepts.  I found Prof.  Summet to be very helpful and responsive on Piazza.  As others have said, the projects can take a long time.  The udacity assignments (problem sets + mini robot) should be 100% and that covers about 40% of grade.  Be very careful about falling behind on project 2 as you'll want to have a good implementation of it as project 3 is a very difficult extension of it.  I think all told I spent close to 100+ hours on projects 2/3 together.  I would highly recommend a TDD approach for these later projects because they can get pretty complicated and finding bugs once the system is fully built can be very difficult.  Most of the assignments and early projects culminate in the later ones so if you fall behind or have a bad project early plan to spend extra time on the later assignments. Course is a great concept. Thrun lectures are great. But as noted lectures are not tied closely enough to the projects, nor are they going into grad level detail and math that the projects demand. \n\nSummer 17 project 2 was crazy hard out of nowhere. Needs to be more carefully planned for a summer accelerated term. \n\nFinal project : a good group is your best bet. There is a ton to do and try. Did the most learning on the final project, so a rewarding part of the class, but very time consuming. Very open-ended class ; not a huge amount of work actually required to get a grade, but there is quite a bit to learn if you take the initiative to dig deeper This is a very interesting and enjoyable class. It's probably the first class I had that was almost entirely work at your own pace as you could finish all the assignments and the Runaway project as fast as you want. \n\nThe course on it's own can be easy, but if you really dig into the concepts I think it's rather challenging if not simply hard. I reviewed many lectures to really gain an understanding. That being said, you could easily do this course with another. \n\nThe only wildcard is the group project. In this program people have families, jobs... so coordinating with people all over the place can be challenging. I probably put more time in the last few weeks on the final project as I did the rest of the course. \n\nGreat class and you'll probably be thinking about the Runaway and Final project well after its over.  A great class if you want to learn how to build a self driving car from a software point of view. Taught by arguably the worlds foremost expert. \n\nThe class is actually quite easy and a great first class for OMSCS. What I learned most from the class is how statistical mathematics is applied to robotics and algorithms. It was very interesting how robots deal with noise and uncertainty. \n\nOne part of the course covers how robots can make optimal decisions given a state. The idea and some (but not all) of the terminology maps nicely to Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning and MDPs. \n\nOverall the class is extremely well done and polished. Highly recommend. The lectures are quite easy to follow as the concepts are explained on rather banal examples. Completing the first project requires either very creatively applying the course material or to go beyond the lectures. P2 was a bolt from the skies. The first part is easy, the second one quite hard and the third one was a nightmare so its status was changed to \"extra-credit\". P3 is a project seemingly detached from the course content. You can apply some of the course matter or use any other method outside the course (which I think most people did). Do not underestimate project workload and start VERY early to avoid getting into a trouble. Grades were pretty generously curved in the end (A for 84+). The structure of the class means there's a lot of work at times, and then it's pretty dead other times. You begin with six weeks of fairly interesting lectures + online assignments that aren't too crazy. Then you have three weeks or so to complete the first project. If you had a good grasp on the lecture material it takes maybe 3 to 5 hours to come up with a working solution, though I spent 20+ hours trying and failing at the extra credit portion. Then the class ends with a larger project that definitely requires you to comprehend and do research beyond what was covered in the lectures. You can work alone or in groups up to four. I valued working in a group to be able to bounce ideas off others. In the end probably spent 5 to 10 hours a week for the five weeks we had to work on it. There was also an extra credit option where you actually build a robot and implement some of the ideas of the course, though unfortunately I did not get time to engage with that aspect of the course. \n\nCompared to other classes this one had a less interaction with staff or other students, perhaps because enrollment is smaller and there were less assignments. The instructors were not particularly active on Piazza. There were three office hours which were constantly rescheduled and even with few Piazza posts there was often slow turnaround for responses. There was a small group of students, though, who were quite active and helpful. Overall, I really enjoyed this class.  I enjoyed most of the projects and found the lectures to be enjoyable.  Be careful about the last project in the class which is insanely difficult.  All of the other projects were doable and really enjoyed them overall.  This was my first class I did for OMSCS ever and while I enjoyed this class, I'm not sure if I can recommend it as a first class to take mainly because of the last project and how little time you have to complete it especially if you work full time.  The topic is really fun and interesting and there are no tests and papers as well which is a big plus. This class covers several interesting concepts on how to program a robot to act on its own. The TAs were quite involved and very good. Professor Thrun met with the class four times and was very witty/informative. I repeat, the subject matter is very interesting and quite timely to current events like the google SDC. \n\nHowever, to me, who is over half-way through the OMSCS program, this class felt far too simple to be a graduate level course. It was far away the simplest and least time consuming class I've taken. Even though the final project was a group project, I was able to program the primary working code we chose to use in a couple nights and a Saturday. Ironically, the final allowed for algorithms not covered in class. I actually think this would have been more challenging had they required use of only course-covered algorithms (i. e. particle or Kalman Filter) or variants thereof.  Both TAs were extremely valuable and helpful in this class, their calibre easily head and shoulders above their peers (That's why they were chosen as TAs). Dr. Thrun's live and direct involvement in this class is nothing short of amazing and awe-inspiring. This triumvirate is the essence of why one should aspire to be computer scientists and roboticists!\n\nWhile I wholeheartedly agree with my peers and don't dispute their personal experience gained from this class, I felt that I had some difficulty in some areas because of my lack of recent knowledge in certain areas. That's why I spent so much time, mostly in catching up, then in applying that to the contents of this class. \n\nWith respect to team project, I consider myself lucky that I was able to choose my team mates and that my team mates chose me. We had excellent synergy and I have to humbly admit that they carried me quite a bit in this course. That made a great difference in team project experience!\n\nI wished I was more prepared before taking this course, but not having taken any ML or CV courses weighed heavily against me. If I did, I may have shared my fellow classmates' sentiments. \n\nAs it stands, I learned quite a bit, more than I expected when walking into this class. It was extremely enjoyable and a real eye-opener!\n\nMental note to self (and to anyone else): Don't bring a knife to a gun fight! I agree with the above 3 assessments. It is a very shallow depth and I wish I felt like I learned more. The final project was fairly easy to do, especially in a group but I felt like I could've done it by myself. Our group had a decently working project a month before it was due and then we just tweaked it until we turned it in the week prior. The class just overall wasn't very challenging. It is an interesting subject but I wish there was more I don't have a background in this stuff, so it was a tough class as I had no preparation in ML and such like another commenter here said. I wish I had a better idea of how to be prepared, but I did enjoy the class a lot. The material was worth it. The TAs (Jon and Aaron) and Sebastian were great. They took a suggestion I had on practice problems and it seems ot have really helped. I wish my previous university had people like them. I will say that this isn't a class that's easy for beginners, but it is for those with a good background. Fun class and I recommend it. I have no regrets in being in this program.  I have a background in this area from undergrad hanging out with my school's DARPA challenge team. I liked this class a lot. The homework is in python and has good feedback by immediately running on the server. The topics covered are not in depth, but really are the algorithms and equations you start with when making a self driving car. Think of it as an introduction. Also, I'm glad I took this class the same time as Advanced OS. Having one easy class is nice.  This course is really interesting and covers several topics that are important to know in robot localization and tracking. The videos and the teaching methodology are great. Definitely and easy course to pass and get a good grade (considering you put the effort). The main challenges are the Runaway Robot and Final projects. The RR project gives you the preparation that you need to start the final. There is plenty of time to work on all the assignments. The grading is fair and the TA communication is constant. Despite the professor's busy schedule, you get to meet him in the Q&A video sessions. I definitely liked this course and recommend taking it.  This is probably the most easy course in the CP&R specialization. Lectures are very light, can be watched in a week. The course teaches python along the way without you knowing it. All the problem sets are available in the udacity free course along with solutions and thus 30 points are assured. However, the projects require intuition into the topics taught in class. The runaway robot project is available on udacity and this was our first project. There is an optional project being added in this semester which may become mandatory for future offerings and then this course could require more time. Overall, I enjoyed this course. The only con is the lectures are so light that it makes the concepts deceptively simple, however you have to do lot of searching on the net to gain a deep understanding. The course lectures are very interesting and have a lot of hands on programming in them. The projects are very difficult and time consuming. It is not something that you can just do the weekend before it's due. There were 6 small assignments (one per lecture), only 2 required assignments, and one optional project. We were able to do the final project in groups, which helped a lot. Piazza seemed to help a lot less here than it did in other classes. The course starts out quite easy, probably 6 hours a week or so through the first project. Once the second project started things changed, probably 20-30 hours a week for the rest of the semester. The second project hadn't been assigned as mandatory before and it was not really ready to be released. There were a lot of issues with the descriptions and grading of that project. Hopefully it will be smoother in future semesters. The final project seemed impossible at first, but if you just experiment with things you have learned in this class (or other classes) you will find you can achieve decent results. So my two pieces of advice for the final project:\n1) Write a good script to test with. This will really help with #2\n2) Experiment with different approaches. Just try things. Overall I implemented 5 approaches and fine-tuned the best of those five. \n\nLectures: Not many lectures, only 6 but they were of good educational quality though some of the in lecture quizzes had a bit of disconnect from the instructions given in the \"intro\" video for the quiz. \n\nHomework: You have a homework set for each Lecture. The answers are given during the lecture so you should be able to get a perfect score here. (30% of your grade)\n\nProjects: As noted above the first was pretty straightforward. The second was pretty hard and a bit of a mess for our semester at least. The final project can be done in groups if you want, that might help with my advice above about trying different approaches. I went solo and got a good score. (Projects are 20%, 20% and 30% of your grade)\n\nI believe our professor said the class is being handed-off to a new instructor next semester so things could change... This class was so much fun! The professor invented the Google self driving car and uses the course to elaborate on how some of their algorithms work. I was hoping that we would get to design on our own algorithms that could be run through a self driving car simulator of sorts... but the projects are much simpler than that. The Lectures were intriguing and the TAs were responsive! This class wasn't extremely time consuming, but the final group project was quite challenging conceptually. It would definitely help to have a stronger background or refresher in geometry and trigonometry in order to do well in this class. I found that while I understood the concepts well, I struggled with the mathematics a bit.  24% Problem Sets (6)\n36% Runaway Robot Project\n40% Final Project\n\nProblem sets and the runaway robot project are auto-graded in Udacity. You are done once the auto-grader passes. \n\nFinal project, optionally in a group, requires studying a robot's motion over 60 seconds (1800 frames) in a box with a candle in the center followed by predicting its motion for 2 seconds (60 frames) as accurately as possible. \n\nThe lecture videos are excellent. Some of the problem sets are very challenging, but all in all, not too bad. The best part is you can work on the problem sets and RR project on your own time. I was able to finish them in the first month of class and focus on my other courses for the next two months until the final project. This is an advanced math course. You need to know vector calculus and linear algebra to be successful. If you don't know how to calculate a Jacobian, don't take this class. \n\nI withdrew after 5 weeks because I couldn't do the math. I was especially frustrated because none of the advanced math was covered in the lectures. Coursework is trivial through most of the term, however if you don't keep up the final projects will be extremely difficult. Videos are very engaging, but I felt like Thrun was completely disconnected from the course - stopped in for a couple office hours only. Amazing TAs this term, overall one of the top 3 courses in the program.  The lectures and their associated problem sets are great. Dr. Thrun is a phenomenal teacher, so you can expect to enjoy learning what he teaches in the lectures. We also got two office hours with Dr. Thrun, which was awesome - he answered every single question, both times. \n\nBeyond this, the class is rather messy. It feels like they tried to take a short, free Udacity course and turn in into a full semester's worth of work by extending it with two projects that go beyond the scope of the lectures. Essentially, there's the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they'll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it's very difficult to do so. You'll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it's not (unless you're already familiar with the math and robotics). \n\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you'll just have to go for it, however if you don't need it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester. Hopefully in the near future (like ASAP) they'll fix this course. \n\nTo end on a more positive note, if you don't take this course, I highly recommended doing the Udacity portion on your own. It is very cool to learn from Dr. Thrun. I took this course along with DVA for my first semester. I liked DVA, but I thought this course was much better - I loved it. \n\n**Positives**:\n\nDr Thrun's lectures are fascinating, and he has boundless enthusiasm for the subject. That enthusiasm didn't just come through in the lectures, but in the three office hours he gave throughout the semester. These office hours were interesting too, and he took questions from students ranging from project implementation details to research and industry topics. Pretty cool.\n\nDr Summet's office hours were very useful, and he held them every week. He was also very involved on Piazza and personally answered many student questions. \n\nThe projects are fun. The course doesn't cover *that* many topics, but you will become an expert in A*/DP path planning, Kalman/Particle filters, and PID control. When/if you finish the projects, you'll feel proud. And if you're like me,  you'll replay the Python scripts over and over once you're done just to watch what you made.\n\nIn my semester, the students on Piazza were valuable and supportive. \n\nThere were no tests, and the homework answers were given for free (they still counted towards your grade). No group projects. You'll have many weeks to prepare for most of the projects.\n\n**Negatives**\n\nThe projects really seem all-or-nothing. They use an automated grader to score your projects, and you'll probably have to spend double digit hours just to maybe get a tiny amount of points from the sample grader. The real test cases they will grade with are not given in advance, but sample cases are provided that closely match. Don't underestimate the time commitment you'll need for those projects. We had a week extension on the last project, and still many people reported that they could not get *any* points on their test runs before having to turn it in. \n\n**Tips**\n\nPython is heavily used, and it will be valuable if you're already familiar with it. Start the projects right when they become available. Try to do the projects in stages, like making sure you have basic functionality before meeting the full requirements. \n\nI wouldn't go so far to say that the lectures didn't cover what you need for the projects (like others have stated). The core of my logic for every project was solely stuff we learned in class. That being said, there are implementation details that will take a while to work out, and parameters that will need to be heavily tuned. You'll have to get creative. I would like to give this class a better rating because I really enjoyed the material and Dr. Thrun, and it fairly well organized in some ways. However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures). If you have some experience with numerical computing, and Python, then you should have no problem with this course. The assignments start off easy, and become progressively difficult, culminating with two challenging projects. The final project can be done in groups, which is helpful, since you need to do some research and analysis in order to find a solution. Finally, if you have the time, and are inclined to work with real hardware, there are optional hardware challenges which you can do for extra credit. You have quite a bit of freedom with these projects. Among other things, students in our class built robotic cars, quads, lego kits, and motion-controlled cameras. In conclusion, this is a fun course, which is not very difficult, and leaves room for exploration.  I would like to counter the opinion that the course is easy. \nFirst of all, the video lectures by professor Thrun are not very good. He does not explain the material well; he just goes through quizzes most of the time and you have to figure it out by yourself. In addition, he goes through concepts very quickly, so unless you already have some background knowledge on the topic, it's difficult to understand the concepts. \nMost of the topics in the class require solid math background (Calculus, Linear algebra, Probability and Statistics). If you are not good at math, forget it. I previously took CN, SDP, and KBAI and got A's on all of them, but had to drop this class due to problems with math.  Purpose: For those interested in autonomous vehicles.\n\nTopics Covered: Basics of statistics, route planning, and navigation.\n\nCourse Placement: Intermediate python level class but starts from very basic buildings blocks so beginners can easily build up their knowledge over the course of the class.\n\nTime Commitment: Workload starts off ~5 hrs per week ramping up over the course to 30+ towards the end.\n\n2nd Class: Not advised but possible for intermediate to advanced students.\n\nNeeds improvement: Learning advanced topics is left completely up to the student and you can pass without ever touching some of the topics discussed.\n\nGrade in class: A.\n\nUseful Prior Knowledge: Path finding algorithms like A*, stochastic programming like Monte Carlo, and a good understanding of geometry are very useful.\n\nRecommendation: Definitely recommended if at all interested in the field. Projects are easily conceptualized and interesting while allowing a lot of flexibility in developing solutions. Extra credit projects allow you to build your own robot or applications of topics learned in the class.\n Lectures: Lectures will give you a high level understanding of the material.\n\nTextbook: Textbook is mathematically dense. If you aren't math savvy, this is a waste of your money.\n\nProjects: Very little guidance is offered on approaching the projects (which is the majority of your grade).\nThey do simulate a \"real-world\" problem, which is great, but can be solved using geometry. By the way, the lectures are completely unrelated to the project.\n\nOverall: I put 10 hours of work per week, because that is how much time you'll spend going through the lectures/problem sets. But to be honest, you'll spend WAY more time on the projects.\nHere is a breakdown-\nProject 1 - 20hrs\nMini-project: 30 hours (based on Project 1)\nProject 2 - 50 hours (based on Project 1)\nProject 3 - 100+ hours (no, I am not exaggerating)\n\nAt the end of the course, many people posted that even though they've taken several other courses in the program, this was one of the hardest ones. Interesting course. The first half of it is very straightforward, you can easily front load the videos and quizzes from Udacity. Unfortunately, the video lecture series are short and honestly insufficient for the final 2 projects that determine your final grade. The final project is very difficult - start immediately when you receive it. With the limited materials provided by the course, you will need to conduct your own research and reading to discover a solution that works and this discovery process can take days to weeks. Do not underestimate this course, this is not an \"easy A\" anymore and will kick into high gear in the second half of the course; be prepared to work hard. The project 'Runaway Robot' is what you have to look out for. The rest of the course is pretty easy and light. I love the way he breaks down larger concepts into small managable chunks that you learn the large theory by stacking the smaller chunks of concepts ontop of each other. It's heavy on math and stats like most AI courses but it's pretty managable. That runaway robot project is by far the hardest thing i've done in along time but its mucho fun and when you get through it, you get an elated feeling of accomplishment.  The video lectures and class as a whole felt very watered down to me. Every lesson seemed like it should have been the introctory lesson for a topic, instead of the whole topic. The projects were interesting and open ended, but overall I never felt like I learned much from the class. (The BOOK , on the other hand, seems like an excellent resource) My favorite class so far. This class was interesting, challenging, provided instant feedback, motivational, engaging, and FUN! I learned a lot and went far beyond what was required by the course. What a great course. And prof Thrun ws phenomenal. What a treat. Only downside is it doesn't count towards the robotics specialization. Oh, well. Highly recommended.  This course was a lot of fun. The lessons focus on very practical methods for solving real-world robotics problems, and theory is often not emphasized as much as implementation. This course has less of a heavy workload than many of the other courses, especially early on before the Runaway Robot and Final Project parts. Part of that is due to how streamlined the assignments are, the coding is built into the Udacity interface so you just write code and submit it like a normal quiz answer. I much prefer this method over the methods used in some of the other courses where you have to setup your own environment locally and worry about packaging everything up for graders to be able to reproduce it on their side. I spent a very long time on the final optional Runaway Robot part and completing it felt like a big accomplishment even though it was autograded like every other coding assignment, so just because there is an autograder doesn't mean all of the assignments are easy. The Final Project is extremely open-ended and lets you explore whatever topics from the course interest you and apply it to any domain. I really enjoyed that flexibility because I could choose a topic and project that I found interesting and wanted to put a lot of time into. You will need to write Python code for all of the assignments but as long as you have some programming experience you should be okay, if you find yourself lost early on you can probably learn Python from other resources online as you are taking this course. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you are taking another course with a heavy workload and want an interesting course that you will learn a lot from that is more flexible on time.  I enjoyed this class. The content was very interesting and the TAs were helpful and active on Piazza. Content was completing problems on Udacity (24%) in Weeks 1 to 6, runaway robot (36%) and the final project of predicting the future location of a small robot (hexbug) (40%). I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest. \n\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project. \n\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A). \n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda! \n\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work. \n\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution.  Very interesting topic with great programming exercises and projects. I enjoyed this class a great deal and learned a lot.  The content, instructor, and TA (Herman) were all fantastic. The course is very well designed. The office hours with Sebastian Thrun were icing on the cake. The guy had indepth knowledge of everything related to robotic, AI, and self-driving cars. The course content was pretty easy. The projects could be done with minimal effort or with extrodinary effort depending on how much you want to put into the class and therefore get out of it. The inline quizes were perfectly paced and helped solidify concepts before building on them. Everything is done in Python and nothing very complicated is required.  Fantastic class both in content and instructors. Professor Thrun was a great teacher and Herman a great TA. Course covers several filter variants (histogram filters, Kalman filters, particle filters) as well as path planning and some basic control algorithms. The course could perhaps have been faster paced and covered more, but the slow pace allowed the opportunity to do some further self study. The runaway robot and final project allowed the opportunity to apply course concepts and additional self study. I'd highly recommend this course.  The best class I have taken in the program so far! The material is largely self-paced, so you can get way ahead if you choose to. Professor Thrun is very entertaining and holds regular office hours to answer student questions in a Q&A format. You do not need the book at all for this course! I purchased it thinking I would reference it, but only cracked it open once or twice and would not buy it again. The only criticisms I would make are that the assignments make use of a custom Matrix() class, whereas students could probably get a little extra Python learning in if the assignments used numpy. Also, with the exception of the Runaway Robot Project #5, the class is almost a little too easy. I hate to use that word because the concepts are pretty advanced, but the assignments are more or less spoon fed to some degree. Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\n\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it. The final project is worth a whopping 40% of the class grade and is very open ended with minimal opportunity for extra credit (3 teams total). To me it seems that the final is worth a little too much and the weekly assignments are not worth quite as much as they should be. I ended up with a grade that I am very happy with, but it came a little too close for comfort ;) Perhaps I was too busy enjoying the class? Very applied class. Quizzes do tend to escalate from basic and straighforward (almost to the 'why is this a quiz') to light speed very quickly. Programming assignments are very straightforward, and Runaway Robot project is not that difficult if you've kept pace with the lectures. The final project was quite interesting, very real-world stuff. TA are very helpful with assistance.  I liked this very challenging class a lot, although there difficulties as well. I am a programmer, but have no statistics nor linear algebra experience. I wasn't sure I was ready, given the complexity, but I jumped in. I felt like the assignments were incredibly fun and challenging, however, I didn't feel like the instructional videos offered more than a cursory understanding at times, and the book was cryptic if you didn't already understand the material. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a real challenge and is looking to understand a broad overview of many different aspects of AI. The best instruction came from the guest lecturer Sebastian Thrun.  Make sure you know your linear algebra, especially matrix multiplication and other operations. Also make sure you are familiar with Python. Maybe then you might have a chance at getting at least a \"C\". Unless you have some prior knowledge in this field (AI), can you do well; what is taught in the class is not sufficient to get you an \"A.\"  The only really challenging part of this course is the final project, which is worth 40% of your grade. But if you dont get to the final project with a 100% or higher, then you have done something wrong (unless they change the grading in the course :P ). Having said that, the material is extremely interesting and very very well run. Dr. Thrun is an exceptional professor and is very interactive with tutorials, and the TAs do a great job. This is definitely the best course I have taken ever in anything, just don't expect it to be the most challenging course you will take. Thus, it is great to take with another course that has a higher workload! If the entire course was on Udacity for no credit, I would give it five stars. The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun's relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn't seem like as much of a road block. \n\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun's lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable. \n\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer. By the time the projects start (if you don't front-load) you feel like you are constantly playing catch-up. This only adds to the stress you feel because the projects don't really line up with any of the lectures.  Interesting but not particularly challenging class. The projects are challenging if you try to implement the concepts described in class, but can be solved geometrically otherwise. If you take this, I recommend getting the optional textbook and doing all the research and hardware challenges to extend the content. The lectures and projects alone are not particularly substantial. This course is very hard just because of project-3. For weeks, majority of student's hardwork produced zero credit. Finally, TAs extended the deadline by a week and gave us some breathing space. We were able to manage some partial credit on the last project and a lot of students fell back in their grades. The course is really interesting and has lots of stuff to learn and enjoy. But the projects demand heavy efforts, time and energy. There is not much of guidance from TAs and usually limited to high level ideas only. It will boil down to keep trying to find the best algorithm around the ideas to pass the testcases.  This is a really interesting class and I highly reccomend it. However, it's easy to give it short shrift and not take the time to get the most out of it (ie reading wikipedia, Thrun's BOOK , watching youtube videos on the topics -- none of these things are required or necessary, but make the class better). The lectures are structured to take full advantage of the Udactity integrated python enviroment. This makes it easy to make incremental advances in your understanding of the topics. I wish they covered a few more ways to apply the different types of filters. Each filter is explained in a particular context and without experience in the field it's difficult to see how it could be applied in another situation. Regarding, the projects, the first is pretty applicable and well designed. The second project seems to have little to do with the course material and you end up integrating something just for the sake of the project's requirements.   Well designed syllabus to engage the student using practical examples as motivation, hiding away most of the math in the process. On the other hand, more materials could have been taught and so it requires your own initiatives to go further. It's a little wasteful to treat this as a full semester's module. Given Sebastian's schedules, expect his involvements to be very minimal. It takes a very helpful and knowledgeble TA and an engaging piazza community to get the course going. Design of the final project wasn't very well considered, as you couldn't really apply the knowledge. One classmate proposed his own idea, which I thought was way cooler. go google github for py-fire or something, Would be super awesome if the community can take his project, develop further into future assignment for the course.  Interesting topics, but feels like it should be an undergraduate class. Final project was not particularly engaging.  The topics were interesting and it was cool to see the application of them. The final project was a little strange- didn't seem to have much to do with the rest of the course.  The videos are enjoyable and encouraging with a *little* exaggeration like \"you've just wrote the code for self-driving car!\" The script to process quiz answers in the videos does not produce consistent result. It's quite frustrating to discover that you need to copy and paste your code into \"certain area\" otherwise it doesn't work. Furthermore, for the first project I got great results in my testing environment using the class testing script, but ended up missing 50% of the credit because it didn't produce same results in the graders? Drop this class in the end. I had previously taken the class when it was offered on Udacity as a MOOC before it became a \"for-credit\" class at GT. It's exactly the same. I had been hoping that it was 'beefed up' a bit for a graduate program but it's not. \n\nThe best part of this class is that Sebastian is a great teacher and enthusiastic about his work. While he doesn't participate much in the forums, he does conduct live office hours (or at least he did the semester I was taking it. ) This is where you can 'go deeper' on the material and learn from the master. This is really the best reason to take the class if you're interested in robotics. Sebastian is a 'god-amongst-men' in the world of robotics and you're unlikely to ever get so much valuable face time with somebody of his caliber as easily. \n\nThe projects are pretty easy. (KBAI and Computer Vision have way harder problems sets) The TAs were responsive and held regular office hours using Google Chat which allowed students to view them after the fact. (This skill set seems to allude TAs in other classes, so kudos to the AI for Robotic TAs for figuring this out. )\n\nThere is an allowance to let the students either propose their own projects or work on the 'assigned' final project. Due to an illness, I had to work on the assigned final project, which is what most of the class did anyway. Frankly this assigned final project is pretty much a waste of time and a 'fool's errand. ' While you apply what you've learned, very little of it makes much difference to the end results. Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the 'high side' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class. \n\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project. This will allow you to pick a problem that is directly related to robotics rather than the contrived one that seemed pretty pointless. If I had it to do over again, this is where I'd make my change.  I did not enjoy this class because the lectures feel very disconnected from what you are asked to complete for the projects. People were going way beyond the course content to research other methods in order to complete all of the projects and some major parts of the lectures are completely ignored. \n\nThat being said, I feel it is still easy to get a good grade without really understanding the subject at all. However, one of the pieces of project 2 ended up being extra credit because it was a nightmare to complete in the summer. The course has 6 problem sets and 3 projects. The first two projects are related to the content in the course and require a certain level of mastery of that content to complete them successfully. The last project requires students to go way above and beyond to do well. Techniques learned in the 6 lessons were not applicable to our solution for the final project. \n\nAll the work is solo until the final project, which can be done in groups. \n\nThe TAs are pretty helpful in Piazza and office hours and there are several chances to ask questions directly to Professor Thrun. I took this course under the impression it would be a \"good fit\" for a summer course. You could front-load, which is useful when you have vacations going on during the summer. \n\nThe lectures are deceptive. A lot of times in the quizzes, Dr. Thrun says, \"It's ok if you can't figure this out, just view the answer, \" which means you can coast through the Udacity lessons. What he really needs to say is, \"If you don't understand the math for this, run away, far, far, away. \" Because, when it comes time for the projects, you will need to implement some of these algebra or calculus functions on your own. My math skills are weak (and I'm working on bringing them up with outside coursework because math is the foundation for all that we do) and my mathematical programming skills (especially for Python) weaker. \n\nI understand that from my personal perspective, I was not \"ready\" for this course. And the shortened schedule of summer semester means if you aren't ready, you are either expecting a moment of genius, or are going to drop the course. You can guess which one I chose. Others with a deeper background and familiarity with the basic concepts presented in the course, and an understanding of the logical processes required, will do just fine. If you are one of those people, fantastic! I hope to be at your level someday soon. Interesting lectures. Like other reviewers I feel they don't go deep enough but I think Udacity lectures can/will only go so deep in general anyway. The optional textbook helps with that for this course. \n\nRequired for the summer were problem sets on Udacity (30%), project 1 (20%), project 2 (20%), final project (30%). There were numerous extra credit opportunities, both actual EC and pseudo EC that would push you to a higher grade if you were on the boundary. \n\nUdacity has all the answers for the problem sets and it was expected that we would use them before submitting. That's 30% of our grade just given to us. \n\nProject 1 was the runaway robot project on Udacity. Although it appears at the end of the Udacity course, only the first 3 lessons were relevant. Part 5 of the project ended up being extra credit. The first 4 parts are doable with basic math and probability, but the point is to use what was learned in those first 3 lessons. \n\nProject 2 involved helping a robot find its way around a warehouse. Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn't use those test cases only has themselves to blame. Part C had so many kinks it ended up becoming EC. Part B was regraded when it was discovered some test cases didn't match the project specs. \n\nFinal project, hexbug location prediction, sounds irrelevant to the material covered in class. It's not. It's certainly doable with irrelevant items but many successful projects used techniques (or extensions) from class. Using extensions of techniques learned in class is reasonable for a grad-level course in a top-tier school. \n\nTAs were great and helpful. Pryby as well, more so than others here suggest. I did not enjoy this class. Lectures explain trivial stuff in length, but skim over complicated stuff. The instructor's style of teaching and code made an impression on me as being sloppy, not paying attention to details. Projects did not require to use learned techniques. \nReading other people comments I expected this class to be fun and relatively easy. This is my first C, while my all 3 previous classes were A. I spent at least an hour a day every day on that class, but did not succeed. Maybe it is just due to my lack of interest to the subject of robotics.  Since this course is strictly driven from Udacity including assignments, this course might seem a bit mechanical. But the group assignment in the end was fun. Gives an insight into the world of self driving car. Overall an engaging course. If you are interested in self-driving car technology, and who isn't, you want to take this course.  This was *the* perfect course.  It had a world renown professor, the head of google's self driving cars, who knows his stuff, explains complex topics in intuitive ways, is enthusiastic and has a sense of humor.  The TAs are great, on top of every thread.  And if you're into this sort of thing, it is E.A.S.Y.  The answers are given!   You can literally just cut and paste code from the answers page and put it in.  The TAs are ok with this.  The lectures are short, and there is no complex mathematics anywhere that you find in many other OMSCS courses (it's all simple trigonometry).  This is the best course ever, and the *perfect* introduction to OMSCS.  If you are just starting your masters, you want this course.\n\nMy only complaint is it was too easy.  Now, a lot of other reviews say it was hard, so hard they dropped out, and there was too much math.  Let me address this.  First, If they think there was too much math here, or it was hard, they obviously haven't taken a truly hard class, like Machine Learning, Graduate Algorithms, AI, Computer Vision, etc etc.  If they found this hard, I don't see how they would be able to graduate.  There is NO math required to get an A (again, you can just cut-and-paste answers).  \n\nThe reason people think it is hard is because they shoot themselves in the foot.  They did not ask 'is there an easier way to do this?'.  They did not read the requirements carefully, or assumed too much.  For example, for the projects, you are asked to predict the next location of a robot.  The lectures are about Kalman filters, and so many people naturally assumed you should be using a Kalman Filter.  But see, that is not anywhere in the assignment.  Why even bother, when it's such a simple solution? The robot is moving a fixed distance at a fixed angle.  SImple trigonometry will give you the answer.  The next assignment, the measurements are noisy, and these people again, for whatever reason, shoot themselves in the foot and try to use a Kalman filter.  It's non-linear noisy movement, so they try to implement the Extended Kalman Filter.  Again, there is no need to do that!  The EKF isn't even mentioned!  There were posts after posts on the Extended Kalman Filter, pages and pages devoted to the topic, for absolutely no reason.   Why do unneccessary work like 'calculating the determinate of the Jacobian Matrix'?  I have no idea.\nThe only assignments you're not given the answers to are the 3 projects.  There are people reporting 100+ hours on the third project alone.  I handed it in within 3 days, and got a 100%.  These people are trying to do it the hard way, like calculate probabilities for distant objects, trying to implement difficult algorithms like graph slam, all for no reason.  Sure, all those things were suggested in the descriptions, and that's what the lectures are about, so kudos to you if you wanted to go that route.  But, and I can't emphasize this enough, there is no need for any of that.  There's no move limit, you can ram into as many walls as you like - that means you can design the most inefficent algorithm you want.  You can randomly carom your robot about the screen and, while slow and ugly, will eventually traverse the entire warehouse.  I can mathematically prove it if you want.\nPoint is, if you're willing to solve problems in your own way, and not the complicated way, you'll do just fine in this class.  I didn't even know python when starting this course and my final grade is 99.5%\n\n The professor constructed this course to be fun. The assignments are mostly utilization of a robotic simulator, plenty of freedom to roam. A lot of practical statistics in this course; most of the programming assignments (all done in python) will require the implementation of a probability matrix and deterministic actions based thereon. The entire course is in Udacity; if you get a green checkmark on all Udacity entries, then you will get a 100% in this course. The final couple programming assignments are complex and will require many many hours of time (if you really want that A).  This is the first course of Gatech. I have CS background and quite familiar with python.\nAs I look at some previous review of this course, quite a few people consider it as \"bird\" course. However, from my experience, this is NOT a bird course. \nLectures are very good and straightforward, you will be given problem set to solve after every series of lectures, but all problem sets are straightforward.\nHowever, all projects are NOT easy. I did a little bit trick on couple projects to get 100%. But in the last project, I spent more than 15 hours for 3 weeks, I still couldn't completely solve it. \nAgain, python for this course is easy, but math is difficult, make sure understand the math before any implementation.  Enjoyed Dr. Thrun's lectures & office hours. The course instructor & TAs tried their best to help the class with projects & assignments. We had regular office hours which were very helpful in keeping the momentum. \nAll the 3 projects were fun but could have been better especially the feedback mechanism. Having completed CV in spring which seems to have the most well thought of & organized assignments, this did look a little messed up. They should have taken advantage of Bonnie for creating a more interactive response mechanism to assignment submissions. \nOverall learnt quiet a bit on the subject which in itself is such a vast feild & cannot be expected to be mastered with just 1 graduate level course... Great course: great instructor, great TAs, great content and exciting assignments. My only minor concern was that I found the material a bit too short (you have lectures only every second week). Be sure to start to work on the final assignment early because it is harder than the rest of the course, I found myself running out of time while I still wasn't 100% finished with it. Also, brush up your python a bit to make things easier. The class is quite easy and a great companion course for Computer Vision or Computational Photography class if you can manage 2 classes a semester (I had a bit of prior knowledge in AI, computer vision and control theory, I found half of the course already familiar). ", 
    "CS-8803-004": " very interesting topics. I took the first offering of this class online and as a result some of the assignments/projects were vague in their requirements, but the professor and TAs were very helpful. The project and homework workloads have been pretty much alike. In both cases, the assignment descriptions have been vague and piazza has been a great help. \nThe video material is nice and concise. \nWe haven't had an exam as of March 17th 2016. \nThe first project was insanely ambitious and the next one sounds exciting. \nOverall I think it's been okay for a first run of the course. I'm having a good time. \n\n[Edit, May 11 2016]\nThe final exam showed great improvement from the project and assignments before it. It was, in fact a very well produced exam, which evaluated the student's knowledge and insight, rather than plain memory. \n\nOverall, I still think it was a good first run with an inevitable learning curve from the staff side. Next offering will no doubt be much better. \n\nAgain: A lot of compiler plumbing is present in this course... and not one ARM Cortex processor.  First and foremost, with respect to computing, this class is the low level. You must have a solid understanding of theoretical computing architecture. (i. e. von neumann, registers , clocks , etc) ALso, if you're also comfortable with C / C++ stl , this should be a breeze (as of mar27). If you want to get a headstart on the class, purchase the book and get comfortable with the VEX toolchain. You'll be required to work on ubuntu on top of vagrant on top of GATech's deep thought cluster. You can create your own local env to work on but it probably isnt a good idea.  This course is NOT an introduction to embedded software, it is a graduate level course in Embedded Computing with sole focus on pipe lined architectures like VLIW. Most of the assignments are related to compiler optimization and scheduling. The video course material is riddled with errors and inconsistencies, explanations of topics are pretty weak and assignments come in verbose long paragraphs of text walls which also have some errors in them. So to do any assignments the best thing is to wait it out on Piazza and have all the questions answered before you begin to solve one. The best way i found to go about this course is to ONLY read the text book and do one of the many other compiler lectures (from CMU online) to understand the text. They should really throw away all the material they have created and make a new one. Honestly, this is one course you can absolutely do without (or you can audit in your spare time if you wish) not because of the course content but the haphazard way of delivering content mired with errors. \n\nThe grading is lenient so at least that is a positive and once you cut through the clutter, the course material is moderate difficulty.  The course name clearly doesn't do much justice to the content. It's got nothing to do with embedded software/programming. \nClose to 1/3rd of the course is dedicated to ILP, VLIW etc which are more an computer architecture topic. CS6290 will provides a more solid foundation in this area (although not specific to VLIW based processors). \nThe next part deals with different aspects of compiler optimizations for VLIW based processors which was clearly more interesting. The lecture videos give a decent introduction to the topic & rest of the details had to be uncovered in the research papers on the topics. \nThe assignments were mostly appropriate to the topics covered in lectures. The TAs as well as Prof. were always active on piazza to that was helpful. They regularly had office hours so there was never a dull moment during the course. \nOverall I would recommend the course if you are interested in very low level working of embedded architectures & compiler optimization for embedded processors.  I liked the subject matter which is why I took the course. I found some of the material quite interesting and some just okay but that is all personal interest based rather than anything wrong with the material. The good news is that the professor does a good job explaining things, material is interesting, and grading was generous based on understanding concepts rather than rote memorization. The bad news is that one of the TA's did not do a good job of interacting with students on Piazza: some questions were ignored, some were marked as answered but still ignored, some were answered with short unhelpful responses (even condescending ones), and maybe 25% got useful answers. There were also a couple issues with mistakes on assignment and project requirements (incorrect assumptions and documentation, missing or incorrect files, etc. ) that didn't get addressed until just before the due dates. If you work hard in this class you will do a lot better than you might feel like you are doing due to the frustrations with trying to get questions answered and clarify buggy requirements. If you are interested in optimizations for compilers for embedded architectures this is quite an interesting course. You just need to be able to overlook the frustrating lack of Piazza support. Reviewing near the end of the course. Great course that focuses on how classic CS concepts like graph theory can be practically applied by tailoring software for embedded systems. \n\nThis class isn't a hardware course, nor is it a course on how to write software for an embedded system. It's a class on how software is manipulated to run efficiently on power, hardware, and size limited devices. \n\nIt covers:\nembedded system instruction set architectures\nhardware support \ninstruction level parallelism\npipelining\nand compiler optimizations that take regular code and compile it such that it can run on embedded systems. \n\nThe course was condensed for summer but I think we still covered the same material. We had 4 homework assignments (initially 5), each taking about 5-15 hours to complete over 2 weeks. There was one project, taking about 20-25 hours to complete over a moth. There were also homework assignments due during this time. I think the full semester may have two projects, and two more homeworks that were smaller. \n\nThere was a proctored midterm and will be a proctored final, the midterm took an hour to complete (you get two hours). The level of difficulty was on par with the homework, but the test is closed notes. \n\nIn the condensed semester there were 2 lectures series and a reading per week for the first half, dropping to one of each after the midterm. The hardest thing to keep up with is covering the material in order to do the homeworks and take the tests, I recommend watching at 1. 25 speed due to reduce time spent. \n\nThe project and one homework were C++ programs. You can do this in your own environment, but you will run some code on GT's deepthought cluster via SSH. There's no GUI, but all you need are basic Linux commands. The assignments were straightforward implementations of concepts from the lectures/readings. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this course. If you are taking CCA, this course will apply some of the Graph theory concepts covered there.  Course discusses optimizations done by compilers for embedded processors such as ARM. \n- Part 1: Architecture: weakest part teaching-wise. I think HPCA would be better here.\n- Part 2: Compilers: very clear and interesting.\n- Part 3: Compiler Optimizations: each lecture dicusses an optimization idea/paper for compilers. Very clear and very interesting.\n\n- Projects: 1 coding project (teams of 2) and 1 profiling/compilation project (individual-based). The first project was very nice and challenging. All in C++. You need to buy a raspberrypi for the second project.\n- HWs: 4-5 total. Take time to complete, pen and paper based. Couple of them needed writing small code snippets. Not hard HWs, but not easy either. Just the right level.\n- Final was medium difficulty.\n- The main problem (a big one) with this course was the TAing. Hope it\u2019s fixed now.\n 1. The name of the course is a bit misleading.  The course deals more with compiler optimizations for embedded systems than programming for embedded.\n2. Even so, the lectures were well done and the required reading adds to the course.  You'll learn a good amount.\n3. The concepts are not overly difficult. or time consuming. The TAs for this semester were not stellar - this was the only real negative about the class.\n\n4 homework assignments - require about 5-10 hours each applying lessons/reading - fairly easy\n2 projects (1 with a partner) - requires about 40 hours total work each - fairly easy if you put in the time\n1 comprehensive (proctored) final exam - takes the full 3 hours, only hard because the questions are not well formed and the required syntax is not suited for an online exam\n\n\nOverall, I liked it, and I could recommend it if you ever plan to work with embedded systems (the under the hood knowledge is valuable). Very good course but not a entry level for a student like me that just start to learn computer science. I agree with most of what has been said about the Summer semester. This is a \"1. 0\" or \"1. 1\" version of the class however. The professor and TA's were very active and helpful in Piazza. The only frustrating part for me was the homework being so vaguely or inconsistently worded, so the advice of waiting a day or two and reading Piazza very closely I would also second. The grading was fair however, and the homework did become more clear after clarifications via Piazza, so in the scheme of things this isn't the end of the world. I would still very much recommend this class if you want to learn more about pipelines, VLIW, etc. ", 
    "CS-8803-008": " This was a fantastic course. The lectures, HW, projects were self sustaining and HARD, but you will walk away a much better programmer and have had an opportunity to really apply topics related to computer science. I loved the course topic and organization so much, that I may take it again in Spring or Fall at some point in future. \n\nThe projects require a SOLID understanding of C++ or Java, and if you are not an super start programmer with strong data structure and algorithm skills you will need a VERY STRONG partner. This class is not watered down at all, and partially what made the class so great. If this course is a reflection of the Professors other courses, I plan to take all of them. Background: I'm a software engineer working in parallel algorithm implementation using C++, married with no kids, and this is my 9th class in the program. \n\nThere is a project consisting of writing a compiler for the language Tiger. You're provided with a scanner that gives you a tagged token stream and you have to write a top-down, table-driven parser, modify the grammar to make it LL(1) or as close as you can get, and produce four-address code that assumes unlimited registers as an intermediate representation. In the second phase, you perform register allocation and instruction selection and generate MIPS instructions. Although you learn code optimization, the grading emphasis is on correctness, not performance. \n\nThe project is coding-intensive. You can use either Java or C++ and are provided with a few default data structures that you may or may not use. Most of what you need you have to develop yourself. As it is a table-driven parser, your best bet is to write a code-generator that parses your grammar spec and creates the table, which is what something like yacc or ANTLR does, but you're not allowed to use those and have to write your own parser generator. \n\nThere is also a written homework every few weeks, similar to CCA in that you need to answer some think-cases, but much easier in that you\u2019re just working through existing algorithms, not devising your own and proving they work. There is also a comprehensive final. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s a first run, the course feels like a finished product. It is very well-run with clear requirements and the material is fantastic. Be prepared to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to get a working product unless you\u2019ve done this before, but it is well worth it and extremely satisfying to see your baby in the wild. You\u2019ll leave with the know-how to create your own basic programming language. As said by many, this class is quite hard but interesting if you really want to know the internals of how the code that you write gets transformed internally.  4 Homeworks (30%),  1 Project (group of 2 - 3 members) 35% , 1 Final exam (35%) which is quite good as if we have midterm exams, this course can't be complete in the 3-4 months time.\n Try to choose the team member of the project who is good at C++ / Java, may be 2+ years experienced, as that will save a lot of time in coding for the project.\nPoints which I hated about the class are\n1. the lack of response by Professor in Piazza. Its only weekly once during the office hours he answers the questions\n2. Coordination miss between the head TA and another TA (this TA was scarcastic & harsh in the response).  There were only 2 TAs as the size of the class is < 50.\n3. When you post private questions on piazza on how to proceed for a question in homework, the TA hardly cares and makes it public and waits for other student's response which you hardly get. So it remains unanswered till the due date of the homework. \n4. The homeworks don't cover all the pieces that you read. Few of the concepts won't be tested and the last homework was a copy from the lecture slides\nThings l loved \n1. The textbook prescribed. Sometimes you get that AHA-AA feeling.\n2. The project.  It helps you understand the subject well as you will be designing a compiler from scratch for a programming language.\n3. The course contents and the lecture videos.   I took the course with some experience of java and some knowledge of algorithms and data structures(including graphs). This course is excellent, provided one is ready to spend at least 15-20 hours per week, attending video lectures, reading books and doing projects/assignments. This course will teach you how a program like Java or C gets compiled though different phases, and finally gets converted to machine level code. Be ready to be challenged on programming projects as you will need to use data structures extensively, when implementing different phases of compilers. Lecture videos are excellent and reading books, though encouraged by Prof Pandey, may not be needed in some cases. Overall, an excellent learning experience and highly recommended. If you take this course without having taken the undergraduate equivalent, you will be in for a wild ride (i.e. what are you doing here, walk away slowly). Per other descriptions, you will be implementing an entire compiler! \n\nPros:\n\n1. The lectures are very good and don't cover useless material like other courses (cough, cough, CV). \n2. The projects are useful. You will get an actual compiler at the end of the day.\n3. There's no hand holding while creating the compiler - you will build everything from the ground up.\n4. The TAs (now gradudated) responded almost instantly on Slack and Piazza.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The HW is graded far too rigorously.\n2. The actual project is haphazardly graded (i.e. they're not using a rubric so you will get a somewhat random grade).\n3. The project specification is so vague that you will be constantly asking for clarification on Piazza. This was nerve wrecking and frustrating. The lack of professionalisim on behalf of the TAs made this worse. This is an incredibly difficult class with a very large time commitment. The lectures are dense but helpful for the most part. These lectures gloss over some details which force you to read the book which has moments of utility but is by and large, a jargon-riddled dumpster fire. The book uses some dreamed up syntax to express some of the algorithms which is pretty taxing to understand. The best approach is just to re-write the algorithm in code into you get the results you expect. The homework is very difficult because the questions are vague but expect precise answers. Fortunately, if you head my advice for dealing with the text book, you can use the same approach and produce code to solve your homework. You don't get credit for the code but it certainly make producing nice LaText and reduces the chance of you transliterating something in your process. If you can explain your approach, you might be able to retain some points but overall, the homework grading is very strict. The coding portion of the project is massive. Absolutely massive. I think it should have been split into at least 3 projects but that may have slowed the class down and there is a lot of ground to cover. I have no complaints about the project grading or what they asked of us. The project document is pretty vague and you have to interpret and justify a lot of your design decisions, just like in real life :)\n\nThe final was not fun and was pretty much like the homework. Treat the homeworks like a practice exam in order to get a feel for the final. The final grading has a decent curve so don't give up, always submit at least something. The way the assignments are weighted, you can't afford to skip any single task. Excellent course: content, organization, staff, and programming assignments. \nVery interesting to learn how code is compiled, and how compilers optimize the code internally to make it more efficient. The course covers all compilers phases. Lectures are crystal clear. Professor has been very committed to the office hours (weekly), open to different types of question. TA is very prompt, rarely let a day pass with unresolved piazza questions, with clear concise answers. \n\nProgramming projects! Not for the faint of heart. Implemented either in C++ or Java. No starter code. As I understand, the summer version of the projects is a bit different than Fall/Spring which included more compiler phases but with starter code. Be very well prepared with one of those 2 languages. And explore data structures, you'll need to use lots of sets, vectors, stacks,... etc as well as structs. Projects can be done solo or in teams of 2, but we were strongly advised to work in teams. And having taken the solo option and spent tons of time to keep up with this choice, I recommend you find a team mate unless you're an experienced programmer. \n\nThere are 2 projects, the first is a front-end project where you implement a simple scanner, and implement a parser generator and an LL(1) parser. The second project was much harder, where you implement 3 methods of register allocation on IR code and convert the code into assembly, and simulate the assembly using SPIM simulator. \n\nThere were 4 HWs, that take a bit of time, pen and paper work, but they were excellent in measuring how well you undrstand the material. \n\nThere's a final exam, haven't taken it yet, but it should cover the entire syllabus. \n\nAs I remember Projects: 35%, HW; 35%, final exam: 30%\n\nPerhaps the only con would be the absence of an auto grader, and being given basic tests to try our code against, you will have to devise your own tests, otherwise risk failures with the grading tests. \n\nHighly recommended. The first pre-requisite of this course is patience. Lectures are long and intense and the project is also very long, but you get to learn. Homeworks require pen and paper work but are interesting and not as hard as project. Final is said to be consisting of some MCQs and some essay type questions, but what we got are 3 MCQs (worth about 10%) and rest problems. Final is similar to homework problems.  \n\nThere are a few logistic issues like you dont have a practice exam or you dont know the cutoffs for grades, but overall it was a decent course. Grading is not that strict, but cutoffs are high (not as high as absolute grading). \nBeing patient and not giving up will be rewarded in this course.   I took this during the Summer semester, so it was accelerated compared to a normal-length semester. \n\nThe lectures were good, for the most part. One frustrating series of lectures was on live ranges and webs. Resources around the internet on these topics sometimes consider them equal, and sometimes don't. This part of the lectures seemed to gloss over how they're actually built, which was problematic, since one of the projects was centered around them. \n\nSpeaking of projects, they were useful, and it was cool to implement some of the algorithms/processes used in the various compiler phases. Grading seemed to be very generous; I got full marks on both projects. I'm not sure how they were graded or how many different types of inputs were thrown at them. There was a partner option for the projects, which I reluctantly took advantage of for the second project. Just a heads up in case you're anti-group project like me. \n\nThe exam was tough but fair. I was able to score well after studying the most important algorithms from the class. The good:  \nThis was the most practical of all the courses I have taken.  You use modern compiler tools, assembly code, optimization techniques that can work for any program, and the stuff about parsing is almost exciting.  Ever write a program that got too big to manage?  Parsing and Intermediate Representations is the answer.\n\nThe bad:\nThe course is run entirely by the TAs.  The instructor does not participate.  You may get lucky, but my TAs were horrible.  They may be very nice people but they cannot teach.  Their English is not the greatest, and the questions they ask are vague and ambiguous.  Without exaggeration, every assignment and project was riddled with typos or mistakes.  And not little ones.  We're talking missing verbs, references to variables that don't exist, output examples being wrong, unstated requirements, or just bad English.  \n\nIf I were to give examples I'd be here all day.  A very simple example is being asked to re-write some code.  I added two lines.  It fulfilled the requirements, and it worked.  I got 0 credit, with the explanation 'Instructions say to rewrite'.  Submitting a regrade request led to more points being taken off a different question.\n\nThese TAs seem incapable of understanding ambiguity.  Depending on how you ask for clarification, you will get conflicting answers.  I tried reducing all piazza posts to yes/no questions, and even then they answered 'yes' to 'can I use string concatenation' and then marked points off for using string concatenation.  Stuff like that, all the time.  If you don't give the exact answer they expect, regardless of whether you met all the requirements or not, you fail.  They are very strict and do not appear to read your explanations.  I think they suffer from TL,DR syndrome.  Considering most of the questions are about invented, imaginary grammar, it's impossible to prove your point to them.\n\nSame thing for projects, with the added complication of partners who went through the same confusion, asked the same questions, and got different answers because they asked a different way.  The lectures are about generic parsers, and are unrelated to any actual work, which made things worse.  Try convincing your teammates that both the TA and the lectures are wrong.  Not gonna happen.  So you stop pushing commits to Git, because they keep changing your code, you end up doing all the work yourself, are accused of not being a team player, and then as time runs out they end up using your code in the end because you knew what you were talking about.  This actually happened to me.\n\nIf you don't care about your grade, and can handle nonsensical feedback/scores, you will learn some practical stuff.  Otherwise this course will make you question your sanity. PROS:\n1. If you are interested in this material, it is a good class in terms of what is being taught. You will build a compiler from the ground up.\n2. The grading was generous.\n\nCONS:\n1. You better learn about registers and memory on your own because it is NOT covered in the least. A lot of times is spent on parsing, regex, languages, etc. and zero time is spent on the technical part of a compiler.\n2. As another reviewer said, the course is run mostly by the TAs. When I took it, there was one very vocal TA in that they were active on Piazza and Slack, but their answers were TERRIBLE. When I realized this, I tried phrasing my questions as yes\\no or as multiple choice, to try and steer them towards actually answering them, but never did they just give me an answer! \n3. The professor participated in office hours, but had no idea what the current homework was. He would be asked a question and would have to look at the homework as if it was the first time he's ever seen it. The homework had plenty of typos and ambiguities.\n4. All the answers, from the professor and the TAs were always so laconic. This is an online class based mostly on text. This is a place to answer in full sentence and elaborate, or else what is the function of having a class vs. just having lectures?\n5. The lectures are very general, so not very helpful for the homework and the project.\n\nThis class makes all other classes I've taken before and after seem like a dream.", 
    "CS-8803-009": " Took OMS CS-8803-009 in fall.   It tests lot of skills, MatLab, C, Calculus, differential equations.   The material is so interesting, as it focuses on autonomous cars and airplanes.   I had a great group of 3, two of my group members took the on-campus section.    Secondly it had a good professors, it was joint between Eric Feron and Hughes.    Lastly the TA was great in office hours.    The office hours were held on Saturday am which made them easy to attend.     I learned a lot in the class as I have a fascination with autonomous system.   But like everything you get out what you're willing to put in.       Also it by far the most different course from any I've taken in the program. \n I echo a lot of what the other reviews from this semester say - 1st half easy and pretty enjoyable, 2nd half frustrating and generally a waste of time. You can be successful in this class if you are an effective bullshitter, and can respond to vague questions with equally vague responses that are technically correct. Any PID experience will make things go faster but other than that common sense can get you through most of it. Just DO NOT take this course unless you do real-time embedded systems for a living. The first half of the course was ok. Once the second half started and Professor Jerome Hugues appeared, the misery started.  He does not teach you anything and seems cocky and arrogant. The assignments he gives have no explanations behind them anywhere and are based on the material so arcane and esoteric, that probably only 0.001% of the IT world uses. The responses he gives on Piazza are so confusing - you wish you never asked the questions in the first place. Just spare yourself and stay away from this course. Overall a very good class for general computer science program.\nPrerequisites: Python (basic), C (basic), controls theory (undergraduate level). \n\nI definitely recommend taking the course, especially as one of the earlier courses in your plan of study. The reason being that the content, assignments and projects introduces a lot of different fields - network sockets, controls (primarily open vs closed loop with single and multi-variable feedback), system modeling, embedded programming and architecture design & analysis among other CPS topics. The course can be coupled with SDP course and I think the two together shall provide a strong fundamental mechanisms required for other OMSCS courses. \n\nI found the Udacity lectures to be very good but with lot of information. It is a good thing! I took lot of hand-written notes as I went through the lectures and that was helpful to enforce the concepts/theory/case studies. The assignments were primarily hands-on, i.e. programming in C or Python. Starter codes were provided for all assignments/projects and the tasks themselves don't require a lot of programming but it requires understanding of how the starter code works. Understanding involves ability to read the provided code and also run experiments with the code. This might require exploring some external resources especially in C or Python in case you have minimal experience. The instructors are very helpful and held a weekly Q&A session (Saturday), though not many students participated to take advantage of the instructors availability. Beyond that any additional information required for the tasks has to be researched just like in any graduate course.\n\nThe course towards the end introduces AADL (a model based language) for a project but the time frame to learn AADL was short and coupled with the project deliverable which made the project more challenging. But challenges are fun, right? I found this to be one of the best part of the course. It would have been nice if at least the last two projects were based on AADL as that would give ample time to learn the language and related simulation tool and also be able to focus on the required project tasks properly.\n\nIf you are interested to know about - systems at large, embedded systems, real-time systems and controls, robotics, quadcopters (lot of examples based on this) and architecture development, then take this course. It is a good introduction from both computer science and CPS perspective. After taking eight courses in OMSCS (all As), my biggest regret in this program is taking this course. Don't take it. And if you're signed up for it, then drop it. By the second half of the course a second professor, Jerome Hugues, comes in and is a highly ineffective teacher. \n\nHe doesn't care to teach and rather just gives an overwhelming assignment and wants you to ask question. But he's French so to American students he comes off as a rude ass when you do ask questions. His answers are very indirect because he doesn't want to spoil the process of a student figuring it out for themselves... the end result being that the student never figures it out. \n\nThere are no prereqs to this course but if you don't come from an engineering background then you will be at a disadvantage during the first half and then completely lost in the second.  This class was bad and got tremendously worse after the withdrawal date.  The lectures aren't relevant to the assignments, the assignments aren't complete enough to complete without attending office hours.  In addition, the professor frequently either blows off or is more than 15 mins late to office hours, and then he can't operate webex.  And that's the first half of the class before you get to the second professor who will remind you he's just an adjunct as an excuse for delayed responses when you have questions about the vague assignments with VMs that don't actually work so you lose 3 days on an assignment waiting for him to say how to fix his VM.  Nevermind that 95% of the students are full time students with other responsibilities and some have other classes to schedule around as well.  I had 90% plus on every assignment in this class, and A's in 3 of my 5 previous classes, and I'm now attempting to get a C in this to not bomb my GPA, RUN the other direction. This course is effectively two, so must be reviewed in two parts:\n\n* Part one is taught by Dr. Eric Feron, who is a GT professor. This is the far better of the two course parts. The homework assignments and projects are well-defined and fairly straightforward, if divorced from the content of the lecture videos.\n\n I honestly did not even watch the course videos for the most part, and found them tangential at best to the tasks you're asked to complete. The actual videos are produced well enough but lack any kind of context or narrative thread, so it's very easy to just let it go in one ear and out the other without retaining anything. The Udacity course also commits an imho cardinal sin by embedding multiple videos on a single lesson section and consequently disabling auto-play (which goes back to the aforementioned lack of narrative thread). Ultimately though, as I noted before, this isn't a huge deal because the lecture videos aren't particularly useful -- in fact, the few instances when I did try to reference them to clarify something in an assignment I couldn't find anything pertinent.\n \n The homework assignments varied quite a bit, starting with basically some short Q&A/essays on cyber-physical systems, then going into basically a homework assignment solving a physics 101 problem (calc-based physics 101, to be clear), and then some minor coding assignments in C around black-box testing and input-output feedback loops. The essays required a day or so of work to compile, but neither the physics quiz nor the coding assignments required more than a couple hours work.\n\n Both projects involve commanding either one or a set of [GRITSbots](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/2014/11/the-gritsbot/) to accomplish a set of specified tasks, subject to a set of specified constraints, in a MATLAB [Robotarium](http://robotarium.gatech.edu/) simulator. You also have the opportunity to run your code against live robots in the Robotarium for the first project, which is neat but also frustrating, because you're only allotted two attempts in the actual live environment, and will likely find that your robot does not behave live as advertised in the simulation. This is not an issue for grading though, as you are provided a data set to use if needed for the analysis portion of this project, and are graded for code based on the results of the sim and not the live result.\n\n Both projects should be completable with a dedicated weekend of work.\n\n If the _entire_ course was just Dr. Feron's course, I would've probably rated this class \"Neutral\" with an \"Easy\" difficulty. I don't feel like I really _gained_ much from it, but the assignments were for the most part entertaining and it's elective hours.\n\n* Part two is taught by Dr. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Hugues, who is effectively \"on-loan\" from the Institute for Space and Aeronautics Engineering, part of the Universit\u00e9 F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Toulouse Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. He is highly credentialed and active in the CPS field. But don't for a second be fooled into thinking that implies he's effective as an instructor in this course.\n\n As Dr. Hugues is French, there is a language barrier to be overcome for the predominantly Anglophone demographic of the OMSCS program. His lessons and assignments are of course delivered in English -- you don't need to learn French, of course -- but his spoken English _is_ heavily accented and difficult to understand, and his written assignments often lack precision.\n\n Whereas the assignments for Dr. Feron's portion of the course were well-defined and had explicit questions and/or objectives, Dr. Hugues' assignments were exclusively _extraordinarily_ vague and open-ended questions, as though he's attempting a Socratic descent into teaching the material. That works _great_ in an open classroom setting where students and mentor can collaborate on exploring the topic. It is not at all appropriate for a graded assignment for which you're only allowed one submission.\n\n As another review noted -- and I don't know if this is just a cultural misunderstanding or actual personality -- Dr. Hugues can also be quite brusque when you attempt to ask for clarification. He often declines to answer questions outright, asserting that it's deliberately vague so that you can decide how best to answer (but how can I answer when I don't understand the query?).\n\n It could just be that I am not a smart individual, and certainly some students in the class were able to complete his assignments, but for both of them I found myself completely lost and in the mindset of \"I understand the individual words you've used, but I can't put them together into coherent entities that make sense in my brain.\" I've spent days trying to dissect his project and still don't understand what it is I'm intended to do. I suspect that, given Dr. Hugues' background, he just assumes a _lot_ of systems engineering background as common-sensible, which is probably a valid assumption at his home institution with his home target audience, but _isn't_ valid in a computer science course that has, at best, only an informal prerequisite of anything of the sort. I sure as hell don't, and I'm suffering mightily from it.\n\n It is worth noting that Dr. Hugues' portion of the course does not begin until _after_ the drop date, so Dr. Feron's portion can easily lull you into a sense of false security about where you stand grade-wise. With a _perfect_ score in the course going into drop day, I'm now basically assuming zero credit on all of Dr. Hugues' assignments and hoping I can perform well enough on the final (I think I can, since it is, I believe, prepared by Dr. Feron) to maintain a C.\n\n Consequently, for Dr. Hugues' portion of the course I would rate \"Strongly Disliked\" and \"Very Hard\" in terms of difficulty: I have learned nothing and gained nothing but frustration from it. I _do_ think that if you were able to surmount the language barrier, expand this to a full course on its own merit, and assume less in terms of prerequisite knowledge, this _could_ be an effective course. But absolutely not as it currently stands.\n\ntl; dr: Take this class at your peril. If you have an EE or systems engineering background you're probably going to be fine. If you don't, or have never worked on cyber-physical systems before, this is probably not an appropriate first course. (No, [6263](https://omscentral.com/courses/CS-6263) is not ample preparation.) This class is going to vary a LOT based on whether you have the mostly unmentioned prereqs.\nYou should have a strong math background.  It would be best if you have some sort of engineering background.  \nC, Matlab, AADL...\n\n\nThe material is interesting.  The lectures have almost no visuals and define very few of the in field concepts (mostly AE related).  It is difficult to find outside references if you do not get something.\nThe homework and projects seem like they would be easy *IF* you understand most of the concepts with little help.  If you are starting with ANY sort of deficit in background, they will be miserable.  So... high barrier to understanding what is asked, low-medium amount of actual work.  Almost all of my time was spent trying to look up concepts that weren't explained in Physics, Math, Matlap, AADL, etc.\nHomeworks, team projects, individual project + final exam.\n\n\nThis will be my lowest grade in the program with a 4.0 average otherwise, and most of the way through the program.  \n\nAppending a note after the final:  Final was fine compared to the rest of the course, but released quite late.  I really don't know how they'll adjust the schedule in following terms, but as we didn't even get to the final lecture, clearly they have some things to consider.  It has a lot of kinks to work out.  The prof seems enthusiastic, so I'd expect it to improve, but... expect to have to watch the lectures early, study, and need to pick up a lot of additional info.", 
    "CS-8803-GA": " It is a tough class, but is well worth the effort since you will learn concept that help you in almost every other course that's math heavy. I highly recommend taking this as your first or second course.\n\nAs noted by other reviewers, it takes Practice, Practice, Practice! Do all the homework and practice problems and additionally, the DPV textbook has a ton of practice problems and you can find more from other sources. Excellent course and great professor Eric Vigoda. The video lectures are of high quality and clearly explained by the professor. The course is heavily exam based - 85% of score comes from 4 exams (this might change in future semesters), one programming project (10%), and home works (5%). The course also required you to read the text book (DPV mainly) and do the practice problems. Overall, course is not too hard if you have some CS knowledge (data structures, recursion, graphs etc). The focus is heavily on understanding the algorithms and applying them in new problems rather than memorizing algorithms. So it is very important to do as much practice problems as you can. Overall, this is the most rewarding course in this program! This was a very difficult class, and it took me a lot of time to really master the materials. Listening to the weekly lectures and taking notes alone took me about 10 to 15 hours per week because I had to rewatch them several times to fully understand the topics. Doing the homework took about 5 hours or more per week. And, I spent about 20 hours or more per week to work on extra problems and reading. And so, on average, this class took me about 35 to 40 hours of studying per week. Can you do with much less amount of time? Absolutely! But it depends on a few factors. First, it depends on your goal: are you okay with a B (I'm not; I want my A)? I know some students who spent 10 to 15 hours a week, but were struggling to get into the B range or were solidly in the B range. Second, it depends on your background: are you familiar with the topics already (I'm not) or are you the brilliant type (I'm not; I have to work hard to get my As)?\n\nThe exams were hard but fair. They weren't tricky, but you absolutely need to be careful lest you'd make silly mistakes. But, from personal experience, and from what I gathered from Piazza, it was almost inevitable that people would make small mistakes, some of which had disproportionately large deductions, and so don't kick yourself too hard when you do make those types of mistakes.\n \nTake my review with a grain of salt. I'm the type who pushes myself very, very hard to fully master everything about anything, and I strive for the high scores in my classes, which I did in this class. This was a hard class but nowhere near as hard as 6505. This should be manageable if you have time. My biggest issue was that I didn't like the tests. You would have 4 questions and that was it. If you couldn't figure out a question (Dynamic Programming, Graphs, NP complete, or Max-Flow) you were screwed. But, you don't have a choice unless you do II for your specialization.\n\nThe TAs and Instructor are great and will help you as much as possible. One of the more difficult classes in the OMSCS programming. Light on the programming but heavy on the math. Be sure to practice the material a lot before taking this class. The questions are very similar to the book and class material but require a lot of practice. The topics may be somewhat useful to the job but is definitely more oriented towards learning for learning's sake.  This course is very hard but also very deep. It covers algorithm design techniques such as dynamic programming, divide and conquer, linear programming, greedy algorithms, reduction, and np completeness. \n\nThe course is almost entirely graded on exams. That makes it extra difficult.\n\nIt requires that you spend serious time doing a lot of exercises so you get very good at things like dynamic programming. (I'd suggest you get the book and start doing those exercises now.. and keep practicing DAILY)\n\nI like the course because it gave me a deep appreciation of graph algorithms that I had previously not cared for. If you put in HARD work you should survive. It won't be easy. So I tried this in the fall and had to drop. It was tough material for me to grasp, and I needed a better game plan than what I've done for other classes.\nAfter retaking it this spring, I wound up with an A. Here's how:\nSo this spring when I took the class, I went in knowing that I needed to work on this class every day. So for the first month or so, I did at least 1 dynamic programming problem a day. And not just the ones they recommend - I did all of the ones in the DPV text, all of the ones in the Kleinberg-Tardos text. I also watched Erik Demaine's lectures on dynamic programming. This is all in addition to the every day requirements of this class (the homework and lectures, etc). For dynamic programming - draw the damn table on your scratch paper. Every time...draw the table! When we got around to the NP Complete problems I did the same thing - at least one problem a day. The other topics were tough as well, but these 2 topics are the most crucial to passing this course.\nAnything he says in the lecture is a 'key idea' or 'key concept' is going to show up on a test. Even if you think, how could they possibly test that? Trust me, it'll be on the exam.\nAlso, watch the office hours.\nThere's a project (they choose a different project each semester), but it is not difficult and only worth 10% of the grade. The tests are the bulk of the grade (85%). Prof Vigoda is definitely a great lecturer. Excellent content covered in this course. This course will prepare you for some of the most important algorithms you need to know in a software engineering interview. Exams are pretty easy. Important note - do all HW problems (don't slack) and try to solve as many problems at the end of each chapter as possible. To be honest, I was expecting the exams to be more vigorous in a graduate level algorithm course. This class is very hard in terms of lot of things. Firstly, what to expect in the exam, you never know. However much preparation you do for this class is going to be less. In all other courses, we will get to do the projects where we get 1-2 weeks of time where we can figure out what needs to happen. In this course, we need to figure out in 3 hours of exam time. The exams are similar to homework but home works are not easy either, But you will get a week to figure out for homework where as exams can be very tricky. The professor won't ask any questions that does not make you think. He makes you think a lot during the course. The professor gives a lot of good hints on what to focus on during exam times. They are very very important. Pay close attention to what he says. He is very active on piazza and answers a lot of questions. The professor is very particular about dynamic programming. If you do well in this area, you will get A or B. Otherwise difficult to pass. He asks tough questions of Dynamic programming. It is his favorite part of the course. He initially scared the class saying that if we don't do well n dynamic programming, we will not pass. That happened to be true. This class required at-least 30-40 hours of work for me. So, my advice is not take this class with any other course\n\nThe positive thing about the course is, the curve. The B cut-off was 65% and A cut-off was 84% for Fall 2017.  Believe me, 65% is  not easy to get.. But the curve really helps at the end of the course. The text book used for the course is DPV- Algorithms (Dasgupta + Papapi........+Vazirani). Practice ALL problems from the exercise of this book to pass this course. This is a MUST.  Good luck. Keys to success follow the review...\n\nReview:   \nThe material for this course is pertinent and important. This is a difficult class that is challenging in two ways.  First, the material is difficult to learn and takes some time to fully understand. The book and lectures do a terrible job of explaining the material (the book is vague and the lectures focus primarily on mathematically proving the theorems behind the material rather than the testable material itself).    \n\nThe second part of the challenge in this course is the way the exams and homework are graded. The rubric calls on strict adherence to very specific terminology, formatting, and nitpicks minor details. This can be frustrating because even with a mastery of the material and after solving difficult questions, you may receive a substantial markdown for trivial \"omissions\" in your solution.\n\nAs you go through this course, I would encourage you to stick with it even if you're receiving poor grades. I did very poorly on the first two exams and still managed to pull through. The very first test is the trickiest... it gets a little bit easier after that. Grades are curved pretty significantly too. Worst case, at least you'll get to see all of the material before taking the class a second time, so you'll be better prepared the next round.\n\nKeys to success:    \n-Take this class by itself, it's really tough    \n-Practice problems from the text book and homework on a whiteboard or on paper over and over again.     \n-If you have time before the course starts, brush up on Dynamic Programming (DP)... it is the most heavily weighted topic that takes the most time to master.    \n-In regards to DP:  focus your efforts on variations of LIS, LCS, and Knapsack type problems... there's no need to get more complicated than that    \n-Pay very close attention to the details of the professor's solutions (such as HW solutions) and make your solutions follow his particular format and verbiage    \n-Don't blow off the project: it's free points... it only takes a couple days to tackle & it'll be in python most likely.    \n-Youtube videos with graphical depictions of the algorithms in action really help\n\nI wish you the very best of luck!! The fact that I hated this course isn't a reflection on the professor (Dr. Vigoda) or TAs. They did an amazing job and were very active, I just hate theoretical math. This is a very hard class. If you are like me and 1) were not good in math theory and 2) have not done this sort of thing since college, then this will probably be really hard. I would recommend doing all the homework problems, and all the problems related to the material in the text book. When you are done with those, find another text book and do all the problems there. Practice is the only way you are going to pass, unless you are just really good at this sort of thing.\n\nThere is a project but it isn't worth too much, though it took me a long time to complete. The homework problems are more or less meaningless for your grade, but very important if you want to learn the material. The exams are all closed book. You get partial credit, but that means you made smaller mistake, and you still lose a very large portion, so you really need to know the material. To be fair to Dr. Vigoda, he tells you what he expects you to know to pass, and he holds you to that. Grading is very quick on exams for the amount of students and the content in them. Office hours are very good too, and I had to watch almost all of them to get at least some grasp of the materials.\n\nI would recommend taking this class early, but not before you get some study habits down. It took me 15 PTO days, and studying almost every night to get down most of this material. If I took this when I first started OMSCS (I have 24 credits as it stands) then I would have not been able to adjust to the workload and the amount of effort needed to pass. Also, it is probably going to suck. Many students did not do well on one or more exams (myself included), and though you will see the stereotypical \"look at how smart I am!\" tech students in piazza, remember that others are struggling as much as you are. Don't drop too early, so that you at least get some of the material down, and plow through it.  Great effort from the TA's and Professor Vigoda. You'll do well if you practice doing many problems, from both the textbook and other sources. Keep doing problems. You have to do many problems to truly understand the subject matter. Very rewarding class and the benefits are great for interviews later in life. \n\nYou can't bullshit your way through this course, and that's a good thing. So don't try to, or you'll crash and burn. This course is one of my favorite courses. It is a nice mental stimulation. It is not easy but it is not too hard also. If you do the practice problems and the homework problems you will get a good grasp of the topics. There are plenty of more problems in the textbook as well.  The professor,Eirc Vigoda, is very active and engaged in Piazza. The TAs were great. There are lots and lots of practice problems and office hours to help you prepare for the exam. I did very well on this course by simply studying using the practice problems provided and the textbook. For additional reference, I used the MIT OpenCourseWare lectures. Make sure you join the slack channel also.  So, this class was pretty hard for me. I had next to zero algorithms background, but the topic is everywhere in CS and I wanted to fill in a lot of knowledge gaps by taking a supposedly-more-practical-than-CCA algorithms class, and I got it here. There were 3 exams and a final, 1 project, and homework. Exams were about the same level of difficulty as the homework, so the best advice I could give is to practice doing problems a lot, especially with Dynamic Programming and NP-completeness reductions. If you want an A in this class, you will work for it - exams are regularly 4/5 problems worth 25/20% each, so if you mess one up, there goes your grade. \n\nTAs are really responsive, and the lectures are very well done. I found them exceptionally clear if you pay attention, and more straightforward than textbooks in terms of the explanations on average, but not always (compared to Dasgupta and CLRS). The class was exceptionally well run, and this was probably the biggest factor in my passing at all - homework and exam solutions (though not the final exam) were released the day after the submission window was closed, so you can figure out where the differences were, and learn from your mistakes immediately. There were office hours all the time, though I didn't attend them regularly. \n\nIf you're wondering whether or not to take this, I'm going to recommend it highly. It's hard and time consuming, but it'll enhance your experience in other courses. For example: my section of Reinforcement Learning used Linear Programming and Dynamic Programming throughout the semester, and my (admittedly old) Computer Networks section had a Bellman-Ford project. All of these topics are covered in depth in GA, and will probably be significantly easier with prior exposure to them. It's hard to get in because all but one degree specializations currently require it, but keep at it and you'll be glad you did. This class was one of the hardest I've taken in this program. It's extremely exam based (85% of grade) and the concepts take a lot of time and practice to master. I spent a ton of time each week watching the lectures and doing practice problems in order to keep up with the course. For each exam I probably did 20-30 practice problems to prepare...and still didn't perform as well as I would have hoped. The exams and homework are all handwritten. There is one project that was actually really fun. Overall this class was really good...like I learned a ton. But it is very difficult - I wouldn't recommend pairing this class with another one. Oh, and the grade is curved significantly.  All I can say is... never give up.  There were so many times I wanted to quit because it was so difficult, but I persevered and I am pretty sure I did well enough on the final to pass.  The homeworks seem almost impossible at times.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  If you can't do some of the problems just do the best you can (they are only worth 5% of the overall grade) and wait for the solutions to be released and then go back and learn how to do the problems.  The exam questions are similar to the homeworks and actually seem a little easier than the homework problems.  Professor Vigoda says he wants the HW to challenge you.  So, if you can understand how to do them, you should be pretty well prepared for the exams.  To prepare for this class, you can go to the course website to see the topics and watch some youtube videos on them.  The MIT OCW videos were also helpful at times for a different perspective.  Dr. Vigoda places a strong emphasis on Dynamic Programming.  He once stated on the forums, if you don't know DP you won't pass this class.  DP boggled my mind when I first encountered the topic.  However, I leave the class relatively confident that I could apply it one day if necessary.  The lecture videos are excellent, he repeats the information enough that it sinks in better than some courses where they just state the facts and immediately move on.  I can't believe I'm saying this after how difficult it was... but after it was all over I actually liked it.  If it was easy, it wouldn't have the same meaning or impart the same feeling of accomplishment and that's why we're at GaTech, right? This was my 10th and final class in the program (I ended up with a B). As far as the difficulty, it was the hardest course I took, though I would say that the concepts themselves werent terribly difficult, more so that you need to stay on top of the schedule and practice practice practice with the exercises in the book and elsewhere. The arrangement of the topics (DP then Graph then P/NP) front loaded the difficulty somewhat so it wasnt too much for me to recover after not doing well on the first exam. For those worried about needing a B, the cutoff was 65% (84% for an A). And much kudos to Dr Vigoda, he is a great professor and made the class enjoyable. I absolutely loved this course. My favorite course ever by miles. The material was fabulous, the structure of the course was excellent, the organization was immaculate. Kudos to Professor Vigoda and the TAs. \n\nI didn't find it all that difficult although I seemed to be in the minority on that opinion. I wish there were a sequel because it left me wanting more.\n\nThere are 4 timed proctored exams and they are 85% of your grade. To prepare, get the \"Algorithms\" Dasgupta book and do all the exercises at the end of the chapters. The exams are problem solving questions similar to those. All chapters are covered by the course except the last 2.  I also found the CLR book useful at times as supplement.\n\nThe most important thing to do in advance in terms of preparation for the course is to become skilled at Dynamic Programming. The first exam comes fast, and many students get such a devastatingly low score due to inability to solve the DP problems that they can never recover.\n\nThe partial credit on exams is generous -- too generous maybe -- so whatever happens, make sure to write something.\n\nThis course ought to be required for every specialization. It is the #1 must take course in the program. I can't imagine how anyone could really call themselves an MSCS without it! By far the best OMSCS class I took. Dr. Vigoda's lectures were engaging, thorough, and provocative. The material is difficult and the tests are hard, but everything is presented in such a clear way (and the grading is fair with a generous curve) that the class isn't overly difficult. This class prepared me in ways that I didn't think were possible and completely changed my mind on the benefits of the OMSCS program. Excellent professor (Dr. Vigoda) and TA team!  The material itself is difficult but the work load for me was fairly light.  The exams determine most of your grade but it is very important to do the homework in order to understand the material.  Dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP Completeness consumed most of the class with a few other things such as FTT and RSA thrown in lightly.  Memorization does very little good on the tests as they are all about the application of the concepts (i.e. use the algorithms from class to show how to solve this seemingly unrelated problem that you've never seen before).  Understanding Big O notation is required.  The book is also required for homework purposes and reading it is also important.  Surprisingly well run for a first run course and surprisingly fast grading for a written exam based course.  Test solutions are hand written and scanned while using Proctortrack. This is THE class to take in this program. Perhaps the best one!\nCourse structure is unique and heavily based on exams (85% of grade from exams. Only 5% from homeworks and 10% from project)\n\nLectures are super useful and clear. However reading the book is a must to fully grasp the subject. I did well overall, however I attribute it to putting in effort to solve bunch of practice problems from text book. I can see someone who just relied on lectures, didn't do much practice on problems, would have less chance to do well.\n\nTAs are simply the best. There were 3 office hours per week where TAs would patiently answer all questions from students. A big thanks to them :)\n\nProf. Vigoda is very active and friendly on Piazza. He greatly cares about his subject and students. This class was very well organized with great support from TAs and the prof. Even though some of the concepts were hard to undertand, the Udacity video was very well made and it was much better than other videos available in public.  There are 3 mid terms and 1 final exam and you need to make sure you understand the concept well and study some extra problems on top of the homework assignments.  Exams are not extremely hard but they were designed such that you need to use the concept you learned and apply to the problems that are similar but different from homework problems. i.e. just memorizing the answers will not work.  The final was harder than mid terms in my opinion but you have a few weeks to prepare for it.   I actually really liked this class. There is a fair amount of work involved but it is manageable. The math was never overwhelming, and our arguments aren't required to be excessively rigorous as long as they are valid. \n\nI am very excited that I now understand things like linear programing, max flow, the fast Fourier transform and RSA pretty well: all these seemed completely mysterious to me before I took this class but they all turned out to be pretty easy to understand from the lectures.\n\nThe format of the exams and assignments is a pretty weird: you are given a template that you need to print, fill out and **scan** (there are phone apps to do that). Technically for the assignments you can just edit the LaTeX but for the exams you do have to scan your filled out template while being filmed by ProctorTrack... Weird.\n\nAlso be aware that there are **a lot** of exams (3 \"midterms\" and 1 final) and that the assignments and projects count for very little (5% for the assignments, 15% for the project).\n\nOne criticism however: especially at the beginning of the class, I ended up needing to do a lot of regrade requests for my assignments and first exam which I felt were graded incorrectly harshly. Out of 4 regrade requests I did, 3 got accepted, which shows that there was indeed some excessively zealous grading going on. Things got better as the class went on, but if you take this class, do check your feedback carefully and don't hesitate to request regrades if something seems way wrong. This class is very hard, not because the material is difficult, but because to me it seemed very rushed. This was the only course I took this semester and I struggled to keep up with the amount of practice and preparation that was required. \n\nIf you are reading this review and hoping to prepare for the class, study DP, NP Reductions and Max-Flow as well as Min-Cut. These are the main topics you will be tested on. There are graph algorithms as well, but you will never be asked to find a shortest path or anything like that, you will need to know how the algorithm works and based on the problem presented you will need to identify whether or not the algorithm can be used to solve the problem.\n\nThe lectures in my opinion are only good if you read the book first, then watch them once as you take notes and then watch them again just for content. So in other words they are not as good as other OMSCS courses. If you plan on grasping the material just by looking at the lectures, you probably won't because the lectures go quite fast and they only explain the basics of how to do the problems. A lot of times I also found myself going on YouTube to try to look at different explanations because I thought the explanations given were either not clear or just not good enough. \n\nI suggest taking this course on its own and if you have a few classes left, perhaps a semester before you graduate so you can re-take it if you do not get a B. \n\nI would also suggest to become a regular on Piazza and do all the homeworks even though they are not worth many points. Basically, if you know how to do the homework, you will have the needed knowledge to pass the test.  This class was very well taught. So, the material wasn't too hard to grasp from the lectures, however it did require a lot of work in practice problems on top of the homework. Finally the one thing which I felt could be improved is the amount of feedback on exams and homework. The feedback was too brief to be of much use for improvement.  This class is really well done. The lectures are clear and interesting, and Dr Vigoda actively participates on Piazza! It's hard, it's theoretical (your brain gets tired), but it's super-doable (even for someone with little to no formal background, like me). \n\nI personally never manage to prepare for classes ahead of time; and I frankly think with this class, the best preparation you could do would be to come in with a clear head, excited and ready to learn. Once you're in the midst of it, I recommend lots of practice problems and active participation on Piazza (trying to explain concepts to others or formulate clear questions is a great exercise in and of itself). \n\nIt's an exam-based class, and the tests are challenging in that you likely haven't seen the exact problems previously, but they're very fair, and you can figure them out with a solid understanding of the material (as long as you don't get too stressed about seeing something unfamiliar). \n\nSo, take it. You'll be glad you did. This course is very challenging. By far the most challenging class of the program for me (and this is my 9th course)\n\nThe content presentation is excellent. The homework, tests and project are all well constructed, fairly graded, and directly inline with the content covered in the course materials. However, it is not a simple regurgitation of the materials. It is an application of the materials and so you really have to understand and practice the use of the materials (the algorithms mostly) in solving problems because you will have to be able to apply them to other situations on the tests. \n\nThe grading is heavily weighted towards tests with 85% of the grade coming from tests (10% from project and 5% from homework). \n\nHomework, while it has little impact on the grade is a must-do. In fact, to succeed in the class I would say that you have to go out and find other homework from other courses and do those problems as well. \n\nThe project was a coding assignment which was interesting but not too challenging once you wrapped your head around it. They have indicated that they may add an additional coding project in a future iteration of the course, but don't plan on reducing the grading focus on exams. \n\nThis class has probably had the greatest participation in Piazza of both the instructor and the TA staff of any of the courses I have been in and that has been very helpful in understanding some of the nuances around the algorithms and their application. \n\nOverall a great class. I am in the Fall 2017 class which is the first offering. \n\nThis class is the class that replaced CCA; do not be fooled, its not far easier than CCA. While there are mostly no formal proofs involved (although you will have to give informal proofs), there is still a ton of material and concepts. The math isn't terrible, and everything you forgot is re-hashed by Dr. Vigoda so you can get back up to speed (although for graphs you will want to do a refresher on your own; otherwise this isnt needed). \n\nTo prep: I suggest going to the course website https://8803ga. wordpress. com/ and watching at least the first 2/3 of the lectures (the professor links to the videos on this page). I'd particularly suggest, at a minimum, getting re-acquainted with asymptotic notation and the basics of graphs (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and basic graph terms are either lightly covered or not covered, depending, but you will need to know them),  \n\nThe class is do-able, but be willing to prep OR be willing to spend 40 hour weeks on the course. If you are already comfortable with asymptotic notation and graph theory, Dynamic Programming (DP) and NP-Complete (NP) will take you the most amount of time, so if you have a good handle on those going in it will make life far easier. I would suggest being able to at least hold a light conversation in all of these topics; with no exposure to these, 80-100 hours spent on them before the class will surely pay off.  I really enjoyed this class but found it very easy. I've taken ML, AI, RL and all those were far more time consuming for me (more than 20hrs/w for those). If you have taken an undergrad class on dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and NP completeness, there isn't a ton of new information, just more in depth. If algorithms and theory just make sense to you (I find I do much better in courses on math and theory than practice), then this course isn't really that difficult. If you found your algorithms class difficult in undergrad, or have never taken one before, expect a rough ride (as you can see based on the other reviews). The homework questions were harder than the exam questions, so just be sure you can do the homework questions and you will do fine. None of the exam questions were out of the blue and were very reasonable given what the lectures and homework covered. All I did to study for the exams was practice the hw problems and I recieved >100% on the final grade. For this class just practice practice practice. No need to study useless trivia from the lectures (aside from complexity of common algorithms). I've rated this as 'hard', but really its just quite different than the other classes in the program, more theoretical vs the project-based I've enjoyed in other classes.  Thankfully, its not just a class full of proofs. \n\nThe instruction is clear, professor and TAs are responsive on Piazza, the exams are fair, and grading on assignments and exams was quick (and lenient). Perhaps this is easier for those who had algorithms as an undergrad, you but don't need it to be successful in this class.  \n\nWith the exception of the dynamic programming, homework  only took a couple hours to complete.  However, doing only the assigned problems was not enough for me to do well on the exams, I did most of the problems in the book and others I could find online as well.  For me,  workload was light most weeks,  but spiked just before exams.\n\nI don't think theres a need to prepare in advance.  I came in without a CS undergrad or advance prep and did well.  But if you like to prep, get a head start with the dynamic programming -- I found that the topic that took the longest to master.   This is a tough course. If you do not have ANY background in algorithms, mathematical notation, or informal proofs, you are going to struggle to play catch up.\n\nThere is very little programming, most of the algorithm work is done in pseudo-code. You can front load learning about Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer algorithms, and graphing algorithms.\n\nThis class and Machine Learning are the two best ran classes that I have taken in the program.  I took this class for the first online offering. I really enjoyed the class and learned a ton.  However, it was a huge amount of work.  Working a full time job and a new child, all of my free time was spent on the course.  During the first two weeks (Dynamic Programming), I was ready to drop the class but my wife convinced me otherwise.  I'm glad I didn't drop it.  It took a ton of work in the beginning.  Perhaps 30 hours a week doing sample problems and Dynamic Programming finally clicked.  After Dynamic Programming and exam 1, we moved on to Graph Algorithms.  This was a little easier for me since I have supported networks that run BFS/DFS and I had a working knowledge of some algorithms.  Finally, NP-Complete and Linear Programming.    This course definitely seems to be front loaded in difficulty.  I would suggest you put as much effort as you can to learn dynamic programming.   For many it is the toughest topic in the course.  Once it clicks, you are set.  So, work hard, don't give up hope and good luck.  I ended up with an A in the course but I was about to drop it during the second week.  So, don't be discouraged if DP takes you a long time to become efficient. This was my last class in the program and by far the hardest class I have taken. I needed it to finish up the ML specialization and found it to be a very different class from the others I have taken. There is very little actual programming (1 programming assignment this semester that was relatively easy and able to be completed with little code once the concept and problem is understood). The class focusses on theory and math and consists of HW assignments that are worth so little that they are practically optional and 4 tests. This model made it very easy to fall behind if you weren't diligently studying and doing practice problems to prepare for the tests. Professor Vigoda is awesome. The videos are high quality and straight to the point. I liked that he explained concepts in what I found an easy to understand manner. He clearly tried to use simple language and provide multiple examples to drive points home. This class is a lot of work. I took this class along with DB Systems and I stuck it out but overall would recommend taking this class alone. Very rewarding and the staff was super responsive especially the professor. Class was run spectacularly especially considering it was the first semester. I learned so much the past few months that help to put other computer science topics in perspective. This class was both challenging and fun.  It was extremely well presented and executed.  The material is derived from an excellent textbook.\n\nUnless you've recently taken an upper level algorithms course prior or have a recent and strong math background, you will probably have to work hard to do well.  Some students could have used additional preparation before enrolling (e.g., their math background was extremely weak and hadn't even encountered high school level calculus or discrete math).  If you fall into that category, take a discrete math course or find some way to fill in those gaps.\n\nMy advice: don't underestimate the importance of the homeworks and practice for the exams.  Do all of the homeworks, all of the lectures, and stay current with the recommended course schedule (which can be demanding).  If you find yourself having an idle week in this class, you're likely doing it wrong.  \n\nDon't let students who comment about \"no formal proofs\" deceive you.  Usually, that \"formality\" is seen at the undergraduate level and you are expected to prove your claims on much of the material (and understand proofs given in the lectures).  For example, having an intuitive understanding of induction helps with dynamic programming problems and when you get to NP complete problems, those are proofs.  Either way, it's not something to be afraid of but rather to embrace as part of your journey into the core of computer science.   I believe the difficulty of this class is very much related to your preparedness. I generally enjoy math and also took an algos class on Coursera a couple years ago, and I thought the course was highly enjoyable and not too difficult. If you are in a similar boat, you probably won't have much trouble with this course. On the other hand, if this is your first exposure to algorithms, I would highly recommend priming yourself for this course by taking a free algos class first, or you may find this course to be a lot of work.\n\nAnother key to this class is simply to practice a lot. A lot of the homeworks and exams come down to figuring out ways to apply the algos to a novel problem, sort of like puzzles where the algos are the tools you have to work with. Once you are in this mindset, though, it's pretty fun thinking of ways to solve the problems.\n\nOne last note about this course is that the instructional staff is excellent. Compared to other courses I've taken, Dr. Vigoda is much more active on Piazza. Probably the second-most instructor participation of any course after SDP. Dr. Vigoda was very occasionally a bit snippy here and there, but I'd rather have massive presence with occasional errors than a total lack of presence which seems to be the norm (or at least the median) for OMSCS courses. There were also several TAs that were also active and helpful, more than any other class I've taken. Grading for all homeworks and exams took less than one week (though the project took over a month) which is critically important from a pedagogical standpoint, yet virtually unheard of in this program, so major kudos to the staff in this regards. GA is definitely the best OMSCS course along with ML / RL, all because of the tremendous efforts from prof. Vigoda and his TA. \n\nDifficulty is just right. Exam questions could have been alot more difficult, but prof. Vigoda gauged it perfectly so that they are very manageable. This class is difficult, but not impossible. You definitely have to put in a lot of work, or you will fall behind! While the 10 homeworks are worth a total of 5% of your grade, don't slack on them. They prepare you for the 3 midterms and 1 final which are the bulk of your grade. There is also a project for 10% of your grade, which is the only coding you will officially do in this class, though future iterations may include another project. \n\nThe homeworks are generally problems in the text (DPV), or very similar to them. While the previous class required a lot of proofs, this class requires informal proofs and pseudo-code. The book is definitely required, and I recommend also getting CLRS for the graphing section. The most math I encountered was during the FFT section where we had to work with complex numbers and roots of unity. \n\nPrepare for this class by watching the lectures, reading DPV and doing the problems. There's no real substitute for doing the problems. https://8803ga. wordpress. com This is a hard class, it takes a lot of time to understand the material it's very difficult.   The entire grade is based upon exams, the exams average 4 questions and are difficult.   Most people either love or hate this class and it depends on your background and understanding of the material prior to taking this class.   It's a requirement for graduation and the class it NP-HARD.   An absolute must. Don\u2019t call yourself a computer scientist if you haven\u2019t taken this class. It\u2019s about solving problems, efficiently. And it\u2019s what interviewers ask about.\n\n- Lectures are very clear and indepth. Didn\u2019t need the book. Also any prereqs are covered in the lectures, except for graph theory. If you\u2019re dying to prep before the course starts, maybe Graph Theory and BFS.Dijkstra are a good idea. Other than that I don;t see a reason to start early. Go into this class with a clear mind cause you\u2019re gonna think and study A LOT.\n- Exams are fair. Not easy, and not impossible. Just the right balance to test how well you understand the material, and can apply it to new problems.\n- AWESOME staff. Professor is very active on Piazza, he is a true educator that cares about his students. Same with TAs who held 3 office hours per weekto answer HW questions, and any otherproblems from the book...etc.\n- HWs, althoughof very low weight are extremely important. As well as practicing on your own with extra problems from the book or anywhere else. Practice is key here. You gotta train your brain on these kinds of problems. Don\u2019t be disappointed if you can\u2019t solve any of the Dynamic Programming problems. Just make sure you practice enough, and you\u2019ll be fine.\n- There was a coding project. It was very easy and not much of a learning opportunity. There\u2019s room for improvement here.\n- 3 midterms and a final. Midterms are not cumulative, so you can dive deep and practice specific topics as much as you want.\n- This class is a marathon run. There a re no dull moments. Every week you\u2019ll either be busy working on a HW or prepping for an exam. That\u2019s why try not to burn yourself by prepping too much before the semester starts.\n\nBottom line. This is the best run class in OMSCS. And one of the most important to take. Can\u2019t believe there\u2019s a specialization (Interactive Intelligence) that doesn\u2019t mandate this course. Preface: I had not taken a formal algorithms course before. This class kicked me in the rear early. I very early considered dropping the course cause I did terribly on the first exam. However, I stuck through it and am expected to get an A now. I hadn't taken the old CS 6505, but from what I've heard it was crazy difficult with its proofs. In this class, there is little to no emphasis on formal proofs. There is a bit of proving NP-completeness at the end of the course, but it's not very rigorous I'd say. The key to the course: study, study, study.  If you study as much as you can for this course, you'll get a B or A. If you don't put in the hours, you will likely not do well. I dropped this class in spite of being very satisfied with the teaching. I dropped because I didn't put enough time in doing the exercises as the class requires. Its not enough to be able to solve a few problems. One needs to have a lot of practice (as others pointed out). I don't think this class requires too much time a week. Instead I would recommend daily practice. \nCaveat: my comments are as a person with a CS background. If you don't have a CS background there's probably some significant prep work you need to do in Algorithms and Data Structures to pass this class. It won't be easy. This was my 9th course in the program and this course is by far my favorite course of the program. It is my favorite because I find the content very useful and will definitely help you do well on software engineering interviews. Eric is a great professor and he is very active on Piazza. It also becomes addicting, because once you solve a problem it motivates you to solve another. If you want to prepare for the course, I will review Dynamic Programming, Big-O notation/Master Theorem, Basic Graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, Djikstra, etc, and NP. The course is very challenging and I liked that the homeworks are challenging you to prepare for the exam. If you understand the concepts behind the homework, you will do fine on the exam. Excellent course, very well run especially for a new course. The lectures are great and the professor and TAs do a fantastic job. I recommend watching the lectures and reading the textbook. This is my 10th and final course before graduating, and while it isn't as interesting content wise as some of the previous courses, it is one of the best run. Ok, without too much lyrics here is what you need to do in order to succeed in this class:\n\n1. Become good at dynamic programming! This one is the most important and the hardest. Learn how to solve typical most common problems like LIS, LCS etc. Get Dasgupta algorithms book and start solving DP problems (chapter 6). Learn how to write a recurrence and pseudocode for them using pencil and paper! Once you are comfortable - go to leetcode, or hackerrank and practice them as much as you can. Code them if you want, but keep in mind that you'd have to be able to HANDWRITE your solutions!\n\n2. Learn about roots of unity in the context of Fast Fourier Transform. To be more precise - understand, how to multiply 2 integers using FFT Divide&Conquer approach. This one is also one of the most challenging topics. The lectures are good, but assuming you know the basics, which I didn't, so I had to dig all over the internet to understand it.\n\n(If you are good with 2 things above - you'll most likely succeed. Other stuff is also important, but not as much as previous 2. You'd still have to practice all of it, but other topics a bit easier to grasp.)\n\n3. Brush up on modular arithmetic, RSA cryptosystem and all the theory behind it.\n\n4. Learn the basics of the graph theory: paths, flows, spanning trees, DFS, BFS, SCC, Djkstra etc.\n\n5. Don't worry too much about proving problems to be NP-complete, those are fairly straightforward, although, practicing wouldn't hurt at all.\n\n6. Practice linear programming problems, but only after you are good at 1 and 2 (or if 3rd exam is approaching).\n\n7. Make sure you have enough time for the entire semester, and don't hope for the last night preparation. It won't work, unless you are already pro in all the topics above. \n\n8. Do all the homeworks, and do them EARLY!!! They are hard, although worth almost nothing in terms of grade. Doing them is crucial for quality exam preparation, and if you don't do them - you're screwed!\n\n9. Do not rush dropping the course if you screw up on the first exam. There will be plenty of opportunities to catch up, at last you can drop with W after the 2nd exam (if nothing changes next semesters).\n\nThe course is absolutely amazing, and it will develop your brain big time. The lectures are of the highest quality and very helpful. So, work hard, be optimistic, and good luck!\n\n \n\n\n\n\n - 8th class for me (Prev: ML, RL, CV, HPC, IOS, DVA, AI) \n- Well Organized\n- Awesome Content\n- To the point exams, appropriate in length \n- If you are planning to interview with a tech company, take this course\n- Prof Vigoda and his team of TAs are very responsive and helpful \n- Not esoteric theoretical\n- Multiple (three) midterms, allows for smaller syllabus per exam, helps to dig deeper\n- Do all of the text execises, not just the ones identified by the instructor, would help to reinforce concepts", 
    "CSE-6040": "  This course is okay. It gave me some exposures to Python but I don't feel the exposure is in-depth enough. I would actually prefer to have a proper introductory course into Python itself, rather than applications from the start. As I encounter business problems in work, the need for a solid foundation on Python would become obvious. The other reviews got it right. Very Python heavy. I had a couple introductory courses under my belt. One from Coursera's Python for Analytics and the other was Udacity's Data Science course. That was my strong point going in. My weak point was definitely the mathematics and linear algebra. I would definitely recommend learning the basics of matrix multiplication and getting comfortable with that. The tests are long. People have been averaging between 10-16 hours actively working, but most people are making A's on them and there are only 3 of them. Fantastic class - it's basically an intro to python with an emphasis on coding efficiently and coding for data sets. While its primary focus was more on the underlying mechanism of commonly-used packages in python, the course was nonetheless effective when getting students to think about what was required to succeed in the space.\n\nAs stated before, during the Spring 2018 semester there was a massive disconnect between the homework assignments and the exams. There were three exams, all of which were open-source barring collaboration with people (but open-google, short of posting your ask on stackoverflow). However, the exams consisted basically of 6 homework assignments for you to complete in as much detail as possible. Exam 1 (24 hour max) was quite reasonable as the first few homeworks were very easy and were more on the programming, but Exams 2 (24 hour max) and 3 (36 hour max) ended up being harder variants of the homework problems to be done in a shorter period of time. I still aced the class, but the exams were definitely marathons (Exam 1: 4-6 hours, Exam 2: 18 hours, Exam 3: 10 hours, but only did enough to get 80% since I'd already guaranteed my A). Future iterations of this course will probably see updated exam logistics.\n\nNonetheless, nobody said it would be easy, and all things considered it was a deep enough course to justify an intro to programming for data science at the graduate level. For this student at least, a lot was learned. \n\nBackground: Proficient in coding in other languages such as MATLAB, SQL, some other object oriented programming languages, took Regression/6501 prior to or during this course, strong calculus/linear algebra/diff eq background from engineering days. I had zero programming experience going into this course, so as others have said it was EXTREMELY difficult. However with the high value of homework assignments and extension of the test taking window (test 1 was 2hrs, test 2 and the final were 24hrs) I was able to succeed in this course. However, I still lack a great deal of basic Python skills, so I highly recommend a good working knowledge of coding prior to taking this course.  Found this to be hard due to a relative lack of Python exposure (came at this from an R background). Would absolutely recommend having working knowledge of Python prior to starting. Was able to pick up enough as I went along; I started breezing through Datacamp Python tutorials by the end (when the concepts in the class become a bit more involved). Spent 10-15 hours a week at first covering basic Python stuffs, slimmed down as the semester went on and I became more familiar with the syntax. You need to have taken some amount of Python basics before coming into the course, and having a programming background in another language would also make it easier. I had a strong non-Python programming background as well as an intro Python class and I  found the class pretty easy. However, people with less experience found it had a very steep learning curve and could be very difficult.\n\nAssignments are released weekly but you have two weeks to do them. The first programming exam was timed (2 hours), but after feedback from students they decided to change it to a 24 hour exam that must be completed within a 7-day window. I found the exam still only took me 2-3 hours to complete. The final was also 24 hours in 7 days, so they will likely keep that format going forward. \n\nAssignments and exams are in Jupyter notebooks that walk you though the exercises. Lectures correspond to most of the notebooks, but if you're a quick learner you can get almost all the material just from the notebook. Instead of writing the entire large program, the notebook includes some code written by the instructors and you write code to fill in the blanks.\n\nOverall, I found it pretty easy, and it paired well with ISYE 6501 (Intro Analytics). The instructors had some trouble with getting assignments up on time, class organization, and responding to Piazza in a timely manner, but I think most of that had to do with the fact it was the first semester the course was offered online.\n\nMy one course content complaint would be that the end of the course, which seemed like the whole point/the culmination of the course, was extremely rushed at the end (3 shorter assignments due within 2 days of each other). I wish less time had been spent on the Python basics at the beginning and more time was spent on that actual analytical modeling methods. Great class!  Has been my favorite so far.  The videos are excellent and the HW and exams are fair and a fun challenge. If you want to learn Python at a very fast pace and ready for grueling 24 hours exams then you would like this course. Just be prepared to put in a lot during the exam. Few things I wish were better: Lectures can be more intuitive with helpful examples, talk in more detail about the logic explained in the videos. Homeworks are easy as compare to the exam. So I feel there is a gap which can be filled by making homework little more challenging.\nI strongly feel exam format needs to be less lengthy than current. This is excellent course with well thought structure, assignments and exams. Everything (assignments and exams) was done in same online grading system in jupyter-notebook, so there won't be any logistical issues during exams, since basically exams are just like assignment with 24hours-36hours time limit. \n\nThis course use python language, and despite my many years experience using python on daily basis, I still learned a lot in this course, so yeah its absolutely highly recommended course regardless of your experience. \n\nFor new to python students, this course will teach you from basic, but it getting tough quickly, so its better to gain some familiarity with numpy/pandas lib in python beforehand. I came into this class with very minimal coding experience (just blitzed through about 2/3rds of 1301 in the month before this class began). As a result, I found this course to be very difficult. Many people in the class had significant programming experience, so probably didn't have as much difficulty. But even for these, there were challenges.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, you have a weekly jupyter notebook with roughly ten exercises to complete. These aren't too bad and one can often google their way through them. In fact, for all of the homeworks, I only missed one exercise. In the end, my homework score was 99.5%+. Homework counts for 50% of the grade.\n\nThe workbooks are released two weeks before they are due. So get yourself a bit ahead in the beginning and make a habit of turning them in early. Much less stress that way, for me at least. It was common to see people on Slack, Sunday night before homework is due, asking questions about the first exercise. Not sure what they were thinking.\n\nThe exams, though, were a different animal. For those, you'd get about twice as many exercises (usually 20-25) and could be significantly harder than the homework. AND, you had 24 hours (for the midterms) and 36 hours for the final to complete them. This resulted in marathon work sessions for most of us. In fact, in a poll we created in Slack, the average time spent on midterm 2 was about 17 hours. In my case, I did absolutely terribly on them, but, with the homework counting for so much of the grade, I was able to at least pass the class with a mediocre grade. \n\nIf you have significant coding background (or a strong natural aptitude) you'll be fine. But if you're like me, get ready for a lot of work and stress. \n\nIndeed, my biggest criticism is that I've never been in a class where there was such a disconnect between homework and exams in terms of performance. Usually, if one is doing well with homework, one should likewise expect to succeed on the tests. That is definitely not the case here. \n\nGood luck Overall this was a decent course.  The lectures were pretty weak in my opinion, some weeks it was just a TA giving you the answers to the homework.  The homework assignments were pretty solid and the format of using Jupyter notebooks was really nice.  \n\nThe worst part of the course were the exams.  They were quite lengthy and exhausting.  It felt like the homework didn't prepare you at all for the exam so there was a lot of trying to research and learn stuff during the exam which adds to the amount of time needed to complete it.  That said, the final was relatively easy compared to the midterms so that was nice.  One thing that I didn't figure out until the final that might have been helpful for the midterms: instead of spending an entire work day (8 hours) on the exam, work 4 hours one night, then go to sleep, work 4 hours the next day.  The only down side to this is that if you need all 24 hours to complete the exam, you waste some up front (note, the longest I spent on an exam was only 13 hours or so).  I found this course to be very enjoyable in general. The lectures were a bit hit or miss, but the assignments were usually good about guiding you through the problems. I came into the course with some programming experience but only very little exposure to Python, and I thought it was a great introduction to Python including Pandas, NumPy and SciPy. The later assignments focused more on mathematical theory and concepts useful to data analytics such as optimization problems and algorithms, which were very math-y but also very helpful to reinforce my understanding of the workings behind these methods. It helped that there was a refresher on the linear algebra and calculus included as part of the instructional materials.\n\nThe fact that the assignments are autograded with unlimited submissions means you have as much time as you need to test your solutions and get as much credit as you can. The assignments are released well ahead of time so if you need to get a head start and give yourself some time off between assignments that's totally feasible. Some assignments were much easier than others, so I'd say the avg workload was about 4-8 hours per week.\n\nThe exams worked much the same way homework did, open note/internet with no proctoring, but were much longer than the typical homework assignment and with a time limit (both midterms were 24 hrs, the final was 36 hrs). I spent about 5-8 hours with each of the three exams, but I know other students struggled with the amount of time they needed to complete the tests. The professor and TAs were responsive and made some changes to the exam format to help accommodate the students who had issues though, which I appreciated even though it didn't impact me much.\n\nOverall, highly recommended course. As someone who had a programming background, I think it's still worthwhile to take unless you're already very comfortable using Python, Pandas, NumPy and SciPy. This class should be fairly easy for anyone who knows python already. It is possible to complete the class if you have a programming background but little python knowledge, you just need to get up to speed in the beginning. Overall I felt I learned a lot and was challenged in different ways throughout the course.  I'll not repeat what others have said regarding the Spring 2018 offering.\n\n**Infinite Submits** One of the great features of this course was the auto-grader feature that allowed for an \"infinite\" number of submits, taking the highest grade. This completely negated the pressure to \"get it right the first time\" and fostered a \"let's just try this\" workflow that is very similar to how \"real\" programming gets done. Contrast this with other courses that have a \"first submit == only submit.\"\n\n**Honor Code** Homeworks were open-everything, including some conceptual collaboration. Exams were open-note, open-course-materials, open-Stack-Overflow, everything but collaboration with other students. Again, contrast this with the use of ProctorTrack\u00ae in other classes that wouldn't even let you you leave your chair during an exam.\n\n**Jupyter Notebooks** Just an example of how well thought out everything in this course was, in terms of \"ramping up,\" Jupyter notebooks were used via Vocareum for both homework and exams. Downloading of notebooks for local (or other cloud) use was permitted. I now see \"Jupyter notebooks\" offered everywhere online, and Jupyter Lab was easily integrated into my personal workflow, as well.\n\n**CSE 6040 Slack** Was the primary means of sanity and mutual support. Much better than the Piazza mess.\n\n**Pairing with ISYE 6501** The two courses nested nicely. Early on, learning R and Python simultaneously was a bit hectic, but as ISYE 6501 used Python pulp for an optimization homework, and I was able to merge both learnings using `reticulate` and `rpy2`. Also, as 6501 backed off the coding and entered the \"case study\" phase, 6040 entered the \"application to models\" phase, implementing models that I learned in the beginning of 6501.\n I really enjoyed this class, not only because of the gradual learning curve, but also because the assignments were real-world applications of what you were learning.\n\nThe class applied a \"learn by doing\" philosophy to it that worked well with programming. Your homework assignments occur within a Jupyter Notebook that has test cells that determine whether or not you completed the exercise correctly. Having an issue with something? Then just copy the test cell data into a new cell and use that to debug you code. The set-up of the homework made it feel like they wanted you to succeed and were giving you the framework to do so. I wouldn't take it without some background in code, though - you need to have a foundation that this class builds on.\n\nThe part that challenged me the most was the last few weeks when we dove into the deep end with linear algebra. For someone who does pretty well with math but has never taken a linear algebra course (and thought it was a good idea to skip it...which wasn't in fact a good idea), I got to the point where I was able to complete the assignments, but I'm still a little hazy as to the WHY behind what I was coding. So, I'll be taking the Udacity Linear Algebra refresher suggested by another reviewer.\n\nThe midterms/final were discussed by other reviewers for I won't hash them out. I'll just say that once they got the format figured out (24 hours to complete, open everything), they weren't too bad. It's a challenge for sure, but they were doable. Agree with most reviews so far. Better if you have some python experience and linear algebra refresher before you start. That said it does build up slowly on the coding side. It got very intense for me the last 4-5 weeks through the final trying to follow math (mostly linear algebra) I should have known once upon a time but probably didn't learn properly and would have now forgotten at any rate. Completing it and mostly following the math was very satisfying.\nThat said, the homework was reasonably easy to do without following the math, it was laid out step by step with the final destination not necessarily well in focus; I would actually have liked a bit less hand holding along the way (it was pretty much routine to get 100 on homework). \n24 hour exam format was a winner, it gave those of us who don't code for a living a chance to demonstrate what we had learned. The final question on the final exam was great; I wish there'd been a couple more like that along the way. Others in this thread have mostly said everything there is to say. A quick summary of my experience:\n\nGood\n- Multiple Submissions: So good for learning. I was more willing to try things without help knowing that if I couldn't figure it out alone I could get help online later.\n- Can work ahead: So important for an online class for people with full-time jobs. \n- Midterm 1 and Final: Both were definitely challenging, but if you put in the work, it was certainly possible to get a 100%.\n\nOK: \n- Lectures: Sometimes didn't go into enough detail for me. But overall, the lectures combined with supplementary googling usually had me in a comfortable place with the material. \n\nBad: \n- Midterm 2: The drama surrounding this is well known. We had a 24-hour time limit, and many (if not most) required the enitrety of that time. I took 18 hours straight including coding from sunset to sun up to finish with an 84%. I think this was a miscalculation by the staff, and I think they learned from the experience and it probably won't happen again.\n\nMy Background: \n- 22 years old, soon to be married, graduated undergrad in May 2017.\n- Coding Experience: Minimal (light experience with non-Python coding languages)\n- Statistics Experience: Moderate (4 undergrad level stat courses)\n- Math Experience: Moderate (peaked at 2nd year Calculus) Challenging but not unreasonable expectations. This is class is only difficult due to the insane exams.  If you come into this class with some experience programming in Python the homework assignments should be pretty easy. The video are well done but many of them are just walkthroughs of your homework assignment that week.  The exams are insane.  For the two mid terms you are given 24 hours to complete the exam.  However, unless you are a very experienced programmer, you can expect to spend between 12 and 15 hours of work to complete each mid term (based on the results of slack polls).    Again, if you are python pro, you'll finish the exams in like 6 hours, but if you're not, plan on clearing your schedule for 24 hours because you will most likely need the time.  The mid term was also like this although we were given 36 hours to complete the exam instead of 24.  An improvement to be sure but still a very stressful and intense 36 hours.  To give some perspective, someone pointed out in Slack, 18 hours is the length of the California Bar Exam administered over 3 days.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that you'll spend that much time on each exams over one 24 hours period.      Great class, I loved it! I don\u2019t have a programming background, so although I had taken GT\u2019s Python Introduction (1301) and Introduction to Modelling (6501) before, this course was a challenge. I spent an average of 15 hours per week over the 15 week period on this course (including time spent on the exams, which is significant). Grading is very straightforward, with a graded homework assignment almost every week (13 in total); these count for 3-4% each, or 50% in total. The homeworks are beginner friendly, because you have an unlimited number of submissions. Midterm 1 counts 10%, Midterm 2 15%, and 25% for the Final. This term MT2 was the most challenging of all. They gave us a 24h window for MT1 and MT2, and even 36 hours for the Final; if you are a slow coder, you will use most of these time windows. After some negative feedback for MT2, my impression was that the Final was slightly easier. \n\nSo this course was hard, but I had a tremendous learning curve, I am amazed by all the stuff I know how to do with Python now, and I feel well prepared for the coming CS classes in this programme. I'm sad it's over!     Like others have said the difficulty of this class is highly dependent on your previous Python experience. I've programmed in Python for several years, so I was able to complete the programming assignments with little strain. However, even with my previous experience I still found valuable kernels of insight in this thoughtfully prepared course. You can tell professor Vudoc has a passion for the material and a careful approach to the pedagogy of teaching a mixed-level, program-required class. If there is one criticism I share with the other respondents it's that the class seems a little rushed just when it starts to get really good towards the end. If the early material could be compacted a bit and the later material expanded I think this class would be a must-attend, even for those more experienced with CS. However, I understand the need to accommodate those who are not as far along on their analytics journey, so I don't hold it against the staff. Good intro to Analytics concepts. Make sure you know Python going into the class, and it'll be VERY easy. I think the class is fairly difficult if you're trying to learn Python along with the class concepts, though. \n\nVery forgiving grading structure as well.   I really enjoyed this class. At first it didn't seem clear what level of linear algebra we'd need to be successful in the course\u2014as someone who hadn't studied matrix manipulation in about 20 years, I was apprehensive. But the ramp-up was gradual, and they did a good job of explaining sophisticated concepts while providing surface-level challenges.\n\nI started the class having just taken CS1301x, also available on edX. I highly recommend students take this course (or similar) before embarking on CSE6040. I also took the GA Tech linear algebra primer on Udacity. I feel like I would have been playing an exhausting game of catch-up if I hadn't. If you don't have Python experience, get some before enrolling.\n\nI found the challenge balance very satisfying. It definitely broadened and stretched my understanding of the math side of data manipulation. There were times when I thought I was finally in hopelessly over my head, but a bit of research or just plain staring at the code eventually led to (very satisfying) breakthroughs.\n\nI appreciate how responsive the instructor was to changing the test format from two proctored hours to 24 unproctored. It much better measured our ability and concept absorption\u2014and was also confiding to know the staff were listening to our concerns in real time. That's a big deal in an online course. BLUF: This course is intro to Python and it goes really well with ISYE 6501. \n\nMy biggest qualm with the course was the length of the midterms. For my class, our 2 midterms each took an average of upwards of 15 hours (we got 24 hours, but it was still quite absurd). Surprisingly, the final only took me 6, even though we got 36 hours to complete it. The exams and homeworks were open book/note with no online proctoring. The only restriction was that we couldn't ask our classmates for help, so I must say that despite my complaint, I can't really say anything was unfair. \n\nI took the course together with ISYE 6501 (Introduction to analytics modeling) and it was kind of neat because we would code up a lot of the algorithms discussed in the modeling course. \n\nThis course is comprised of lectures and Jupyter notebooks. Lectures are well designed as well as homeworks (You get 1 per week and each one took me a few hours to complete with the tv running in the background, nothing crazy). As far as autograders go, I've had much worse experiences than the one in this course. Learning to debug is extremely important, and you will certainly gain some experience in this course. \n\nIn terms of course content, this is what I imagine is taught at the Python 101 level,  with a sprinkle of harder topics. Many of the weeks went something like: \"Here is an analytics technique/algorithm. Code it in Python. Python already has a built-in function for it, this is how that call goes...\" This is actually a pretty good way to learn, because you essentially teach yourself the way that some of Python's functions work by coding them manually thus giving yourself a good introduction to Python, programming in general and the analytics models.", 
    "CSE-6220": " For me this course was very challenging - more so than both 6505 and 6210. \n\nThe concepts are really difficult to grasp and the exams proved to really kick my butt every time. \n\nThe concepts for the labs seem pretty straight forward but the implementations often proved very challenging - expect 20+ hours on each lab. \n\nThat being said - the course contents were really fascinating and, while demanding, this course will definitely strengthen algorithm analysis and distributed computing knowledge. \n\nC / C++ knowledge definitely a requisite for completing labs properly.  TL;DR: This is a fascinating class, but seriously consider taking it by itself. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Fascinating topics (OpenMP, MPI, caching)\n-Dr. Vuduc keeps the lectures lighthearted and interesting. \n-You get 2 \"48 hour\" late passes to turn projects in late with full credit. \n-You get a \"48 hour make your performance better\" period if you don't like where your grade is after they're released. This only applies if you actually turned something in though. They take the top result, so you don't need to worry about your grade going down. \n-The Piazza forum is active (with both the TAs and Dr. Vuduc replying). \n-Grading is fair. \n\nTHE BAD:\n-The projects take a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. Even with a very good knowledge of C/C++ I found that I was still spending 30-40+ hours on each project (except for lab0). Heed what others are saying. Do *not* wait till the weekend they're due. \n-The Udacity \"autograder\" can be a complete pain in the behind. At times the output isn't very helpful on why it failed. On top of that, the TAs generally don't expound upon what the grader is actually testing. Depending on the project, you can spend a significant amount of time just passing the autograder. \n-The projects have *roughly* a two week cadence. So you're always going to be working on something for this class (circle back to comment in the TL;DR). \n-Office hours aren't consistent. We'll have one every week and then nothing for 2-3 weeks. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe class averaged 23. 8/50 on the midterm and it was curved to being out of 40. While they didn't have to curve at all; this meant the majority of the class got a D or lower on the exam. Some of us were disappointed that last semester the average was 19/50 and it was curved to out of 30. To be fair though, two people got above 40 which is what likely \"broke\" the curve. \n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS:\n-Have a good working knowledge of C/C++. Especially pointers. \n-Go to (or watch) the office hours. \n-Give the class the time it needs.  This course is a fun ride through High Performance Computing. I didn't expect to love the class as much as I did, but seeing how to push computers to their limits in several different ways proved to be an exhilarating learning experience. The class is broken up into 3 sections: the Dynamic Multithreading Model, the Message Passing Model, and Cache-Optimized Algorithms. To do well in this course, I found it necessary to do most of the extra readings, and it was also helpful to go through the video lectures multiple times. If you put in the work for this course, you should do well, and you'll be rewarded by a wonderful understanding of the HPC landscape. My only wish for this course is that it was broken up into multiple courses so that I could dive deeper into each topic. This course is \"Intro to Parallel Computing\". This will teach you the primitives for parallel computing. I learnt and enjoyed the programming assignment. \nThe exams are on tougher side, but it will be a fun.\nThis course will teach you so many tools that can be used to analyze the parallel algorithm , and also cache friendly code. This a challenging, but very rewarding class -- maybe the best in OMSCS.  The course material is excellent and well-organized and the projects do a good job of reinforcing the material.  For example, we implemented MPI collectives using only send and receive operations in one lab, so that you really understood what they did before you started using them as black boxes.\n\nGetting a correct implementation of an algorithm (which isn't trivial) will get you 80 to 90 percent of the project points usually and then it takes some significant fine-tuning and experimentation to get the rest.  The test are very hard, but the problems are well-stated, unlike some other classes where the tests are hard because of ambiguity.  The TAs give generous partial credit and the Prof Vuduc gives a generous curve on top of that.  Note, however, that you're being curved against some very smart classmates due HPC's reputation as a difficult class, the fact it's not required for any specialization, and the substantial drop rate.  I would strongly recommend taking CCA or GA before this class and you need to be decent with C (taking GIOS would certainly be enough prep). Very difficult class, but very rewarding. \n\nThis was my first OMSCS class and I was afraid that it would be too much to handle right off the bat, but while it was very difficult I definitely learned a lot. Professor Vuduc and the TAs were very active and helpful on Piazza, and the lecture videos are put together very well. \n\nThere is a lot of reading between assigned chapters in the text book, assigned papers, and the papers necessary to learn about how to do the labs. Speaking of, the labs can be very difficult to get working fast enough, and I would highly recommend starting them as early as possible. They are all in C/C++, so brush up on that before the class starts. \n\nOverall it was a very informative course and the helpful Prof/TAs made my first OMS course feel less disconnected.  I usually don't write reviews for course, but felt that I should for this one. I have to admit this was the first time I struggled in a course, and have been very mixed on what to write. If you have any significant milestones in life or at work during the semester you intend to take this course, then I don't recommend this class to you. If you are have a lot of free time available then proceed.\n\nIt was definitely the most difficult course I have ever taken. I did think the material was very useful, and came out better for having made it through. The assignments were pretty cool, and required a significant time to complete. Only complaint was that it was never clear what made the best/fastest approach. It would have been nice to see what others did to get better performance.\n\nThe exams were absolutely insane, and not in a good way. Like other reviews said it is about taking what you learned to the next level. Given an entire weekend you might be able to solve all problems given, but in two hours just try to maximize the points you can get. The only real saving grace to the exams are a significant curve. My first class in the program was CS-6505, and those exams were easy compared to this class. This class is both interesting and fun. The lectures aren't too long. So it is fairly easy to keep up. \n\nNot to be confused with High-Performance Computer Architecture.. this class is all about Parallel Algorithms and how to program Super-Computers. You learn the Work/Span model and how to evaluate algorithms for Parallel Computers. You develop Parallel programs and you learn how to use new primitives to solve problems in a parallel manner. You learn how to program with both the Shared Memory and Distributed Memory architectures. There also seems to be a part about Cache Oblivious algorithms at the end (though we haven't gotten to that yet). \n\nOn the negative side though, there are topics that should be covered in lectures but aren't so you'll have to learn them on your own from arcane papers. The course organization could be improved a bit so that we aren't jumping from topic to topic. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with the subject matter then it will take some iterations to understand it. I went through the lectures 3x. \n\nThe labs require a LOT of time. Best start them early. The code is in C and C++ with OpenMP and OpenMPI. The main issue is just getting the code to work in the first place so you can then plan with the parallel part. \n\nThe TAs seem inexperienced and are mostly absent unfortunately. The professor is very engaged and answers a lot of questions on Piazza. The lectures are fun and funny to watch. \n\nIts highly doubtful I'll get an A in this class and a B will only be possible if I improve (I've gotten an A in every other class I've taken in the program).  Lab (Programming) assignments are too intense and difficult in functional implementation itself; thus taking most time in making it work instead of making it faster.  Agree with most of the reviews here. This is one of the best courses available. It's really hard but equally rewarding as long you can stay up to the end (I think only 36 of ~80 or so who started remained till the end). The labs are challenging & exams can be brutal (depending on where you stand under the overall distribution). \nProf. Vuduc & all the TA's are very good in what they do. They are almost always available on piazza, we had office hours almost every other week etc. Prof. Vuduc is not only good at HPC but has a very good sense of humor which he mixes well in between the lectures. That kind of lightens up the sometimes heavy content. Overall the video lectures are super excellent & worth while revisiting them when needed. \nIf you are willing to work hard & learn a lot, this is a course you shouldn't miss. I would highly recommend this course.  One of the best course I have taken in OMSCS (having taken ML, CV and RL). \nLectures are fun, HWs are intense, exams show you what your actual understanding of the subject is. If there was a follow up to this course, I would have taken it hook line and sinker. \nTips: \n1) Know your pointers (need not be an expert though)\n2) Leave sufficient time for the projects. \n3) Don't get discouraged, if you work hard you would definitely get to the other side smarter and funnier. \n\nRecommendation:\nJust take it !!! (if you love coding, algorithms and want bragging rights !!!) Intro to HPC has been the best class I've taken in the OMSCS. It blew my mind. Everything about it was awesome. \n\nThe projects were crazy-engaging. It was kind of a competition: the teaching staff often posted the top 5 performers among the submitted projects, with metrics and whatnot, so I got to try my very bestest to make it to that list. It was madness! (good madness)\nEach project illustrated a very advanced element of HPC, so I left with a feeling of having learned a lot. \n\nProf. Vuduc has a very particular sense of humor, which he embedded in his videos. It surprised me how I never got fed up with the jokes. I guess I always find a true nerd's humor amusing. \n\nI'd like to invite everyone to give HPC a chance. The fact that it's not required for a specialization (anymore :'S) shouldn't mean it's not worth the effort. This class is the bomb! It's packed with algorithm design and analysis (and very clever algorithms, by the way), several models of computation that you may not have studied before, and probably should, oh and the projects are spectacular. If you like algorithms, programming, getting your mind blown, and are up for a challenge, this class is for you. It's hands-on Computer Science in my opinion. \n\nThere are some requirements that I'll try and emphasize here:\n - Running time and complexity analysis, Big O and Theta notation, the master method, etc. \n - C and C++. You gotta know how to code in these languages. I mean know them well. If you're afraid of pointers, you should get some practice first. \n - Basic Linux command line knowledge, as projects involve a virtual machine and the Deepthought Cluster. \n - Some linear algebra, as in virtually any other class. \n - C and C++. Yes, you need to be able to get an algorithm from a lecture or an academic paper down to functional C/C++ code. \n - Debugging in the woods with your teeth and a knife. \n\nGive it a shot, You'll have fun! This has probably been my favorite course in the OMSCS program (and I'm almost done). I'm glad I was able to take it. The lectures are great, they have a great balance of humor and content. My only criticism would be that there needs to be more of them. \n\nThe labs can be challenging. You should have some C experience going into this course if you want to do well on the labs. Some are pretty straightforward but are still time consuming (and difficult to debug since you're running in OpenMP and MPI). \n\nExams are hard, really hard. They're open book, open notes, open internet and still the average score on the midterm was 50% (although the curve was generous). Make sure to hand write some of your own notes when reviewing lectures and practice exams to help reenforce knowledge for the exams. \n\nI highly recommend this course, and hope you make it to the other side *air guitar riff* of hell! This class is really hard for a first class. If it has been a while since you were in a hard class you might want to wait till you have some other graduate courses under your belt. Labs where _VERY_ time consuming and took me over 50+ hours to complete. One lab took me over 130 hours to complete. \n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n1) If you are not proficient at C don't take this class\n2) If you don't know how to use GDB or Valgrind don't take this class\n3) If you don't have massive amounts of time to spare,.... you guessed it, don't take this class\n4) If you want to learn a lot and can satisfy the first 3 parts _DO_ take this course! This course is a great course for mid to late program students. The lecture videos are very well done and entertaining, getting the core lessons across in a digestible manner. Topics are split across different areas with technical names which I would summarize as local parallelization (OpenMP), remote parallelization (OpenMPI), and cache stuff.\n\nProjects are uniquely challenging in that correctly implementing code (IE successful sorting) will only get you partial credit - full credit requires performance goals (Either completion under a certain time or number of cache misses). I previously took IOS/AOS so I thought that would give me a leg up for projects but I still found myself scrambling to complete projects. I ended up getting full credit for all projects but it cost me - I spent ALL my free time writing code and reimplementing methods to try to get better scores.\n** MY MAJOR COMPLAINT - Though I scored full marks, other people got crazy performance gains as compared to my implementations. While the lectures and papers leading up to projects give hints as to methods to use, there aren't any official recaps to let you know what you should have done.\n\nExams are very difficult. I am not entirely sure the motivating philosophy behind them, but I suspect the goal is to \"elevate\" your understanding of course material. What I mean by this is that the questions ask you to provide algorithms/psuedocode for problems you have not seen before. When I took Advanced Operating Systems I shut myself in my room for two weeks to study material and came out with 90s - for this class I did the same and scored raw 40/50 on the exams. Curves bumped me up to passing grades but it does make me wonder what the exact point is of making things so difficult.\n\nStill, it was a fun class. The TAs are great, Professor Vuduk is great, and you will learn a lot if you put in the effort. This class is definitely one of the best classes I've taken (both in this program and overall). \n\nThe class is very rewarding, and Prof. Vuduc's way of explaining/presenting things is just awesome. However, be aware of:\n- Assignments: they are really hard and require time\n- You need to know both C and C++ (one of the assignments is in C++, and it is not a trivial program to code)\n- Exams are really hard, and there only a few people getting 90%+ on them\n\nAll that being said, don't get discouraged, as this is a very good course, and your grade most probably will be quite good.  HPC is pretty cool. As an oversimplification: this class is about making algorithms as fast/performant as possible. The programming assignments are graded on how fast they run on a high-performance computing cluster. The course material covers parallelization on a shared memory system, distributed computing, and cache performance, and I felt like the class provided a good general intro to these topics.\n\nDr. Vuduc is clearly a passionate educator. He's good at illustrating many of the difficult HPC concepts. The lecture videos have high production quality. The class was well organized and the Piazza/Slack interactions were engaging.\n\nCSE 6220 was my first OMSCS course. I knew it was going to be challenging, but it was harder than I'd hoped. I found the midterm and final to be difficult and grueling. The exams are mostly theoretical / analytical while the labs are obviously practical. There seemed to be a disconnect between these two components of the course. The harder labs took a large amount of time, and I'm not sure how much additional time/energy would have been required to do really well on the exams. That said, if you do well on the labs, you can still get an A even with middling performance on the exams.\n\nI took this course to fulfill a foundational requirement, to challenge myself, and to get exposure to HPC. I came into the class with some light experience in C. I had to spend a lot of time on the labs wrestling with C issues that a more experienced C programmer wouldn't have. I also didn't have strong algorithmic analysis background, which made it difficult to follow some of the analysis portions. Overall it was a hard but good course. I feel accomplished after having completed it. I entered this course with lots of hopes & excitement & reading good reviews about it here. But unfortunately, I ended up being disappointed - which was in part due to my own undoing & in part due to my expectation of this course.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Prof. Vuduc has a good sense of humor!\n2. Some parts are interesting, How do you parallelize a seemingly serial algorithm. I liked Unit 1 especially.\n3. Initial labs were really interesting. (Basically lab1 & lab2, lab3 was okay).\n4. Generous marking.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. It's a time sink. The lectures only give you really basic intro - with hundreds of external references, which you may have to read to actually understand the material.\n2. Not much interaction with Prof. Vuduc. The course was mostly driven by TAs.\n3. More theory oriented than needs to be & heavily tilted towards MPI scheme of things (which is really niche).\n4. No mention of CUDA & related stuff. Not even basic NUMA which are becoming commonplace. So this course has limited practical utility.\n\nMisc:\n1. The last 2 labs were about Terasort & Funnelsort. Really ? I came to this course for learning parallel algorithms, not yet another sorting algorithm.\nAnd don't get me started on Deepthought :-(\n2. OpenMPI is really niche, and unless you work in an area that uses it, no point banging your head for it.\n3. Finally, I came to this course reading all the good reviews, but IMHO this course is highly overrated. \nYou should look up the actual course material on udacity to decide on whether you want to take this. This is a very interesting, but very difficult course. \n\nThe lectures are great, the discussions on Piazza are great, the interaction with Professor Vuduc and the TAs is great. \n\nThe midterm and the final kind of sucked ( i. e. they're just really hard ;) ). The approach that the class takes on exams is to get you to take your knowledge to the next level, rather than testing what you learned directly. This could be a good thing or a bad thing; depends on how you look at it. \n\nThe assignments are okay. Their goals are really exciting (parallel list ranking, the N-Body problem, distributed communication collectives, TeraSort, and funnel-sort), but I thought the instructions were a bit lacking. I'd say I spent 40% of my time trying to understand the skeleton code, another 40% learning about the goal of the assignment, 15% coding, and 5% learning things about C. \n\nWhile working on the assignments I found myself more stressed out and frustrated than focusing on putting my knowledge into practice. However, they're continually improving this course, so I anticipate that this will change in the near future. \n\nI do feel quite accomplished after finishing the course, and for what it's worth I took this as my first course while working full time, plus my wife and I had just had our first baby a couple of months before the class started, and I was able to pull off an A. So if you're up for the challenge, then I say go for it, you're learn some really cool stuff. I found this class to be extremely challenging, but very rewarding. I took it my first semester in the OMS program, which was definitely a mistake! I'm coming from a non Computer Science (but still engineering) background, and I had almost no experience with C/C++. I ended up spending between 20-30 hours a week on the course lectures, readings, and assignments, and ended up with a 'B'. That being said, I learned a ton. Prof. Vuduc is an amazing professor, and I found the concepts fascinating. If you're not coming from a CS background, I would strongly recommend doing some prep work on C and parallel algorithms. And be prepared to spend a lot of time debugging and getting your code to run. In the end, I loved this class, but wish I had not taken it my first semester. This is one of the most challenging classes in OMSCS, but crazy fun at the same time. Some algorithms such as Z-order curve will blow your mind. \n\nThe class has video lectures, reading text-books/publications and assignments. The Prof gives guidance on what to do each week, and you must follow that schedule if you want to do well in class. Office hours are held every week, and you must make full use of it. \n\nThere are 5 assignments, all of which are not at easy, even for the experienced C/C++ developer. You develop your project on a VM provided by the class, and then test it on an IBM super-computer, for which you are given access. An initial performance benchmark is provided for most of the assignments and your grading depends on the performance metric. Its better to start the assignments as soon as they are released. After submission, each assignment gets a 48-hour window to improve performance. The class is set up for student to succeed !!\n\nExams are open-book, open-internet, but none of that is of any use if you don't master the subjects. They release previous semester papers, and you should refer to it while reading the class material / lectures. I dropped this class but figured people considering it could use all the reviews they can get right now. \n\nThere's a disconnect between the lectures and labs in that the lectures are pretty short, not too dense, very entertaining, but don't cover what you need to know for the labs. There is a lot of studying of outside sources, not just the recommended readings, but whatever you can find on the algorithms you need to implement. They're not at all easy and you get very little credit for implementing them correctly. You'll spend a great deal of time just getting correct code, but you're graded mostly on performance, so keep that in mind. You need to pass the Udacity grader early, so you have plenty of time left to optimize and test your performance on the cluster. \n\nYou absolutely need to already know C, C++, and ideally at least a little about how OpenMP and OpenMPI work, or it's just going to get worse trying to learn that as you go. Know how to use common debugging and program analysis tools as well, gdb, valgrind, etc. You'll spend most of your time debugging early on when you're just trying to make sure the code works. \n\nFinally, know that it's not at all impossible to do well. I had trouble and had to drop because I was taking two other classes at the same time (including ML, which has very in-depth assignments) and was going through personal difficulties and just didn't have the time for it. If I had the time, I'm sure I'd have done fine. Just don't take the class lightly. You need to get an early start on every lab, do all the readings plus whatever other readings you can find, and get your code working early. I wish I'd known ahead of time we'd get almost nothing for correctness and be graded mostly on performance, which I guess makes sense in retrospect, but just wasn't what I was expecting based on all the other courses I've taken.  Very interesting topics. The videos are a hoot. Challenging labs (homework) that you definitely don't want to wait until the last minute for. There is (as mentioned) a lot of outside reading -- papers etc. If you're expecting everything to be in a big textbook, then you will be surprised. \nI took this as my first OMSCS course. Fortunately, I'm comfortable with C/C++. Those that aren't are getting killed understanding how pointers work, etc. Know your C first, and you will enjoy this challenging course. Don't know your C and you will definitely learn it the hard way.  Lectures are definitely the best part as Vuduc is very entertaining and and clear. The mandatory readings aren't too bad though the recommended ones can get a bit dense (thankfully skimming those seems to be sufficient). Professor is fantastic! TAs are OK\n\nThe real issue is the labs! So far, they've all required extensive outside reading, which is fine and expected in a graduate level course. The problem is the amount of time required and the lack of transparency in the grading. I had never not completed a CS assignment before (high school, undergrad) but I just could not get one of the labs working, even after 40 hours. There is effectively little credit for completion and none for effort though the target performance is usually doable if you've gotten that far. Just keep in mind that, even if you sink many hours into a lab, if you don't get it working, you will fail\n\nThe midterm was very challenging, with a median grade of ~40%, but there was a +40% curve added which made it more reasonable. \n\nFinally, if you are not comfortable with C/C++, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. There is way too much pointer manipulation involved for the uninitiated I know a lot of people are writing that this course is very time-consuming and challenging, but I found that it is also extremely forgiving and, as everyone agrees, incredibly worthwhile. I work full-time and took this course along with Network Security. I pulled one allnighter for this course because I am a champion at procrastinating, and even then, I could have just used one of the two 48-hour late day passes everyone is given. I even bombed one of the first assignments and ended up with a 97% in the class with all the extra credit they give out towards the end.\n\nI test much better than my actual understanding, so I found the tests fun and engaging and both the midterm and final had a generous curve (60%->90% and 76%->100% in my case). I would recommend going over the textbook somewhat thoroughly, or at least know where the relevant sections are, since on both tests, I managed to basically transfer pseudocode from the book onto the test for an entire question. Also have the solution manual to the book handy (there's a bunch of pdfs online). On the midterm, one of the questions was almost identical to the last year's midterm solutions. \n\nIf you're worried about taking this class, just take it and stay engaged on Slack and Piazza. Since it's usually a smaller class, all the students are very helpful and the professor and TAs were phenomenal. I started some projects 2-3 days before they were due (spending about 4-7 hours a day on it) and did fine by utilizing other people's questions and answers on Piazza and Slack. I don't recommend that because every single time, I would start an assignment and panic that I wouldn't crack the algorithm in time, but you should not panic if life gets ahead of you a bit and you neglect this class for a week or two.  Projects need to start as early as possible, don't overestimate yourself, almost every people in this class need at least 3-4 days to figure out one project, especially Lab2, Lab4 and Lab5 for me. But overall, compare with exams, projects are much easier. My average score for projects is 100.1 with some extra points, but the midterm only got 72, hope final exam would be greater than 70...   \n\nUpdate: final is 78, with 20 curve points. Although the exam is really tough, the score is not that bad due to the curve points. Overall, great course! I definitely learned a lot! ToDo Took this as my first OMSCS course (along with another, much easier class) so I'm not sure if my 'Overall difficulty' field is accurate. I am somewhat experienced with C/C++ which has been good enough that I didn't need to look up syntax and such, but I am really missing the Eclipse debugger for Java (I am a Java developer at work), since debugging multi-process code doesn't do so well with anything other than printfs and even then the output is kind of hard to parse. The projects are definitely difficult as I spend most of my time just trying to get the algorithm working without consideration for efficiency, but so far I have done well. I would definitely recommend this class if you have enough time and know how pointers work. Lectures were great, if this class wasn't online I probably wouldn't be doing near as well, I usually listen to the lectures 2-3 times before fully understanding what is going on.  Interesting lectures, great instructor. Challenging Lab assignments (there are 5 total). Need to know C/C++ programming. Not a lot of TA handholding. Facinating topics.  A tough but very good course! The lectures are good, if a bit too simplistic at times. The exams are very hard (for the given time) but completely open book. The real challenge are perhaps the assignments, which do need a good grasp of C, pointers, pointer arithmetic and recursion. Overall, a great course, though my word might be biased since it was my first into the program, This was one of my first two courses, and with no prior experience with HPC, I found it very difficult. The course requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and of course, expertise in C along with debugging. Instructors and material are awesome and the course is very well designed.\n\nA piece of advice: might not be a very good idea to take this course in first semester along with any other course!\n\nOverall, I loved this course and learned a lot! This class is definitely a challenge. But it's a challenge for all the right reasons. The lectures are well presented and you'll certainly learn a ton. The assignments can be very challenging and count for a large percentage of your grade. In fact if you do well in the assignments you can still do well in this course despite the extremely difficult midterm and finals. \nGoing into this course, I'd make sure you take the prerequisites seriously. Know you algorithmic analysis. I found that I had to brush up on a few areas of maths during the course which didn't help under the heavy workload. Knowing some linear algebra is also helpful as 2 large sections of the course work with matrices. The assignments are mostly done in C, so make sure you're well versed with that. The level of C needed is (imho) about the same as that for AOS or similar courses. \n\nThe class is hard because achieving high performance is a difficult problem. If you do this class, you'll discover that even something simple like sorting which you may have mastered from undergrad now becomes an order of magnitude more complex and if you don't do it right you may have severely degraded performance even though you have N times more computing power. \n\nI highly recommend this class. Even if you're not solving a problem across many compute nodes, performance will always be important and this class will give you the right tools to write high performance software.  This course is both very challenging and interesting. The word \"introductory\" in the title can be quite misleading. When I took this course, I presumed that the course teaches OpenMP and MPI. It doesn't. You are required to study these as part of the course and use them in solving the assignments. The course focuses more on algorithms and divided into 3 parts:\n\n1. Shared memory parallelism (OpenMP)\n2. Distributed memory parallelism (MPI)\n3. Cache based optimizations\n\nLectures: The course content is very good, but may require multiple readings/viewings before it can be assimilated. This was my 5th course, and my toughest so far. The instructor is hilarious. His jokes are very creative and funny and perhaps compensate for the heavy lecture material. \n\nAssignments: There are a total of 5 assignments. Of these 3 are reasonable. 2 are very tough (There are students who spent more than 40-50 hrs on an assignment and still couldn't complete it). If you get an assignment to work you get about 80-90% credit. The remaining 10-20% goes for performance improvements. The problem is that if you don't get the assignment to work, you lose big time. And that can be harsh, because many students spend most of their time just getting it to work. Do not underestimate the assignments and start early. Also, you need to be comfortable with C, C++ (especially pointer handling). Without this you will struggle in implementing some assignments. \n\nMidterms/Final exam: These can be quite tough. The midterm had a class average of around 19/50. The final exam had a class average of about 29/50. You have to be really well versed in the course content to do well in the exams. \n\nGrading: I do not know the exact grade distribution but based on the numbers shown on this website, the percentage of A's seem to be the lowest among current courses while the number of C's seemed to be the highest compared to current courses. Not the course to take if you want to get away with an easy grade. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in knowing more about HPC algorithms and are willing to work hard.  This was my first course in the program, and I enjoyed the class and learned quite a bit about HPC programming.  The class is a lot of work, but the TAs are very helpful through Piazza and Slack.  Exams are challenging, but doable with a generous curve.  Definitely study:  review the assigned readings and lectures.  Exams used ProctorTrack but were open notes/book/internet.  The instructor (Prof Vuduc) was great, but only showed up for a couple of the office hour sessions.  I would have liked more interaction with him.\n\nA few things that I disliked:  it felt like there was a lack of feedback on graded work.  For the projects/labs, many times implementing algorithms as presented in class would not get you 100% on the lab (but you could still get an A or B fairly easily).  You need to be creative or research some methods to speed up your code (grades are based on run times).  After the grades were returned, there wasn't really much discussion on ways that people were able to get full credit, so I felt there was an opportunity for more learning that was missed.\n\nSome of the later projects had a few issues with cluster being temperamental - no fault of the teaching staff, but definitely frustrating for the students.  Our grades were based solely on run times, but we couldn't actually get accurate timings on some of the labs.\n\nFinally, the exams are notoriously difficult.  Midterm was 60 points, but only graded out of 50, and the prof recognized that no one would even get close to 60 points during grading.  An additional (generous) curve was added after grading was complete. Definitely a tough course but very fulfilling. Instructors/material are great and the course is a well designed one. My word of advice will be, can you code in C? To be able to write a ~250 lines of code in C with pointers and be able to use debugger is a must. I already had a fair amount of experience in HPC going into this class, so it didn't seem as hard as a lot of the reviews suggest. The one challenge was that 3 out of the 5 labs were in C; I have a lot of experience in C++, but none in C and there was definitely a bit of a learning curve. My recommendation for students is to start the labs early, check the piazza discussions daily, and try to squeeze every possible point out of the labs, particularly if there is any extra credit available. \n\nMy recommendation for the instructors (should they happen to read this) is that I found Unit 3 and lab 5 a bit esoteric and not particularly valuable. I would have preferred that Unit 2, which is on distributed memory systems, be expanded and include more challenging labs, possibly a Cartesian finite volume solver of some kind. \n\nOverall it was a fantastic course, and I definitely learned a lot. most of the lectures are well organized, but sometimes are hard to understand for me (with little CS background). Exams contains many details in the lectures and maybe similar but not the same kind of questions to the lecture quiz and sample quits. The two midterms for 2015 fall is hard and the mean is below 80, however the final is quite easy and most of the questions are the same in the two midterms. So my got an A at last... Such a surprise... \nIf you want to get an A without many hardwork, don't take this course. If you like chanllege yourself with a theoretical course, it is an interesting one to try. \n\nIf I read this unofficial suyvey before registering my first semester's classes, I wouldn't chanllege myself.... It was so hard and almost painful to me.  There's a few easy, wishy washy courses in the OMSCS program. This is definitely not one of them. This is probably one of the best classes I've ever taken in my life. \n\nThis class is hard. If you are not a competent c programmer with an understanding of basic algorithms you will probably not make it through this class. However, this class is also completely awesome. The lectures are incredibly well done and are interspersed with actual good humor by Prof. Vudoc. The projects are all very interesting. There are 5 of them and I've spent about 20 hours on each. I could have spent double that time optimizing them, but my efforts were good enough to get close to 95% on most. \n\nThe midterm was brutally hard. I have not taken the final yet but expect it will be the same. However, the grading structure is such that you can get a 50% on the midterm and final, yet still get an A or B in the class if you do excellent on the programming projects.", 
    "CSE-6242": " This was by far the worst class I have ever taken--online or in person. It was an easy A for me but I would rather have had the class be more challenging and actually learned more--I don't feel like I learned much beyond some very basic Machine Learning concepts. \n\nThe professor and most of the TAs were mostly absent from Piazza and it was like pulling teeth to get any sort of response from them. The instructions for the homework weren't clear and it was difficult to get anything clarified. The TAs would tell us something and then the homework would be graded the opposite of what they had told us. TAs and professor would contradict each other all the time. At the time of the final exam, I had only gotten back my grades for HW1 and HW2 (out of 3 homeworks, 2 projects, and some additional extra credit activities). This was frustrating since some of the questions on the final were related to things we did in the homework and projects, and when I wasn't sure if I had done those things correctly I thus wasn't sure how to answer the questions on the final correctly. \n\nI got high scores on the homework and projects but I have to wonder if it's just because there was such a backlog of grading to do close to the end of the semester that the TAs just rushed through it and gave almost everyone As. I'm guessing at least half of the class ended up with an A, especially due to the extra credit--it may have actually been closer to 75%. \n\nI was hoping to learn a lot about data visualization but it was mostly just a tutorial in how to use ggplot2 and a short discussion of the different types of plots one can create. The lectures were very shallow and general--I wish there had been more of them. It was probably only about 6 hours of lectures total for the entire class. It just felt like it wasn't enough, and it also felt like the professor (who was NOT the same professor as the one in the lectures) didn't really care about this class at all. \n\nDISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A good introduction course to R and simple machine learning analysis. With 5 extra credit, I think it's pretty easy to get an A which only requires a final grade of 90/105. A severe disappointment both in quality of instruction and content of instruction. The course contains less than half of the material taught by Prof G. Lebanon back on 2011 while he was teaching at Gatech. 1. R is intuitive & easy to learn if you have programming experience\n2. I got a B - thought I deserved A, missed by a whisker. The extra points of AC *will* help. Plan to get those\n3. Course content is fairly easy. Make sure you learn \"Regularization\" well - it is at the end of the course. The videos didn't cover it well, I felt. I should have learnt it from elsewhere. My course concentration at that time slipped a little (Life got in the way)\n4. Final exam was tough\n5. Don't expect too much from instructors. They were always MIA. TAs & fellow students on Slack and Piazza were very helpful. The content is very useful and applicable. And the professor made it easy to follow. The course is based on R and there will be an introduction to R in the beginning so no need to worry about the language. The grades are evenly distributed between 1/3 homeworks(4), 1/3 projects (2), 1/3 exam (1). The homework and projects are managable and relevant to the course content. Hwever, the final exam is brutal even though it is open book. Be prepared. Similar to how others feel this semester, I feel like this class didn't go very well. \n\nInconsistent communication between the TAs and instructor when clarifying assignments, slow grading, much less responsive on Piazza than the other class I've taken, small mistakes in the assignment instructions... \n\nI felt like the video material was OK (certainly better than the rest of the class), but there were still a lot of confusing parts, like quizzes that weren't sufficiently explained or that attempted to check free-form answers automatically. \n\nOverall I'm pretty disappointed in this class and I think it wasn't worth taking compared to other classes. That being said, I do find that some of what I learned, especially about visualization is quite useful and possibly relevant to my job. Final review: \nThe class only has 6 parts to it: R programming, Data Viz, Preprocessing Data, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Regularization. \nBy the second part of the class, and the class continues to be heavy on R syntax and light on actual concepts. \nThe part on Logistic Regression becomes a bit more concept oriented (and less R oriented). \nIn general workload is still very light, except the projects took an average of over 30 hours to complete (but there were 2-3 weeks to do it). So make sure you start work early. \nThe class features interviews from Netflix data scientists. That is interesting to watch. \nProfessor is active in Piazza. Good experience with Youtube Live office hours. \nThe class organization could be better, TAs don't make too much presence on piazza. \nI think the class could have taught a lot more, while its a good intro to Data science, the amount of content is a bit underwhelming. 12 lessons would have been better and still manageable. Very well managed class, interesting material for someone with no prior ML/Data science background. It was a great way to start the program When I took this class in Spring 2017 there were lots of issues with the way class was run. You will mostly find negative reviews for that term. Even with all the issues I did learn a lot from this class as it was my 1st ML class. I liked overall course content and enjoyed all projects/home works. This class will prepare you for a Data Analyst role and may even be a good starting place for a DS role.\nIf you are interested in learning R and using R for data analysis and visualization along with few ML concepts then this is the class for you. This was a fun class, with a few frustrating aspects. The class was pretty basic, with the exception of homework #3 which was very calculus heavy (which I have no experience with) and there wasn't much explanation for the math needed. For the rest of the class it was very easy, mostly just homework assignments where you had to shuffle data into different formats and then use libraries to display the data.\n\nOne frustrating aspect was that homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. They often took 3-6 weeks to be graded. Part of the problem was that several TAs had accidents or unplanned events happen and so other semesters of this class may not experience such a long delay.\n\nI also wish that there had been more helpful feedback on assignments, usually they just marked the number of points you missed with a short comment to what section was wrong, but the comments were usually very cryptic.\n\nDr. Joyner was very kind when you approached him with grading questions and there were several times when an assignment would be awarded points because there were several students that missed a single question or because something wasn't very clear.\n\nOn average I spent 7 hours and 48 minutes per week, but there were some weeks where I did a lot more than others and the range is from 1:20 to 16:41 (that was one of the project 2 weeks).\n\nI would recommend studying calculus (which is does mention on the course info page) before homework 3, but other than that this was a pretty easy class. This is a great class, and how classes should be structured. I agree with most of the other comments mentioned: workload is do-able (plan at least 12-15 hours a week, as the projects take far longer than you will anticipate), there is roughly 9 hours of video total, and the instructor is very active and very reasonable. \n\nThe only thing I will say differently is the math, at least for the last homework, was challenging for someone rusty in partial derivatives. Fortunately this part of the homework is the only homework / project that you actively need a math skillset; fortunately the instructor is very lenient on discussing the math section, to the point where a legendary student (who is also a math professor) walked the class through most of the problem and there was no complaint from the instructor. I will say brush up on Calculus (particularly derivatives, partial derivatives, and the chain rule), Probability, and basic Linear Algebra and you should be fine. Everyone should take DVA before Machine Learning to reduce the initial learning curve of ML. It's a great introduction to R and data analysis. There's some math involved as well, although not too complicated. The workload is moderate, light in the beginning, but picking up during later homework and the projects. The class is a good combination between practical and theoretic. I end up actually understanding regression and the math behind it and become quite proficient in R. It's such a bummer that the professor will not teach next semester. He is very involved with the class. Really great course. The TAs were active, helpful, and obviously worked hard. I felt bad when a student essentially posted that the TAs weren't worthy to grade his work without PHDs. Many other students appreciate your grading! \n\nThe first half was a lot of visualization and getting started with R, which was nice for me because I have never used it. The latter half was similar to ML class, not quite a subset but very similar topics. I'm sure I didn't do great on the final, but I won't let that change my review on the class overall. Contrary to what most people say, I think this course was very poorly managed. TAs impose and enforce policies at will sometimes just a few days before deadlines and once retroactively. Some of the TAs are excellent, but you don't know who's grading your work and whether they decide to create a new rule. I will definitely avoid any courses with Dr. Joyner in the future. I've only seen a few professors that are less ethical and with less skill in management.\n\nThat said, the material is great. They are still using Dr. Lebanon's videos and writings which have numerous typos and are unnecessarily esoteric. But you do learn a bit and nice introductory course. Good introduction to R. Videos at the beginning were good but later on lost its charm. Topics on ML could have been done better. The homeworks, projects and activities are very good. They test and improve our R skills. I ended up using a lot of online resources like Stackoverflow in dealing with different R syntax and libraries that can help do the homeworks and projects. The course teaches on how to visualize data, pre-process data (handle missing data), feature engineering and finally Linear and Logistic Regressions. Knowing some R libraries can really help speed up coding for the homeworks and projects. The visualization part of this course is also pretty good. They teach us about ggplots and other visualization techniques through activities (like graph networks and plotting data on world/country map) which are very powerful in creating visual charts with single line of code. I combined ML4T with this course and overall managed A in both. The 2 are a good combination. DVA exams are good , open book, open internet - second exam was special - very conceptual than memorizing. I didn't spend time outside watching the videos for exam preparation and still ended up doing well. Like other people commented, there were major operational issues in this class and I ended up spending a more hours than I hoped to make sure I interpreted the problems correctly. The majority of the frustration come from communication gap among instructors, TAs and students and unclear grading criteria without clear rubrics/expectation. The content seems reasonable and it could cover more visualization techniques in my opinion. Overall, it was disappointing that things did not work out well throughout the semester and hope there is major improvement planned by the next offering. \n\nIf you want to learn R and basics of linear and logistic regression techniques, it may be worth taking even. I'd taken this course seeing the highly positive reviews on this site for the previous semester offering. The Prof was changed for this semester and I found the course was very disorganized. Most of the students in the class seemed not so impressed. Hopefully changes will be made for the next semester. Prof. Joyner's presence has been helpful this semester. Apparently, one of the TAs dropped out, which has significantly slowed grading. Before they got behind on grading, the TAs and instructors were always available on Piazza. Now their presence is more like other OMSCS classes. There are lots of office hours available on slack. A few students expressed concerns about grading consistency with the first two homework assignments, but regrades are underway. The current construction has one homework that is machine learning heavy and that has been the source of the most complaints on Piazza. As with ML4T the topics are introduced in lecture, but possibly not in sufficient depth for someone without recent undergraduate background in CS theory and math (partial derivatives of vectors). Both ML4T and DVA include machine learning topics along with domain topics (pandas, stocks and R, visualization respectively). BTW, there is currently no mid-term, only homeworks, projects and a final. Overall, I'm glad I took DVA this semester. The semester is not over yet and I already managed to use some of my new skills at work. It seems I enrolled in this course at an unfortunate time, as the new instructor this semester didn't seem prepared to teach a MOOC (curious how different his on-campus performance was). Regardless, the lack of timely feedback and consistency of assignment clarification led to a lot of unnecessary confusion. I'm all for an appropriate level of confusion regarding course content, as that's called \"learning, \" but this semester was a logistical mess. Props to Adrian Chang, our TA who went above and beyond in grading, Piazza responsiveness, and overall engagement. Tough to do for 500 students, especially when the prof was frequently absent or seemingly unreachable. \n\nRegarding curriculum only (in hopes of logistical improvement for future course iterations): I don't come from a math background, and could have brushed up on calculus before enrolling. I thought this course would be more focused on visualization principles. There was some ggplot experimentation with project 1, but it's mostly about using basic ML models and R to analyze data. Glad to get a first taste of logistic & linear regression, but am pretty convinced I don't want to use R or ggplot ever again. The workload in this class was relatively light. There's only six lectures, very similar to the style of AI4R. The course is very heavy on R programming, and at least some form of statistical background will help you a lot in this class. Coming from a SAS-heavy background with no knowledge of R, I've appreciated the opportunity to get my hands into data manipulation and visualization using R. We also had the opportunity to learn the mechanics behind linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization. \n\nThere are 4 homeworks (technically 3, but the 3rd counts as double and is twice as long), all of which have been doable in a reasonable amount of time. The project this semester is divided into two parts, and is about analyzing and visualizing movie characteristics from IMDB's database to find the best predictors for gross revenue. I thought it was pretty neat to be given a real world problem with imperfect data to analyze. Don't procrastinate on the project. Unless you're really handy with R, it'll probably take 30-50 hours for each part (divided into two parts, due at different times). \n\nI really enjoy watching the lectures (sped up to 1. 5x), and the professor provides the lecture slides so you can actually just sit, comprehend, and follow the notes rather than screenshotting the video every two minutes. The professor is very active on Piazza, which makes up for the extreme lack of TA participation. Most of my time in this course is finding out how to make R do what I want it to. Grades are slow to be released, this semester's batch of TAs had a few that \"dropped the ball\". We have a second project due in two weeks, but have not received grades for the first. The assignments seem straightforward, but the grading can be harsh if not interpreted exactly like the TA expected. Verdict at this point is to skip this course until they tighten up some of the assignment specifications, and perhaps add more lecture content. This is a good course if you are looking for an Intro to R and to ML. The first half of the course is really basic R and most people will do well. There are projects and home works, but, I could not really tell the difference between the two. Course had 3 HWs (33. 5%), 2 projects (33. 5%) and one final exam (33. 5%). So the exam is a pretty big portion of the grade and is fully open ended. It tests your understanding of what is taught in the course. Overall, I would say this is a good course, but not an easy A if you are new to R or ML. \n\nFor those who are looking to take another course along with this one, it can be done. I took this one (DVA) and 6400 (DB-Systems-Concepts) and could manage the workload on both. Preliminary review, so that people choosing a course for next term, might have some information at hand. The instructor is very active on Piazza (not really sure if it's just because this is the first time offering). Office hours are bi-weekly held. Video lectures have been great so far, although there are only 6 hours of video for all the semester (with a lot of in-line quizzes, maybe that increases the amount of time dedicated to the lectures)\n\nThe course is completely R based, but don't be afraid, you learn it from scratch. I'd say this is a good course to pair with another one, it has a medium load. Also I think this would be a very nice introduction to ML topics. Basic calculus/probability concepts are needed for the second part of the course. \n\nHomework and projects feature open ended questions, where you explain/justify your answers (report) and also provide the R code you wrote to justify your analysis (tables, plots, etc). It's also helpful if you already have experience writing \"vectorized code\" (like in Matlab, Python with Numpy/Pandas, etc). \n\nSyllabus:\n\n- R programming (most of the course will be in R)\n- data visualization\n- data processing\n- logistic regression\n- linear regression\n- high dimensions and regularization\n \nEach one of those \"chapters\" is covered in two weeks, so typically in that lapse of time you watch the lectures and work on the homework/project associated with that chapter. \n\nGrading: \nThe course features three assignments, an individual project (divided in a midterm project, and final project), and a final (open book, not multiple choice) exam with the grade distributed equally between these components (33% all hw, 33% project, 33% exam). \" New professor this semester. Material is not so hard, but the requirements are vague and ambiguous. You lose points if you did not successfully interpret what they really want(which is the most difficult part of this course for me). \nDifferent TAs reply the same question with different answers. I guess they don't even align before answering questions. Some of them are arrogant. I still remember a TA answered students' clarification request on a homework requirement like 'there is no ambiguity here' even though more than 10 students asked the same question. \nupdates: so the professor showed up one week before the final on Piazza. I also heard some students filed official 'academy grievance ' and it seems administrators are on students' side. You know who is wrong now. I got an A, btw, which ensures this review is not a 'grievance'. Excellent class! I think Prof. Joyner changed couple of things and now is so much better.  You can work ahead if you want to and you learn a lot along the way. I've never worked with R but by the end of the class, I felt pretty confident using that language to analyze and visualize data. This class has an excellent ratio of Theory and Practice.\n\nAlso, because of the practical side of this class, I was able to get a job as a Junior Data Scientist!! \nSo, in short, you'll learn R, Data Analysis and Visualization, Intro to ML (Logistic and Linear Regression) and hands-on experience in case you want to look for jobs in Data Science. \n\n That's a 10 in my book, hehe. I am adding this in the middle of the term so that it is useful for students registering in Fall 2017. So far, we have completed 3 home-works and one projects. One more project and final exam is remaining. The course starts out easy, first homework is very easy [introduction to R concepts and programming], second homework is moderate [introduction to ggplot2 and data visualization techniques]. The first project was analyzing movies dataset. There were ten questions with lot of subdivisions and each was equivalent to one homework. The third homework is implementing logistic regression algorithm from scratch and optimizing the code so that it runs fast thus enabling to train and test on the dataset given. I am new to ML domain, and the lecture covered in the video was not at all enough to complete the homework, I had to watch the relevant portions in Andrew NG's course to gain the intuition behind logistic regression. It was hard work but at the end, I felt good implementing the algorithm and training it. \nThis course starts off as easy and by the time you realize that the course is taking all the free time you have, it is well past the drop deadline. I would strongly advise students with no experience in ML domain to take this course as a single course. If you want to double up, it can be paired only with courses which are front loaded like the AI4R course. I have put 18 hours per week but that is applicable only to the second half of the course.  This course is by far (as of Nov 2017) ranked the worst among all OMS courses, but I still want to leave my comment, because I'm shocked by the inconsistency of OMS standard after taking 4 great courses. I registered this course after reading the on campus syllabus (My bad), when I saw the OMS syllabus, it was too late to withdraw and waitlist another course, so I decide to take it. The on campus version included all modern technologies SQL, Tableau, D3, Hadoop, Azure, Hbase, Pagerank etc.. But the OMS version is basically week 1-6: intro to R and ggplot in R; week 7 till end: regressions in R. The syllabus speaks for itself, a more appropriate name should be \"intro to regression with R\" or \"the linear regression half of stat 101\". These knowledge might be useful 10 years ago when everything was analyzed in memory, but now... I'm almost to the end of this semester, I've completed most of the homework/project in slow Friday afternoons at work without watching the videos. I have a statistical background, but to be honest, the course (homework) covered nothing more than linear regression, I assume most of us coming to the program should have some knowledge of linear regression. \n\n The only scenarios I think you should take this class:\n 1. you need a low involvement course: eg. you are paring it with an intensive 30+ hour course.  \n 2. (more important) if you are in the Machine Learning specialization, you have to chose 3 electives from the 4 courses offered. If you have one course you don't want (eg. BD4H), you'll have to take all the rest of the 3.  First thing is to clarify that there are two versions of this class, I will talk about the OMSA version.\n\nI loved this class! I can say it is one of the best online courses I ever did. The instructor is very passionate and very knowledgeable and the assignments are challenging but you end up learning a lot.\n\nYou will learn a lot about D3, and some bits about modeling and Big data technologies, but you will get a good general picture of what a full data pipeline project looks like.\n\nThe presentations are very enjoyable and well crafted, and you will make some friends thanks to a group project that will require at least 4-5 meetings. \n\nAll this said, this course could be improved on some aspects, one of which is time management and a bit more of hand holding. So don't underestimate the amount of time you will need for it. There are 4 BIG homeworks, so don't procrastinate and work steadily, if you do that I estimate around 20hours per week.\n This course is deceptively easy. It starts out really slow learning R and plotting. Then as you get into the algorithms it picks up in speed so don't let the start fool you.. The first project is relatively easy since it is mostly just figuring out R libraries. Part 2 takes longer if you really try to apply everything including things that may not have been covered yet. Make sure you just plan accordingly and don't wait until the last moment for things. That is the only time you will really run into trouble. \n\nOverall, I thought this would give more industry experience given that Prof Lebanon has worked at a variety of large companies. I think I learned more from other students who were nice enough to post explanation than I did from the professor. I would also recommend getting The Elements of Statistical Learning as an alternate reference for this course since there is little reference material provided. Also, brush up on linear algebra and calculus before you get to logistic regression. This is my first course of OMSCS. I have no previous R programming experience, but I do have ML experience. \n\nIn this course, you will taught for following topics:\n\n1- R Programming Language  (Excellent part! All data scientist should learn a bit R)\n\n2- Data Visualization (This is part I love for this course, you will learn a lot of different visualization of data)\n\n3- Preprocessing Data (Also very good, it is very important to learn how to clean dirty data)\n\n4- Logistic Regression (Not good, they use too complicated terms to describe, even I have previous ML experience, I still couldn't understand these lectures)\n\n5- Linear Regression (Same as logistic regression)\n\n6- Regularization (Not bad, but it can be better) \n\nAgain, this course did excellent job in R and data visualization/preprocess, but I completely dislike the second half of this course. If you are going to be in ML specialization, take CV instead.  Worst out of the 9 other classes I've taken. Don't take this class until its fixed. It's all in R anyway. So that's a skill no one needs (Python exists). I guess if you really want to know how to make a graph using R while deciphering the worst instructions ever created for any assignment in the OMSCS program this might be the course for you. \n\nProf rarely participates. To quote Arpan Chakraborty (the Prof) \"The TA's have dropped the ball. \" What kind of Professor blames the TAs... I feel like Georgia Tech and Udacity pulled a fast one on this class. GaTech couldn't find a professor to teach so they made Arpana Chakraborty, a Udacity course developer/instructor as an adjunct lecturer to teach under the GaTech brand. In his own words, \"I apologize for being absent for the past couple of weeks; I've been busy with work outside of this class\", excuse me? He clearly does not take teaching nor this job seriously, nor concern about the success of the students. \nI have taken 4 classes, loved them all, but not this one. Arpana and few TAs (BTW, apparently we are all unworthy to TA Jiachen Yang) are clearly inexperienced and ill prepared. Awful communication skills, no rubric in assignments, students repeatedly complain having to read the TAs' minds but the staff so far provided no resolution regarding the issue. There are extra credit assignments that are worth 1 point each in final grade, but it's all 1 point or nothing, providing little or no incentive to complete the extra credits since they are poorly defined. TAs are poorly coordinate among themselves and routinely release contradicting information, which snowball into a sea of Piazza threads. No peer feedback, no exemplary work. Project 1 was due Mar 6, 2017, still haven't been graded as of April 4, 2017 due to some TAs dropped the ball. Not looking forward to the final exam which account for 30% of the grade. One big reason I join OMSCS was to avoid this kind of teaching. GaTech needs to evaluate the staff carefully to uphold and preserve the integrity of this program. I suggest the staff take the playbook from other courses like ML4T or CP or KBAI for future version of this course. The course material does not cover the homework assignments. The TA's are not helpful, they constantly tell you to refer to the reading even when you say that you don't understand the reading. The professor only sends weekly announcement. He does not answer questions on Piazza or Slack. This was the most horrible course I have taken in life EVER!\n\n* Very disorganized and chaotic. Contradictions among TAs. No grading rubrics. \n* TAs abandoned ship after 2 weeks and we never got any response for regrading requests. My question to the instruction is still open for HW1 and haven't received a response after 3 months. \n* Lectures were shallow while the projects/assignments expected in-depth knowledge. \n* If you know ML already, u won't learn anything beyond ggplot2 (plotting few graphs). If you don't you are going to be in hell that term. \n* Final exams had questions and concepts that weren't taught in the course. \n* I don't think I would have gotten an A without taking few external ML courses which added a huge burden to the time consuming projects that are there in this course. \n* Oh and if you by mistake looked at the course offered on-campus, that is no where related to this online course. So be ready to be surprised if you thought you are going to learn some cutting edge technologies to do real world big data analytics. This course is so 15 years behind with technologies and what is happening in the industry. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this course until it is revamped with new videos, content and properly organized. Interesting class which teaches students about real world and not just book knowledge. That being said, the class would be fairly easy for someone who already knows R programming language or has already taken machine learning class. I personally learned the concepts in class so i had to spend alot of extra hours to get use to it. The professor is very knowledgeable and was very active on piazza as well, but I felt I learned mainly from other students who were already in this field or were fairly knowledgable and contributed their knowledge on piazza. I took the OMSA class with Dr. Chau. This was by far the most challenging and time-consuming class I have ever taken (my undergrad was ME from Tech).  I also learned more in this class than any other class - a direct output of the fact that I spent more time on this class than ever before.\n\nDr. Chau is extremely reasonable and truly cares about his students. It is easy to get an A in this class as long as you spend the time. Generally you will be able to keep working/debugging code until you are certain that it is 100% correct. You have 3 weeks per HW assignment, which is reasonable as long as you start working immediately and don't procrastinate on the group project.\n\nMy only gripe about this class is that it should be worth 6 credit hours instead of 3. There is no way that the amount of content covered and work required for this class should be weighted the same as courses like ISYE 6501 and MGT 6754 which generally are in the 5-7 hours/week range. This class had so much potential, but I think the switch to a new professor with limited experience running an online class really limited the class. It suffered greatly from \"new class\" issues, and I think the large class size in combination with the new professor and long homeworks / projects overwhelmed the TA's. I agree with most of the other posts as it was a poorly run class. \nBut, in spite of all the negative points, I still managed to learn (mostly on my own) about the R language, regression analysis, and some data analytics. If you are the type of person that is willing to learn and investigate topics on your own, this might be the class for you. Otherwise I would suggest passing on this class until it is cleaned up. Took this as my first and only course in OMSCS for this semester and I would say this was a good choice in terms of work load and difficulty level as I'm working full time and it's been years since graduated from college. This course provided a refresh on calculus and linear algebra which I guess is useful when I get deeper in ML. I also took this course to learn R as a new language, which I think the course material did a good job on that, but maybe too much as it seems like it assumes minimum background in coding. So if you, like me, are a professional developer for years, you may find it boring.\n\nThe workload is light, only exception is the first project which you need to do some partial derivatives and implement a logistic regression model using R from scratch. The requirement wasn't clear until couple of days before the deadline, which makes it hard if you want to finish it early on you own pace. But since most of the HW and projects are due early Monday mornings, you have good chance to spend your weekend and should be able to get it done. I still remember the last project which is due the Monday after thanksgiving and I had to bring laptop with me and did some coding while on vacation in Fairebanks, Alaska. It was good memory though :)\n Joyner ran the class this semester so everything went smoothly and was well communicated. The class is pretty easy if you're familiar with R, otherwise it's about ML4T difficulty. Basically, take this class if you want to practice or learn R, or have absolutely no exposure to data science work (cleaning data, feature engineering, simple models). FWIW I didn't watch any of the lectures and still got an A. The exam was timed and proctored but open everything, including Google. To quote comic-guy from Simpson's: \"Worst. Class. Ever. \" The instructor for this term thought he would make an easy buck and left everyone to fend for themselves (think Lord of The Flies). Chaos ensued and EVERYONE in the class was left with an extremely bad taste in their mouths. Numerous complaints and grievances were filed, but none were useful. The Instructor was pretty much your GOD and would hold your grades hostage as a way to control the masses. Simple concepts were made extremely difficult for no good reason. We surmised that it was a way for him to look and feel superior. No one was impressed. TAs were extremely combative to the point of putting people down because they just can (This TA has been named in another review here. Go look it up. ). We were graded, tested, and penalized for things that were not expected for this course and were not required in the contractual syllabus. When students brought this up, TAs proceeded to publicly shame students. Total arrogance and elitism were used in an attempt to quell dissent, but didn't work. This replacement instructor was a total embarrassment to the Georgia Tech Name and to PhDs everywhere. If the instructor had no intention of sticking to their deadlines, where do they get the right to penalize students for late submissions, when they, with their ambiguity, confusion, and off-the cuff comments, were the source of lateness?!?!\n\nIf we could give ZERO stars, we would. \n\nI feel sorry for the upcoming ML4T class in 2017 Summer and Fall. Apparently this instructor (Arpan) has been promoted and will \"teach\" ML4T!\n\nGood luck everyone. Run while you still can!\n\n(By the way, the difficulty level is not for the difficulty of the course. It is for the difficulty of the Instructor and TAs) Hmm, interesting course overall - in the end, I got the A I wanted but my brutally honest assessment of myself is that I didn't earn that A. In terms of the R programming side of the course, I use R on a daily basis at work so the assignments were a breeze. The projects were cool and make the student think and formulate informed hypotheses about the data. Based on my own grades, I felt like some parts of the project (the second project in particular) were graded too leniently (i. e., some parts where I felt I put \"adequate\" answers, but nowhere near the best answer or result possible, I still got full marks). \n\nThe final was baffling (in terms of the grade I got on it). My honest assessment of my performance was that I probably earned in the 65-75 range, but I was shocked to see that I scored in the 90s. It was very open-ended and I made sure to answer every part of every question, but I do feel like I missed the bar on some of the questions in which I received perfect marks. \n\nThese are good problems to have, I guess (rather than the other way around). \n\nOverall, nice class, and it's unfortunate that Prof. Lebanon (who produced the very nice lectures) will not be continuing as the instructor of record. Given that, it remains to be seen how generously this course will be graded in the future. This review is for the OMSCS version taught by Dr. Joyner. \n\nIt seems from some of the reviews on here and comments on Piazza, that this class is very polarizing. Either you seem to hate it or love it. I personally hated it. It's my first OMSCS course, so I have little to compare it to. \n\n<b>Pros:</b>\n<ul><li>The class is extremely easy. The first quarter of the class is basically an introduction to R and an overview of the difference between scatter-plots and box-plots. If you can't pull an A, or at least a B, a master's program may not be right for you at this time. </li>\n<li>Dr. Joyner does seem to care about his students and this program. While he seemed overwhelmed at times, you could tell that he cared and wanted everyone to succeed. </li>\n</ul>\n<b>Cons: </b>\n<ul><li> The homework/assignments/exams are poorly written. This is especially true for both the midterm and final exam, which had quite a few questions that could have multiple answers depending on the interpretation of what was actually being asked. A few students started a mini Piazza \"revolt\" where they threatened to escalate issues with the class/midterm if their grievances weren't answered (ironically, they then learned that the person to escalate these issues to for OMSCS is Dr. Joyner).    </li>\n<li> There are a lot of helpful TAs, but they never seemed to be on the same page. There were multiple instances where I would get two very different answers to the same question from different TAs. For example, multiple TAs said on Piazza and Slack that homework had to be done in LaTeX to receive credit. However, when they posted \"exemplary homeworks\" one student had literally hand written his homework, taken pictures with his phone, and cut/pasted the images into a word document.</li>\n<li> The lectures are hilariously bad. It's like they were made in some dystopian future where everyone must speak in a monotone voice and ideas can only be expressed through Word 2010 clip art. More importantly, some of the required readings have massive errors. I was pretty disappointed that this course has been going on for multiple years, and this hasn't been fixed. I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out Dr. Lebanon's logistic regression proof, only to realize (about two hours in) that it's just wrong. </li></ul>\n\nOverall, if you want an easy A or want to learn R, take this class.  As some others have said, this is one of the worst classes I have ever taken. The material is interesting, but the class is managed ridiculously poorly. I've done okay in the course so far, but communication is so incredibly bad I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone. New professor this semester, so older reviews might not be super relevant anymore. **Positives**\n\nI enjoyed the assignments, and they seemed to be only as time consuming as one wanted to make them (for the most part, anyway). If you're a perfectionist and like finding out the \"right\" approaches to problems (eg, using the R vectorization instead of a for-loop, or tweaking your regression parameters to minimize RMSE as much as possible), the assignments can take a while. \n\nEach assignment was written in R, and you'll get a pretty decent grasp of the language. I would feel comfortable using it in a professional environment now.\n\nThere are five activities you can perform that each add 1 point of extra credit to your grade.\n\nThe TA's and students are very helpful on Piazza and Slack. I can't even count how many times I got stuck on a problem, only to find a relevant post somewhere on the community boards.\n\nDr. Joyner seems a lot about making a somewhat infamous class better and fairer to students. I don't agree at all with the below reviewer from my same semester who questions his ethics. It's clear that Joyner listened to student concerns and made fair adjustments. \n\n**Negatives**\n\nTo be honest, a few of the lectures were flat out boring to me. On the other hand, others were hilarious and bordered on the surreal - almost like I was watching a Tim and Eric episode. For example, Dr Lebanon has a penchant for using a cutout of his own head to illustrate topics, like when he mashed together angel and devil clip-art over his shoulder to represent Frequentists and Bayesians arguing... all the while talking about the topic in his droning monotone. Hilarious. I don't want to overstate it though - some of the lectures were great, and I'll likely watch some of them again.\n\nLots of the assignment instructions were pretty unclear, although I'm thankful to the TA's and other students for clearing most of them up. The midterm had some ambiguity in it too (not great for a multiple selection/multiple choice test), but to the instructors credit, they rectified the obvious ones and gave students' credit.   I'd strongly recommend not to take this course in your first term. This is a new class with plenty of ambiguity and disorganization. In case you haven't notice, there is an overoptimism around in this program, which is a good thing most of the time, but let's be brutally honest, this class is not any better than many of the ML introduction courses that you can find online. If you already know something about ML, then this class will be easy, if not, you are going to constantly look for more references, as the epic Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng, or the Data Science specialization on Coursera. \nThe final exam was a disaster, we got partial details of it until days before to take it. They told us that there were only 3 questions, but actually each question had 3 equally complex subquestions. There were topics on it that we didn't see during the course and weren't listed on the prerequisites, how were we suppose to answer those questions? we'll never now because we never received feedback of the final. Apparently for some students, this is ok as it's been like that on other classes, but come on! it is not ok! we need feedback to learn and do better, if not it is a waste of time. Context: I took this class in Spring 2017, as first OMSCS class, and without any prior ML experience. Before I took the class I checked the Workload estimate here, which was in my case underestimated. The workload vary depending on assignments, there were weeks with -/+ 30h, others with +/-10h. Overall, it was not an easy class. Piazza was too noisy and sometimes overwhelming to focus on the valuable posts. I believe this is common problem for all classes with large audiences. I hope the next classes will run smoother and better. More details: https://cse6242. gatech. edu/spring-2017/schedule/ This class is great! Professor Guy is very knowledgeable and taught very well in terms of practically use and theory behind regression, feature engineering and feature reduction. This course is really useful for daily tasks or project for data science work Course was a good introduction to data visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatterplots, etc.) and to logistic and linear regression.  The course used R, which I have come to dislike mostly, at least compared to Python.\n\nVideos are a good introduction to concepts that I had to research further.  After further research, coming back to the lectures made more sense.   Likewise with the readings.  I had to iterate to learn the material.\n\nI really enjoyed the homework and project.  They were challenging, but applicable to further ML work.\n\nThe course instructor wasn't on Piazza much, if at all, but there were several TAs who answered questions quickly, and fellow students were also very helpful.\n\nGrading took forever, but this wasn't really a problem since the homework was only minimally dependent on knowing earlier concepts, so knowing if you did well on something wasn't a hinderance.\n\nThe final was hard.  Even being open book and open internet, it was difficult to complete within the 2 hours allowed.  I feel I earned my grade.\n\n Classwork was relatively simple, but working in R proved to be difficult for this newcomer. When the class took a hard pivot to logistic/linear regression, the material was more difficult, but the grading was more lenient. If you know how to use R, this class will be a breeze. Otherwise, the learning curve for the programming language was the largest hurdle for me. This is the class from hell for all of the wrong reasons. This included an absent instructor, a sarcastic TA, vague/contradicting assignment instructions, and extremely late grade returns. I (wisely) withdrew from the course the day before the deadline because I could not handle the stress. I regretted my decision at first, but the class did not get any better. Some say it got worse. I know this because I kept up with it on Slack and Piazza. All this being said, I feel like I would have gotten an A or a B in the course had I kept with it, but it would have put too much of a strain on my mental state. \n\nThe content itself is genuinely useful and interesting. I have little or no complaints as far as that goes. Several of the TAs did seem to go above and beyond the call of duty to try to salvage the class. You will read a ton about the R language. If you have experience with python Pandas library, then it should be (somewhat) familiar. \n\nMy advice to potential students is to wait until they fix the class to take it unless you need it immediately to fulfill the ML specialization. My advice to GT is to cast this class back into the abyss. \n\nEDIT: Also, the extremely positive review below is bullshit. The complaints about this class are legitimate. Many of the people \"complaining\" (including myself) have successfully completed many OMSCS courses without the kinds of issues experienced in this class. It is a good introductory course to learn R and linear/logistic regression, however there isn't much guidance so you will be learning on your own if you don't have prior experience. The professor and class are very organized and there isn't too much work, but the class had a lot more potential. The instructor works at Netflix and has great experience, but IMO didn't teach much from his real-world experience. I didn't learn any neat techniques that I could apply in a professional position or show-off in an interview, just the basics that I could teach myself from random online resources. This class used R and covered the  visual presentation of results, and the techniques of logistic and linear regression.\n\nI really liked how the class was organised by alternating easier and harder assessments - each time I finished a harder assessment it was followed by an easier assessment.  This allowed my to catch my breath a bit after a difficult assessment, but perhaps more importantly it allowed me time to think about the work I had just done without charging straight into the next assessment.  I think being allowed a bit of time just to ponder helped me truly understand the topics.\n\nThe staff were active on Piazza and helpful.  Overall I really enjoyed this class.  This semester, the course was well organized and well managed. All the projects, homework and optional assignments were posted at the beginning of the semester, and the rules were very clear.\n\nThe schedule included a project every week (some of them optional and very small, but there were two larger projects) and a Udacity lecture accompanied by a short reading every two weeks or so.  Plus two open-book, open-internet exams. It was very manageable. To do well, one just needs to stick to this simple schedule.\n\nThe course is R-based, but it assumes no knowledge of R, spending the first couple of weeks teaching it. There is no need to learn it beforehand.\n\nThe first half of the course could be called \"Intro to working with data using R\", while the latter half could be called \"Intro to Machine Learning\". It's not clear to me why it spends so much time on machine learning topics, but it does, covering subjects such as linear regression, logistic regression, and regularization.\n\nInteracting with professor Joyner is a great pleasure - he's a fantastic teacher. On the other hand, the course seemed understaffed. I don't really mind the grading taking a little longer, but I think it's unfortunate that our inquiries about specific midterm questions were never fully addressed.\n\nOverall it's a solid course, especially for people new to the program. There are couple of major problems with this class.\n1) Professor is missing. I am not sure why his name is part of this course. This course needs to be redesigned by someone who owns it.\n2) The lectures are from Dr Guy Lebanon are pretty dry, math based and doesn't provide actual implementation basis. To me, it felt like you have to bridge the gap between theory and implementation. Without any background, it is very difficult. The course pre-requisites does not say you need ML background but you do.\n3) The grading throughout the course is inconsistent, the exam fairly difficult.\n4) The TAs are helpful if you know the material. They will not teach anything. I struggled throughout the course with no significant help in understanding the material.\nConclusion: Don't take this course unless the course gets redesigned under a new professor. Course was well run with Dr. Joyner. The homework, activities and projects were interesting and directly relate to the course lectures. Piazza was very active, and the TAs and other students were very helpful with questions. Great course to take as one of the first few courses in OMSCS. The first homework is R focused, so you have some time to pick up R if you have not done it before. I was very disappointed in this course. It felt very rough - there's little lecture and many assignments required considerable time searching the web to figure out things you needed that weren't in the class material. Students found the assignments ambiguous, and piazza questions were answered very slowly and not in a clear manner. The original professor, Dr. Lebanon, was swapped out for Dr. Chakraborty and I just felt he wasn't really prepared for the class. Assignment time started very short, but then ramped up to be very large. I found the 10 questions on project 1 were taking 9-10 hours each, which got to be a real problem. It felt like the instructors had not done the assignments themselves and didn't have a good understanding of their sizing, plus ambiguity and uncertainty in grading (only 1 HW was returned by week 8) made you tend to overdo everything. It's unfortunate because I like the topic and Dr. Chakraborty did take steps to restructure assignments, but the overall theme was \"too little, too late\". Also the syllabus is strange - the second half is all basic machine learning, and didn't feel like it belonged, while there was no treatment of visual esthetics - what makes a visualization look good vs. bad, how to style it best, etc. I would wait until this class is much more mature. Great first course for OMSCS. After taking the course, I have a much better understanding of regression and the basics of machine learning as well as a pretty solid foundation in R.\n\nI have an undergrad degree in CS from 10 years ago and haven't coded much since then, and I found it fairly straightforward to keep up. The homework assignments and projects were fairly time consuming for me because I didn't know R at all, but they were interesting and I learned a lot. Some weeks I spent 10-15 hours, other weeks I spent 0 because there was only a small extra credit assignment due. I found it fairly easy to get an A.\n\nI watched the lectures religiously early on, but later on I found the class discussions and google to be much more helpful. The TAs were helpful, but honestly I found the other students to be the most helpful. The professor was more of a manager of the TAs than a professor, but that's fine.\n\nI was intimated by the requirements of linear algebra and calculus since I am many years removed from college, but it didn't turn out to be that bad. One assignment requires you to do partial derivatives to come up with the equation you need to implement, but it wasn't too bad to fumble through with the help of Piazza. The other assignments did not require much deep math knowledge.\n\n I felt this was a great course to start with in the OMSCS program. I did, however, feel that the projects/homework were unnecessarily time consuming and beat the bush too much. It would have been better to cover more topics with shorter assignments. Also, I fell like a lot less time should have been spent on teaching R. It seems to me that everyone in this program should be able to pick up a new programming language with little to no hand holding.  I learned most of content by myself. I didn't see participation of prof and TA to make this class interesting. Semester is almost over but my initial assignment grades still not out. Class is not very well organized which make it tough. I recommend don't take this class unless it is fixed. This is worst class among all courses that i have taken so far This is a decent course. Though beware of the comments here because Prof. Guy Lebanon will not be taking Spring 2017. With that in mind I found this course to be a tad too easy. If you have a background in vector calculus and R the homework would be straight forward with basic data munging and proofs. \n\nThe final exam was... strange and the projects were sufficiently challenging. It will be curious what future iterations look like. This is what I'd call a \"cake\" course. You can coast with minimal effort. There are 6 hours of lecture - you can go through all of it over a week. Sure, you learn a bit about R, and a few data visualization techniques, but when it comes to machine learning, you learn the most basic, rudimentary stuff that's taught in any ML course - logistic and linear regression. Seriously - take Andrew Ng's course and you'll know more. If you just want a course where you have to spend the least amount of effort, learn very little, maybe pair it with a very hard course, then this course is for you. If you want even a small amount of challenge, avoid this course like the plague! The lectures are ancient. They were recorded years ago by Guy Lebanon. Guy may be a smart dude, but he is completely incapable of lecturing in a comprehensible way. Also, the descriptions and pre-reqs say nothing about the higher level math you need. I swear there were symbols I've never seen. I did 2 semesters of Calculus over 25 years ago (as well as a semester of linear algebra).\nThe homeworks and projects were generally OK. Homework 3 required you to code logistic regression by hand, when there are perfectly good functions built in, so that was pretty absurd. Especially since the lectures were very high level. It was basically the old game where they teach you how to draw an owl by drawing 2 ovals and then in the next frame show you a finished detailed owl. Good luck with that one.\nThis was my first class. If my next semester is the same experience, I will be dropping out. I learned very little (I actually have taken some ML courses before) and found it highly frustrating. (Only took this class because it was a requirement for ML specialization.  Now that CV counts for ML, I would strongly recommend taking that instead.)\n\nI basically learned nothing in this class that wasn't already covered in the first few weeks of ML.  Do you already know what a histogram, scatterplot and boxplot are?  awesome, you can skip most of the first half of the semester.  \n\nI like Dr Joyner, but I think he inherited a bad situation.  Lectures had a few interesting bits, but mostly took a long time to say something pretty straightforward.  Homeworks/projects were tedious and had to be written in R.  Graders deducted points for random things which weren't even in the instructions.  Both of the exams were poorly-written and somewhat ambiguous.  (There were disputes on a significant number of the questions.)  On the plus side, the homeworks and projects were released ahead of time, so at least you could work ahead if your scheduled allowed. There are two phases for this course - Phase 1 - From day 1 to Exam - 1 - Its good, fun and motivating[R, R and R].\nPhase 2 - Here the course takes a turn and goes into ML side which - will be very hard if you have not  taken any course on ML. I am from non ML side and literally had very hard time progressing in Phase 2.\nBTW - Dont think that the course material is going to help in Phase 2.\n The course itself it is not hard, but it is very hard to get good grades. There is no rubic or grading policy at all. And most of assignments questions are ambiguous. TAs are very lazy and don't answer the questions or answered in a very misleading way. Then at grading stage, they will surprise you and interpret the question in a different way it is being asked, and deduct points from the students. A few classic examples: 1. what is the growth rate of different format of file size? (They graded with big(O) notation) 2. Describe your observation (grading notes released after three weeks of submission saying, you can't say A is bigger than B, you have to say A is 4% and B is 3%, so A is bigger than B). The answer is in the figure the students submit, but the reason most of us didn't put them in the final conclusion is the assignment didn't ask it in the beginning. \nDefinitely the worst course have been seen in OMSCS This is an excellent class. I have learned a lot about R that helps me writing predictive analytic coding effectively. Tutorials are so exceptionally well done and applicable it is misleading that it is simple. Exellent instruction which makes leaps into application reasonable *does not mean it is easy*. This is how courses should be structured. The projects and homework are challenging, not simple. They apply what you are being taught while requiring a stretch for you to apply the concepts. I thought this was full of a lot of practical and meaningful work, and highly recommend this class to anyone. You'll really love the assignments. I did. Very interesting to do. Also, just so you know, how people are saying it takes 3 hours is beyond me. Not if you are including pacing projects and homework into your assessment. I read a comment about 30 hours per project over 2-3 weeks... and agree. Plan well, 30/(2-3 weeks mentioned) = about 10-12 hours time. Good course in my opinion. Starts off easy and gets harder at the end. I knew R coming into it which made everything a lot simpler. Definitely a good course to take before you take machine learning. Gives you a background in R, and touches upon the beginnings of machine learning with linear regression. *TLDR*: This is a graduate program, you are expected to work hard and work beyond what is provided to you. This course is an intro to ML/Data Science. Don't take it if you took ML already. \n\nThis was my first class at GT. I paired it along with KBAI. Although it's recommended to not take more than one class at a time, it wasn't my first time taking online classes, so I knew how to deal with the self-discipline of handling an online class. That being said:\n\nThe class wasn't difficult, but it was challenging. The first half of the course is a breeze (assuming you have programming experience and know basic statistics/visualizations). The second half of the course was more challenging, but it's where you learn. We implemented Logistic Regression from scratch, had to derive the cost function (partial derivative), and analyzed datasets, etc. The course serves more as an intro to Data Science as it covers visualizing data, cleaning data, modeling data, and deriving conclusions from data, overall making you think like a Data Scientist. I don't have a formal ML background (although I work in a Data Analytics team, so I'm exposed to it), so a lot of this material was not new for me. I do believe this is a good intro to ML/Data Science. \n\nOn another note, you will have to do independent studying to handle the 2nd half of the course. Prof Lebanon is quite dry and personally it was very difficult to pay attention to his lectures. Also, I didn't enjoy his teaching style. I made good use of Andrew Ng's ML course in order to understand some of the topics discussed in the second half.\n\nHaving completed only one of the extra credit tasks (called Activities), I ended up with an A. Professor Joyner taking over is probably the best thing that could've happened to this class. \n\nOne annoying part of this class however was how unprepared some students seemed to have been for a graduate program of this caliber (this is one of the easier courses of the program). Piazza was almost unbearable with the amount of simplistic questions that could have either been figured out independently or by a simple google search. I understand lots of people don't come from a CS/Software Engineering background, but the amount of hand holding some people needed/expected was almost ridiculous. It was my first course. You would better to learn R in advance since it is a mandatory for homework & projects. However, the course is very reasonable and easy to follow even though two projects are quiet time consuming. The schedule of the course was not tight so that you would take another course as well. There were two exams but it was open book based and not that difficult. If you did not miss any projects and homework, you would get easily get an A. I recommend. Worst course ever... And I mean it. I just finished the whole master program and this IS the worst class. Fall 2016 was the first time the class was put online. The course contents were actually pretty good though quite light. The assignments and projects were also OK. However, the final exam and the overall grading was terrible. There were a dozen TAs, but no grading criteria or rubrics, while all assignments and final exams were essay like reports... This created a total disaster. Maybe because the grading load was too much, TAs did not seem to spend much time on (or even care about) our tens of pages of reports, and the grading was generous but quite random, with no meaningful feedback given. In fall 2016 they put some example assignments on piazza and after the exam, some students voluntarily shared their exams, but similar answers were given very different scores. One of the answers that got full score was almost identical as mine, but mine got 3/11. After I pointed out that my answer was similar to others but got significant lower score, the professor simply said that happens, but since mine was not perfect, the original grading was valid. So in the end I stuck at 79. 7 with a C... \nAdditionally, after the final exam, many students found out that they were not able to see a big chunk of the final exam-a third of the exam didn't show up on proctor track... I still don't know how they dealt with these angry students. \nI filed the grading grievance and started to take the same class again, because I needed it to graduate. As of now, I haven't heard anything from the grievance, and the semester is already ended. \nSpring 2017 is even worse, the instructor disappeared for the most part of the semester, and we only got 20% grading done two weeks before the final. There were several angry posts on Piazza, and some students filed grievances. \nFor this semester, I simply resubmitted most of my assignments with a little editing. And I got higher than 100. Ridiculous. The assignments took me a fairly large amount of time to complete, and I used the available 48 hour extension twice (for a ten point penalty). This course taught me a lot of practical skills that I could apply to my current job and would help anyone who deals with any kind of reporting. The data pre-processing required in the projects can get a little hairy, but it's good practice. Several extra credit assignments were given during the course. This was a good class as my first class in the program. You could easily work ahead if you wished though reading the piazza discussions about the material often helped if you waited till later. As with most grad school classes, you get out of it what you put into it. If you want to spend a lot of time and really get things perfect you can. If you want to spend a lot less time and do the minimum you can still do pretty well you just won't learn as much. If you want a good way to learn R this is a good way to do that and learn some visualization things as well. Liked the projects a lot. The exams were a little tricky, but the instructor was willing to go back and look at them (at least on the midterm). Have not yet attempted the final. This was a great course! It focused on the practical side of data science, with very little theory. Our semester had 3 homework assignments, 2 projects, and a final. The lecture material is light (only 6 hours). The homeworks were easy for me, usually requiring only an afternoon. The projects were based on a movies database. They were both really fun, but can be super time consuming depending on the quality of the report you feel comfortable submitting. I probably went overboard on mine, but mostly because I was enjoying myself. Full marks on the project are likely achievable with about 10-15 hours worth of effort (and we were given 4 weeks). I felt the final was very fair and interesting. Several students had issues with it, but those appeared to be more related to how proctor-track displayed (or hid) the exam questions, rather than with the content itself. The grading tended to be lenient this semester, but that may change with the new instructor. I'm sorry to hear Dr. Lebanon wont be teaching next time. He did a fantastic job. The teacher and the TAs were very active and responsive in the forums. I took this course with Dr. Chau (OMSA). The OMSA course consists of 4 very large assignments and a semester-long group project. I believe this may be the most time-intensive course in the OMSA program, and I recommend either taking it early or as a \"capstone\" class to finish up the program.\n\nThe most challenging part of this course was the amount of time that needed to be put into the assignments and projects. The concepts were arguably quite simple, each assignment required learning one or more new programming languages and/or technologies. Setup of the environments required often took a lot of time too. Dr. Chau was receptive to feedback, and modified the last assignment to have one of the questions be for bonus credit, which helped it be more manageable. It's possible the online course will change dramatically based on the course feedback. That said, it is an incredibly time intensive course and you should plan accordingly.\n\nThe project was... frustrating (to me). The assignments were so time intensive that our team struggled to work on the project early on and ended up pulling things together at the last minute. Another challenge was the difficulty in making group decisions when a group leader wasn't established and the whole team couldn't find time to meet virtually.\n\nI will address the concern about using Azure and AWS with a personal credit card as stated in another review. While, yes, it was annoying and uncomfortable to provide that information, for both services we got much, much more free credit than was needed to complete the assignment, and students who did go over the free limit were able to get the charges waived by calling customer support and explaining the situation. The Azure part of the assignment could be completed on a personal computer and then uploaded to the server, eliminating any chance of error/using up the credit.\n\nI learned so much in this class and was exposed to a large number of data technologies. I know there are some people who struggled greatly with this class, but I found it comparable to (if not easier than) my undergrad engineering courses at a top-ranked engineering school, so the quality was what I expected. I think the class does have room for improvement, and could use more TA support to improve communication and responses to Piazza. All said, I wish I had used this as a capstone class toward the end of my degree and had taken it on its own, so I could have gotten more out of the project. My score is higher than 100 in this course, but I will NOT recommend it. Here are the reasons:\n\n1) The instructor is draggy and not prepared. Can you imagine the instructor is still preparing the final exam, when the exam window is already open. \n2) It takes the TAs extremely long time to response to your request. I ever sent out a private message to my TA, and he responded, after tow-three weeks. \n3) The grading is very slow. Some of the projects are connected. You don't know whether your solution for the previous project is correct, while the second one is already due. \n4) I'm not sure whether the instructor and TAs communicate, because sometimes their responses to student questions contradict to each other. \n\nIn terms of grading, the instructor is lenient. He find every opportunity to give out extra credits. I learned little from this course. All I did is collecting points. \n\nAs a conclusion, if you want to get a high score, go for it; if you want to learn something from the course, avoid it before the instructor is ready. I went into this class with no R experience and did well.  Excellent feedback was left on assignments pointing out areas for improvement.  The extra credit assignments were well worth the effort and addressed topics a little outside the flow of the course.  The most time consuming part was the first project which require a lot of figuring out how to use R to accomplish a number of data processing tasks.  Outside resources were needed so don't expect the lectures to cover everything.  The lectures taught by Professor Lebanon, while somewhat verbose, were excellent.  I had to watch them a couple of times to pick up on Professor Lebanon's many insightful points. Really enjoying this class as my first foray into machine learning. \n- Workload is dependent on a few things: your prior experience in ML, and your willingness to apply yourself. I myself had no prior experience and really wanted to apply myself so that I can properly internalize the core concepts and found myself working around 20 hours a week. However someone with experience in ML and ML4T can get by with no more than 10 hours a week of effort. \n- Math is a tough thing to get up to speed on but we have had some really engaging piazza discussions that solidified my understanding and the students really take it upon themselves to make sure their fellow classmates are in a position to succeed. It's great. \n- Instructor is very responsive and I have yet to see a relevant question unanswered by him. Hes got some great experience in ML and does a good job of breaking down the concepts into digestible chunks. \n\nFinal takeaway is to definitely take this class if you are in the ML track but if you are already quite proficient in ML and R, this class may not give you anything more. \"What can one man do against such reckless hate?\"\n\nI hate to make this sound like an amazon review, but DON'T LISTEN TO THE OTHER REVIEWS. \nThe people ridiculing this course are drama queens who take no self-direction and want everything handed on a silver platter. \nMost likely they're industry professionals out of touch with how education has changed in the past 20 years or graduates of inferior schools. \nHonestly every point made by other reviews is complete bull****. \nThe instructor/TAs are very helpful if you have questions and easily accessible via Piazza, Slack, and email. \nYou can ask them anything related to homework, lectures, and even more in-depth questions related to the material. \nEvery time they WILL help until you confirm your questions are answered. \nI just can't fathom how people are saying they couldn't get in touch with the TA's when they are literally on slack every single day at set hours. \nHonestly, it seems that people who waited until the last minute to do their assignments couldn't get the right answers. \n\nNext, I didn't see much ridicule about lectures or course content, which we can all agree was thorough and useful. Although I did wish we spent less time on R and include another project. \nThe homework and projects were fair with more than enough time, but once again people waited until the last minute to ask questions and panicked when they didn't receive a step-by-step solution to solving the problem... pathetic. \n\nThe only complaint I will make is that grading took way too long. However, if you really need feedback you can just ask the TA if your code is correct. Regardless, you should know if your code is working based on the questions, so the feedback is not useful except for stating why you lost a few points (maybe for not including enough graphs). \n\nDon't let other reviews scare you. \nI know I sound like a drop in the ocean, but being a GT alumni I know the difference between a good and bad course. \nThis is definitely the former. Looking at the materials I thought this would be an easy introductory course. Though the content is introductory, the poor organization of the course makes it too difficult. There is no specific rubic for grading the homework and projects. You will end loosing marks for unnecessary reasons that were not pre-specified. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this course as the first course. It would give you a bad impression about the program. This course is a disorganized mess! The assignments are vague, but the grading is specific. In the previous semester, Dr. Lebanon was very involved and helped students understand the assignment intent. This semester, Dr. Chakraborty was MIA most of the semester. The grading was inconsistent, the TAs were frequently combative, and the instructor's solutions to problems were frequently terrible. \n\nOur final exam appears to have been written at the last minute. Out of 35 questions, 3 were on material not covered in the course, 3 had issues that caused the instructor to admit they were bad, and 2 had multiple correct answers. To make up for these questions, the instructor added 3 points to everyone's score and then refused to take any grade challenges. This solution is unfair and took many students from an A to a B gradewise. I was fortunate to not be one of them, but this class is the worst run class I have experienced out of 9 OMS classes - I am sorry I took it!\n\nThe on-campus course this spring looks like an amazing course, dealing with lots of big data technologies. Instead, we got a basic introduction to R, which I hope to never see again - it's that poor a language choice. This class really should be taught in Python and should cover more relevant topics like the on campus course. I doubt Dr. Chakraborty will be back, but unless the lectures/topics are reviewed, I cannot recommend that anyone take this course. I would rate this course zero stars if possible. I have a master and PhD in EE and completed thirty plus online courses on Coursera and Edx. This is sixth OMSCS course and by far one of the worst three courses I have ever taken in my entire life. I would quite the program if this were my first course. The content is very simple, some quirky R language, logistic/linear regression, and regularization for feature selection. The near nonexistence of course organization and lack of pedagogy make the course very difficult. Basically, the professor plays the video recorded by another professor and TAs do the grading without interacting to students. I requested clarification on Piazza via a private post. A TA replied after 14 days and with 3 reminders. The professor lacks basic pedagogic skills. There are a lot of ambiguities in the project spec, e. g., phrases \"describe as precise as possible\" are used in the project spec for HW2 instead of explicitly listing all items are required. Another example is that he asks the students to describe patterns in a plot and later we are penalized for not explaining the plausible reasons for the patterns according to the grading rubric. It is funny that the grading rubric is released two or three weeks after the homework were submitted. The project spec is so ambiguous that there are literally hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and contradictory information are posted by TAs and the professor. There is one TA responded students post with sarcasm and in confrontational tone. I believe this course is bad enough to raise attention from the school. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera is better alternative for basics. \n\nUpdate:\nConstant delay on releasing grade and even the final exam was released a few hours late. The last two extra credited assignment were obviously rushed out and questionably violating schools rules. Received \"A\", but this does not change facts. While there is room for improvement, this class definitely isn't quite the hot mess that it was in some previous semesters. Like the Fall 2017 semester, Professor Joyner once again joined the instructor team to help ensure things ran more or less smoothly. And by \"help\", I mean he appeared to be \"the\" instructor for the course (despite what the course sign-up states, Professor Chakraborty was not involved in anything student-facing). Dr. Joyner and the TAs did a nice job keeping us up-to-date and on-track, though it's a continued pet peeve of mine when an instructor literally ignores their students for the entire semester.\n\nContent-wise, the first half of the course's lectures were pretty good. Dr Lebanon's explanations and manner-of-speaking tend to make things needlessly complicated, especially when getting into the more math-heavy topics, but nothing was too overwhelming. The second half of the course was a lot harder to follow, again mainly due to the way the content was presented. Several students posted alternate sources of information on Piazza that made the concepts much easier to understand. It's like too much focus was placed on the theory and exact formulas rather than what it actually means in practice.\n\nThe projects and homeworks were all pretty fair, in my opinion, even though I came in with no R experience whatsoever. Some assignments were intimidating to start, but became more manageable after spending some time playing with them. The TAs also posted helpful hints for some assignments. The exams were both a bit crude, handled via ProctorTrack. The midterm had a lot of disagreement with wording and ambiguity. The instructor team did eventually address a few of the questions about a month later and gave some points back, but other questions were never clarified.\n\nGrade-wise, it still seems fairly easy to get an A as long as you're not waiting until the last minute to do an assignment (and almost everything is available from the first week of class, so there's no need to wait). Four homeworks worth 10% each, two projects worth 20% each, two exams worth 10% each, and 5 activities worth 1% each. Since that's 105%, you've got 15% of leeway to stay in \"A\" range. There didn't seem to be many issues with grading as long as you followed the requirements.\n\nCommunication-wise is where things could have been better. The TAs were great for office hours on Slack and generally responsive on Piazza, but private posts would get ignored and it seemed like there were some topics the TAs didn't want to get involved with.\n\nAll-in-all, a pretty good class if you're interested in R, but the lectures were often awkward to watch and the algebra portions didn't really add much to the course in any meaningful way. This course builds a very solid foundation with R and basics of data science. Though it does not delve much into many ML algorithms, it focuses well on visualizations and key regression algorithms. Since it was a first offering, the structure of the course was bit vague and exam a bit surprising. But that said, overall a good course that is very informative I took the first iteration of this course with prof. Guy Lebanon. The course is fairly easy and doesn't require a lot of time, it's a good introduction to some machine learning (very basic) and data visualization, which may come in handy in later courses. There were some complaints with the grading in the end, but that's expected from first time courses. Lectures are high level and not close to what may be needed to complete the homework and assignment. It requires higher level maths. I personally feel not much was learned through this class. Also, the course content needs to be refreshed. I think it's all been said already, so I'll merely agree with all the other awful reviews. Worst \"prof\" ever. He should certainly not be hired to teach in our program again. \n\nAlso, I've seen some students dismissing negative reviews on G+ several times before saying those are just the students who weren't prepared or didn't get good grades, etc. So I want to make clear, I'm getting an A. Doesn't change the facts. \n\nSome of the TAs were helpful in getting through the course despite the madness: thanks Ravish, Ryan and Adrian. \nThis could be a great class, but not until they get a real prof. This course was not well organized. Interesting class if you want to see Data Science from an R (vs Python) perspective. R is an 80's language with all the benefits and liabilities of a legacy system. The projects can be large and quite time-consuming; but not too difficult. \n\nI can see how you would use R professionally and there is demand for the skill, but it's not my cup of tea. IMHO : Cobalt + Data = R Fun and solid class, but very light in material. I watched all the lectures the first weekend, they were mostly review but nonetheless they did help hammer home some good fundamentals so they were worthwhile. Workload picked up in the second half of the class. I have taken 10 classes and this was one of the easiest. \n\nProfessor Lebanon stressed he wanted the class to bridge the gap between a purely academic class with one with applications more for the real world as well. As somebody who has served both as a professor at top research institutions and worked at respected companies in industry, he is qualified to design such a class. \n\nI took the class in Fall and I see there are negative reviews from Spring. Not exactly sure what happened, because the lecture materials are the exact same and I understand the assignments were almost the exact same. Sounds like assignments not being returned in a timely fashion is a valid concern, but I imagine should be fixed with future iterations of the class. But some of the complaints about the material and the ambiguity of grading seem unwarranted, I don\u2019t necessarily expect a class to have to explicitly lay out grading criteria ahead of time and they weren\u2019t in the Spring and students did not complain. I am puzzled why reviews are THAT different between semesters. Maybe the class got a reputation as an easy intro class (I would say mostly true) and maybe this shifted expectations and student demographic of the class. Great course! I've used R programming language for years but still learned a great deal about more efficient ways to manipulate and plot the data. This is great introduction to ML (Logistic and Linear Regression). If you have any back ground in this topic then the class is very easy. Essentially the class teaches you how to use R in a very gentle manner. \n\nThere were 5% extra credit on offer. \n\nThe class has been significantly improved since Dr. Joyner took over. I had no complains as the class was run extremely well. This class can easily be done with another easy or medium difficulty class. \n\nThe projects and HWs were well thought out and lead from one to the other in a systematic manner. Finally the exams were easy multiple choice with open everything. So the class was essentially an Easy A class. \n\nI would recommend that all new starters thinking of doing ML specialization do this course as it has been significantly improved. You can ignore all the old bad reviews.   A very good introduction to R and data visualization concepts. Also, a brief introduction to ML concepts. The lectures were not helpful at times; especially towards the end (Regularization etc).\nProjects were time consuming so make sure you have enough time in hands to complete and submit on time.\nExtra credits for the Activities did help in the end to get an A grade; inspite of the difficult and slightly confusing final exam (open everything).\nOverall, I am glad I took this course in-spite of the bad reviews from previous semesters. This time around it seemed a lot better organized in terms of communication - I believe it was the Joyner effect. When Professor Lebanon taught this course, it was excellent. A few bumps with it being a new course were far outweighed by a highly engaged class and teaching staff that made it very enjoyable. There were real-world problems and a challenging/fun exam that pushed you to think instead of just recite back lectures/material. It was useful to learn the guts of the mathematics behind some of the core algorithms (e. g., gradient descent). Some students complained/struggled about having to use high school/early college Calculus but it should be reasonable/expected in a graduate program like this one and in particular the field of ML and Data Science. R was also incredibly useful to learn and has served me well in industry. I loved the inaugural professor (Lebanon) as he had a very practical approach without neglecting the theory, either. The general workload wasn't bad, but the projects could definitely suck you into trying to work indefinitely to improve results (self-imposed). All programming was exclusively using the \"R\" language... I was happy to pick up a new tool out of the deal! The biggest concern I had, but I accepted during the first, registration, week of class was the homework/project/final grades were all equally weighted at 1/3 of the grade. This was a concern and a bit of stress toward the end of the semester, but I was a consenting adult/student like everyone else in the class, so I didn't think it was unfair. I would say the course was neither unbearable nor easy. I earned an A and think those who participated did reasonably well. I'm writing this one week before the semester is over. If you are registered or waitlisted for this course PLEASE read the Spring 2017 reviews! \n\nThis class has been the worst I've taken in this program. I've rated this class as Easy because the contents are basic and the assignments are not complicated. This course should be seen as \"Learn R by example\". However, having a large class created dozens of different interpretations to the homework instructions that eventually led to great degrees of confusion. I have a perfect score in all returned grades so far and it has been because I've stayed away from Piazza and office hours. I just read and re-read the assignment instructions always thinking what else I would want to see if I was grading this assignment. I know that some will say it is not the student's role but the methodology of going above and beyond has worked well in this program. \n\nOne of the main issues this class had was amount of contradicting information given many times. In several occasions it was mentioned to us that the TAs had a hard time reaching the professor when asked to clarify. \n\nThe staff in this class needs to be evaluated. It was evident the TAs don't talk to each other and a few do not know how to handle students' queries. One in particular tried to seem tough in front of the class justifying their answers by telling everyone that this is GT (I agree with this argument). However the tone and level of sarcasm used in (their) posts came out as confrontational. You are an instructor and if you are part of the team that answers the forums you need to work on your communicational skills! If you are frustrated, take a break and answer a post in a couple of hours or take a walk before answering!\n\nAs a side note, there is a review here that claims the professor was blaming the TAs for \"dropping the ball\", That is not true, it was a TA that said that. \n\nTL;DR: Wait for this class to be reviewed by GT! I took the class with Dr. Chakraborty. I agree with the other reviews on here. The class was basically a train wreck. Inconsistent grading, combative TA's, unclear instructions, slow and inadequate responses from the TA's and teacher. The teacher didn't seem engaged with the class at all. Easily one of the worst classes I've ever taken. For those of you who are considering taking this class, be sure that you are reading reviews of the class with the current instructor rather than the old one, Dr. Lebanon. From what I've read the class was much better before Dr. Lebanon left. This Course is my first course in GT OMSCS, I preferred this after reading so many Good reviews about it, But it left me frustrated, thinking why I picked this one. \nCourse material is pretty easy, but the way Projects/Assignments are handled is pathetic, not worth of recognized US University. Too much of ambiguity, too much of (needless) load, makes learning second priority., e. g. Use of loops, run it 5 times, 10 times, 500 times, sorta questions, asking Complexity, No doubt this is essentials, but DVA is not meant for that. \nAnd cryptic messages for communication, asking TA's Or Prof. question over piazza or slack, u get very terse/generic feedback. I just couldn't realize Did TA/Prof. wanted to remove ambiguity or add to it. Like any stupid student I dared sometime, to re-ask the next question, to get No further reply. \nSome of my Piazza posts remained, unanswered. If I pass this course, it would be because of my own work and students who were active and prompt on piazza. \nNewly hired Prof. n TA's, Couldn't make this course interesting, neither they could make us realize potential of the course. Project/Assignment grading took forever, Course is about to finish, and we're yet \nto get feedback for half of our work. \nWith all due respect, I really doubt their credentials, to carry on, GT plz review this staff. \nDespite student asking for ideal answers, we never got any positive feedback on it. Grading is generous at times, but, rather than that, I'd prefer, what went wrong and how can I improve it. \nOhh, and how can we forget, TA Jiachen Yang's epic sarcasm. I think This guy, should be given privilege to write, pre-requisite section of DVA/and every other subject in OMSCS for next semesters. \nFall2017/Summer2017 ** Won't recommend this course, until GT reviews this ** __Pros:__\n\n- Easy class to get an A, especially with all the extra credit activities and lenient assignment/project grading.\n- The topic is fairly interesting and gives you a solid foundation for machine learning.\n- TAs and Prof. Joyner are super helpful in terms of communications and clarifications. Great work there.\n\n__Cons:__\n\n- The class felt too easy for a top graduate level CS program\n- The video lectures are useless beyond just giving an overview of the topics. Reading extra materials and researching online is a must\n\n__Misc:__\n- Remember to use Brent's notes for your exams (you'll know what they are when you are taking the course) They are the best. This was my first course in OMSCS. Initially I was apprehensive about R and linear algebra and calculus (last time I did that was 17 yrs ago). For learning R, the course provides sufficient time to learn the language and I also heavily used the DataCamp \u201cData Analyst with R\u201d track and it made the homework\u2019s and projects a breeze. To tackle algebra and calculus, I referred to Khan Academy. Both these resources are more than sufficient to prepare for the course. \n\n The homework\u2019s, projects and activates are announced up front so that we can plan about them. Make sure you do all the activities since they are extra credits and help if one of the homework or project does not go well. The grading is lenient and it is not difficult to score an A. I think this is a great course to take first up in the program. This course has been an incredible source of stress, anxiety, and frustration. Though I expected the work to be difficult (my courses last semester in the OMSA program certainly were), it has bordered on impossible at several points given the unreasonably complicated nature of the work we are assigned.  I spent more time decoding confusing instructions and being my own IT support this semester than I did working on any visualization projects or concepts. I was very close to withdrawing from the class and if it weren\u2019t for the group project and the fear of letting my teammates down, I probably would have dropped it.\n\nFor each homework set I spent at least the first week (40+ hours) just trying to get my computer set-up with the software/environments necessary to even start programming. In several instances this has required making changes to the firmware, multiple uninstalls and re-installs all of which are incredibly time-consuming and I think not the point of this course. My only computer is my work computer and I have felt quite nervous about how these changes I have made might impact my machine and my ability to do my job if it were to crash. \n\nTo complete a homework assignment students were required to join Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, both of which required entering personal credit card information. For each of these services there was the potential of running up thousands of dollars in charges if a mistake was made. This is an entirely unacceptable risk to ask students to take. Often learning takes place when mistakes are made and to put a financial burden on students who are already paying to learn is wrong.\n\n\nAt several points throughout the semester direct messages to the instructors went unanswered for days. At one point a very urgent message (labeled as such in the subject line) was ignored for 84 hours. At the point it was answered it was too late.\n\nThe difficulty I have had this semester has caused me to question my future in this program. If the 40+ hours per week of work needed for this course is indicative of any future courses, continuing to pursue this degree will be incompatible with maintaining my full-time job and family responsibilities.  I understand that Tech\u2019s rigor is a part of its great reputation, and fully expected my classes to be very challenging. However, I did not expect to be subjected to unreasonable expectations and poor communication by professors in a professional graduate curriculum like the \u201cweed-out\u201d courses I had during undergrad.\n Simple course. Try to do activities as they are very simple and easy scoring. Homeworks too are quite simple project need some thinking. Try to do R before starting the term. (To be updated hopefully once the term ends)\nThe class this semester started on the wrong foot, and the general experience had been sour since then. It is a shame because the instructor is really keen on making the experience very educational and fun. He has prepared non-required activities where you can probably learn more without the pressure of trying to get a good grade. \n\nWhat I think went wrong this thus far:\n- Unpopular decisions made by the instructor team. Personally I do not mind that much, but it is very reasonable for most people not to like it. And with a class size so big, those small \"mistakes\" have bad effects in high order of magnitude. \n- It seems the grading rubrics are not tightly coupled to the learning goals of the homeworks (or at least what I thought to be the goals are). The most popular \"mistake\" was giving huge deductions for missing complexity analysis in an HW where the goal is to get acquainted with R. Or deductions for not giving actual numbers when calculating those values are just incidental to the HW and the main goal was to visualize those numbers (this one is very minor). \n\nI really hope things turn for the better soon. \n\nThe topics in the course were by the way not what I thought they were. I was thinking more on statistics: hypothesis testing, trend analysis (I think this one will be covered), knowing whether the samples are sufficient, blah blah. Stuff I would need if I want to do research and decide to do surveys, A/B tests, whatever. The syllabus was so short I thought there are a lot more in betweens. Not really, that is it. In the HWs, we were usually asked to give an analysis of results. But I don't really know how to give those analysis correctly, so I end up giving very vague analyses (weakly related, higher, lower). I am yet to see my grade for HW2. The Instructor Team has an aversion for vagueness, so I am not very excited about my grade. I got a lot out of this course, and I enjoyed it!\n\nThis course covers R and data visualization in the first half of the course, and then it goes into both theory and use of logistic and linear regression in the second half of the course. I think that the first half of the course is generally useful and not overly challenging. They do provide pointers to an entire book on visualization using the ggplot2 package, which if you read from cover to cover and play around with it could satisfy those who already have exposure to R and ggplot2. The second half of the course will probably be challenging if it is your first exposure to linear and logistic regression, and it will probably not be overly difficult if you have studied those topics before. I did not have that exposure before this class, and the rest of my review assumes that. \n\nAs for pacing, the class is relatively slow in the beginning. You are probably looking at more like 6-8 hours per week on average of required work. If you dive into additional references and optional assignments, you can spend more (and get a deeper understanding). The pace really picks up from the first project onward. As students in past semesters have noted, the projects will take up as much time as you have, and you will always feel like you could have done more. On average, you are probably looking at more like 12-15 hours per week at that point, and it may be bursty. \n\nNow, as for the class logistics... I think most of the reviews for the semester have been at an overly negative extreme, and the one just below seems a bit too positive (hello fellow undergrad alum!). There were problems. They were not handled in the best manner. Piazza became out-of-control negative. Communication from the professor was often sparse. CIOS feedback should be given to avoid this in the future. I am proceeding under the assumption the professor will take CIOS feedback to heart. But if he doesn't, I would avoid his classes in the future. This is my 6th course in the program. By far the worst course I have taken so far in my entire life. I am hoping that they will do some changes. It is utterly disorganized and chaotic. TA's and instructors participation in Piazza is minimal. Just do not take it until they fix the course. I guess Dr. Lebanon was great. We just got unlucky that they have changed the instructor. Course mainly covers R, tools for data visualization in R, Logistic Regression / Linear Regression, and regularization. \n\nThe actual content in the course can be considered light however, the videos and the supplemental readings are so well done I wish every other course could use this course as a template. They are really produced in such a way that is not too math intensive but uses enough to give enough depth in the concepts reviewed. \n\nThe professor and TAs are really involved. They definitely seemed to want to help and resolve all student issues. \n\nThe only thing I disliked about the course was the final. The professor did not prepare us for the final at all. The content on the final was related to what we had learned in the course up to the point but was applied in a completely different way than how it was applied in the homework and project. Also, the final was 33% of the grade (way too high given the type of test given us). I would of preferred an additional midterm + final composing the grade instead of a singular final. This course was very organized and instructors and TA's were very friendly. This class was very active on Piazza and most of my general questions were asked and answered by other students. I did however have a specific code question and sent a private post to my assigned TA but received no response. \n\nThe first half of the course teaches the basics of R and how to model data. This was really helpful because I had no experience with R coming into this course. The second half of the course teaches a few machine learning techniques. I think this is a great course to take before you take the harder machine learning courses. \n\nThe homeworks in the first half of the course were very easy and fun because you get to play with R to create all kinds of visuals for the data. The homeworks in the second half took longer but I felt they were valuable lessons to learn machine learning if you haven't learned it already. There were 2 projects, both of which are not hard if you dedicate the time to do them. Project 1 took much longer than project 2, but project 2 builds off of project 1 and is easy if you did well on project 1 and were able to reuse some of the code. The exams were very easy if you watched the Udacity lectures and read the course readings. Exams are open book, notes, internet (the only thing not allowed is help from another person, chat boxes, etc). The instructor tried to stick very closely to the materials provided and gave us points back for materials on the exam that were not covered or phrased misleadingly. \n\nI think the grading was very lenient on all homeworks, projects, and exams. It would be hard not to receive an A in this class. This is an excellent foundation course for anyone in general, but for anyone considering ML, this will give you a good course to start with. The course is very well structured, and the prof. and TAs were very active. If you want to prepare for this course, I would suggest you complete the Exploratory Data Analysis in R course on Udacity to get a heads up with R. This way you can start with the more interesting topics which start after the mid semester. For math, I found most resources I need from just Khan Academy. I took this class after ML, which made it very easy as most of the ML concepts were just refresher. This is a great introductory class for R / data visuals, but not a great one to start learning ML. I really appreciate Dr.Joyner's effort to keep the course organized, especially by releasing assignments in advance so that I could better manage my time (among other priorities). However, this course doesn't take much time at all. The only time consuming part will be the two projects (and only if you want to get in-depth). Final exam is on an easy-medium difficulty (definitely a lot easier than ML midterm). This was definitely the worst class I've taken in the OMSCS program. \n\nI had such high expectations because the scope of the course looked fantastic! I was excited about learning R and for the potential opportunities I would have to apply what I learned at my workplace. But basically the disorganized, disastrous mess of this class crushed my hopes and dreams. \n\nThings I saw in this class that I've never seen in other classes:\n* Constant contradiction between TAs and professor \n* 6-7 week wait to get a grade back for any assignment\n* TAs abandoning the course for unknown reasons leaving all the work on a handful of TAs\n* Zero guidance on assignment / project expectations\n* Material on final exam was no where to be found in the course\n\nAt the end of this course I basically lost some interest in Data Visual Analytics. It feels like a chore to me now because of how much I really disliked doing work for this class. I'll never forget the moment when the first grade was returned in this class. The Piazza statistics for the class showed that there were 6x the number of posts of a typical day when it was released. People didn't understand what they did wrong. And it took over a week for the instructors to generate any kind of reasoning for the grading. One would think that a rubric should be available to handle discrepancies... but it didn't appear that way. For the rest of the assignments, I felt like I had to perform 150% just to get a good grade on an assignment. For the second project, my report was 40 pages long. I did get an A but I honestly wasn't confident that I had done enough. \n\nThe professor did admit at the end of the semester concerns had been heard and improvements could be made. So hopefully they will be!\n\nOn top of the disorganization, this was also a hard course in general. Here are some things to review if you decide to tackle this course:\n* Machine Learning\n* R (the language)\n* Statistics\n* Calculus \n* Vectorization (specifically in R)\n* Big O", 
    "CSE-6250": " Let me start out by saying that this course is \"lost\", literally. \n\nAt the beginning of the semester, the instructor wrote \"You are expected to learn additional materials beyond lecture and solve the programming problems through largely self-learning. \" I would highly emphasize \"self-learning. \" There is so small a connection between the video lectures and the assignments that you may as well skip all the videos. And it shows. At the end of the semester, a student-run survey found that 15 students learned more on their own versus 2 students learned more from instructions. This is a lost of instructional goal. \n\nThe course composes of 2 unrelated parts. The first part has 4 assignments. The second part has 1 open-ended project. You are assumed to know Python, Scikit-Learn, HDFS, HDMR, Hive, Pig, Scala, Spark, GraphX, MLlib, Zeppelin. The provided environments are versions of both local and AWS Docker containers, and Vagrant images with CentOS, CoreOS, and Ubuntu. This gives a feeling of a kid playing with various toys and can't decide which one to take home. The issue is worse when you find out that the provided scripts don't even work out of the box! It is a lost of focus. \n\nThe open-ended project suffers from many problems. When the assignments are graded based on accomplishments and correctness, the project is graded like an English literature class. You can earn good chunk of points by making a video capturing your presentation skills, even if your project is a complete failure. Yet you don't earn any more point for taking more innovative or difficult approaches than other students. This is a lost of consistency. \n\nThis course is completely lost in the big world of data science. You'll be wandering aimlessly too if you follow this course. \n\nHaving said that, this course would be an easy A if that was all you'd care about. You just simply have to work really hard on it. It is a \"work hard, not smart\" kind of course that loses my interest quickly. \n\nGood luck! There are 4 assignments and 1 final project and I wanted to quit 5 times. All of them are excruciating and there are 0 scores all the time, even during the stage of final project. \n\nCompared with Machine Learning, the workload for this one is waaaay much heavier and the assignments are way much more difficult. For ML, the assignment does not have a fixed answer, you can basically write it in any reasonable way; however, for all 4 assignment here, your scripts must generate a set of unique right answers (some of them need to be within in a certain range), if your script does not compile, you got 0 (because they were auto-graded). \nFor each homework, there are several questions. Although TAs claimed that they would grade them independently, it is highly possible that, if you can not solve the 1st one, you cannot go any further. \nThe videos on Udacity are \"useless\", you can barely learn nothing from there; but you will learn everything else via assignments, final project, labs, and student discussion posts on Piazza. \n\nThis course is about Health, but it's not healthy at all to take it - so many sleepless nights, excruciating debuging process, having no idea where to go, etc. etc. :) This has been the most intensive, hardcore, and outrageously awesome course ever. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy it as much because I took 6505 CCA along with this course, but I still got a lot out of it. \n\nThings I liked\n- hands on exposure with real big data in a practical field (medical)\n- exposure to technologies that are currently being used in the field today. \n- the guest lectors. \n- Hands on experience on what machine learning really is capable of doing. \n- good community of help through Piazza. \n\nThings that I wasn't so fond of but are good\n- hacking away, just trying to get things set up before I could even run my code. You should really have experience working on a linux server so you can start using AWS and the hadoop environment. \n- Trying to differentiate equations that weren't ever mentioned in the course lectors or course prerequisites\n- making matrix multiplication work through Spark. \n- Easy Chair. it was anything but easy... or a chair. \n\nThings I didn't like \n- sometimes I felt TAs were very short. I can't entirely blame them, there is a lot on their plate. I wanted to turn in a newer version of my final project which I knew was still within the deadline. Not much luck talking about it. \n- Class still has a lot of kinks that need to be worked out. How to give feedback on the final project wasn't very clear until the last moment. \n- First homework assignment was using python pandas/numpy environment. Easy, know it already. Anyone that has already taken Machine Learning probably already knows about that environment. it would have been better if there was an assignment on the AWS EMR environment with a little bit of python to follow through. \n- Main lectures were interesting but almost completely useless. \n\nI was deceived. Somewhere probably on the syllabus, I remember reading that this course would most likely take over 15 hours every week. So I assumed it wouldn't be too bad. 20 or so a week was something I could manage. it was more than double that.  This class has been difficult for me because I lack some of the required foundation in both Math and Machine Learning. The lectures are somewhat superficial but easy to follow. The majority of learning (so far) has taken place in the labs (super helpful) and the assignments. I have found other students and TAs in the class to be very helpful in Piazza. I think the material covered (big data tools such as Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Spark) has been very cool, but I would have preferred more of the Health Informatics focus. If you are not comfortable with mathematic notation (like me!) I would recommend brushing up before taking this course.  This is the most \"practical\" course I've taken so far ( out of 9 ). It is very harsh at the beginning if you're not well prepared ( to meet the pre-req ). I had some experience with hadoop, mapreduce and piglatin before, thus the first 2 homework were not that bad. But learning scala and spark within 2 weeks was brutal. TA, professor and especially classmates are very helpful. The second half of the course is about project. I did learn a lot for writing and coding. It is also almost self-paced which made life much easier if compared to the first half. It is a very useful course if you plan to learn big data and use the related tools. But be prepared it is not an easy one.  This class will require you to learn and work on the problem with all time that you have. You also need to work with the TA and professor to clarify a lot of issue in the assignment. The assignment is well-structured but misses a lot of information. There is so much research that you have to do in each assignment. Strongly recommend to take this class by itself. You will learn a lot at the end of the course.  **Important note:** I took another course which was very time consuming (not GA) as well while I was taking this course, so that may influence my view of this course as well. And just for you to know I had taken more than half the labs of  this course and all OMSCS ML-related courses before day 1 of this course.\n\nDo you want to learn Big Data? OK, then take the best course or MOOC you can find online or offline or start some coding by yourself. Don't take this course. That's my best advice. Why?\n\n- **Professor is almost never around.** This is perhaps the biggest issue, and from my point of view, where all the other problems come from (he just doesn't see what is going on). You don't see him around in Piazza and he doesn't respond emails. I've been in other very few courses where professor is never around, but this course takes it to the next level. He participates with teams when it's time to start the project though. I can attest that.\n- **It's outdated.** They use spark 1.3 in virtual environment for homeworks. Latest spark version by the time of this writing is 2.3. So, it's mainly focused on RDDs, which is being left behind in favor of DataFrames. You can still use DataFrames in spark 1.3, but it's not mature enough. The same happens to other tools used. Some of the tools are not even the most used tool of their type out there. So sometimes you feel like you're learning it for academic purposes mainly or to get the grade. Having to give almost 40 hours every week to something like that can be frustrating.\n- **Feedback takes a long time to arrive**. There were times I had to wait a lot to get an official response, way more than other courses. TAs do this, I don't remember having seen professor do it.\n- **Fighting against environment**. They give you an environment you have to set up at the start of semester. It's good help, but you'll end up fighting that environment the rest of the semester.\n- **So much work is worth very few points**. 4 Homeworks take lots and lots of hours every week, but they are worth 10% of the whole grade each. Only 40% of the grade after 8 weeks of no social life, maybe 200 hours of work or more (each homework is given 2 weeks).\n- **Forget you had a family.** Your family will miss you for the whole semester. If you have a spouse, he/she won't be happy you decided to take this course.\n\nFrom my point of view, this is one of the **most important subjects for Machine Learning Specialization** because of how often you are asked to know this stuff for a job, and I liked the fact that GT had a course on this. I waited to have a good amount of ML knowledge before taking it, and I think the intention is good, but this course needs a revamp desperately and a professor with time well spent on Piazza.\n\nThis course was way too hard, and half of it was because of the wrong reasons (getting environment to work correctly, lack of documentation, lack of lecture on subjects needed for homeworks). \n\nI think they are thinking in improving this course, hope they do. I could have taken 2 other courses in the time it took to finish this course.\n\n The amount of work expected in this class is insane for a 3 credit class. When the professor designed the course, I doubt he realized how time-consuming it would actually be. \n\nIt took me 2-2. 5x as much time as Machine Learning (7641) did. As mentioned below, the time-spent-to-amount-learned ratio is not very good. I probably spent about 5% of the time actually learning and 95% of the time hacking away / throwing everything against the wall to get something to work. Many classmates had similar feelings. \n\nOne of the (4) homeworks took me about 12 hours just to get the very first part correct - worth 5 points; and that step was necessary to move on with the rest of the assignment. On another assignment I was stuck on the first section for an entire week and spent around 30 hours trying to figure out what was wrong. The students on Piazza and the TAs are helpful, but when you are truly stuck, too bad - you'll get a bad grade. What's worse is that the TAs don't share the correct solutions with you afterwards. Because of this, I feel like there's a lot I didn't take away from the class. \n\nThe class frequently has guest lecturers, which seem extremely interesting. Unfortunately, the instructors never shared any of the videos past March 1st, so the majority of talks were never shared with OMSCS students. Students asked about this on Piazza (several times) with no response from the teaching team. \n\nThe final project is enjoyable, but my mentor didn't make things easy. For the project, my mentor was supposed to upload a large. csv file to a Postgres database, but 2 days before the due date he still couldn't get it working -- which led to me having to re-write a significant portion of my code. I spent about 20 hours debugging this, but still couldn't get it working - because of that, I was forced to use a smaller dataset (which I'll be punished for). \n\nThis course has a lot of potential, but desperately needs to be re-designed and have the professor more actively involved.  I came into the class already knowing SQL and Spark in scala fairly well, and had taken the rest of the ML specialization already, so take my workload and difficulty ratings with a grain of salt. Here are some things that might be helpful to know:\n- You need to know how to calculate partial derivatives, use the chain rule, etc. You have to derive various update equations and then code them. In other words, if you weren't able to derive the equations, you wouldn't be able to do the entire rest of the homework and would get a terrible score. That could really rain on someone's parade.\n- You are required to use scala for Spark (except on the Group Project). You are not allowed to use pyspark. \n- There are 4 homework assignments and then a group project. No exams.\n- You need to know SQL for most of the homework\n- The first homework uses Pandas and sklearn. The rest do not.\n- The second homework uses Hive, Pig, Map-Reduce, and scala Spark in Zeppelin. You don't need to know Hive, Pig or Map-Reduce very well. Just do the practice lab before the course starts and you will be fine on those.\n- The 3rd and 4th homework are scala Spark. You need to know it pretty well.\n- The 4th homework uses Spark's Graph-X. \n- The Group Project is worth a lot of your grade. A lot of people did projects based on Deep Learning.\n\nWARNING: when testing your homework using their test scripts, do not assume your code is correct if it passes. Their tests are inadequate. Many students complained of having passed all the tests but then losing lots of points.\n\nPros of the course: Great practical experience in big data. The homework was very worthwhile and I enjoyed it.\nCons of the course: This course could be great if anyone on the teaching staff would dedicate even a little bit of effort. They will give you a set up for Zeppelin using Docker that takes many hours to complete and then you find out at the end that the set-up doesn't work, and in fact, when they gave it to you, THEY ALREADY KNEW IT DIDN'T WORK because it didn't work in the previous semesters either. And they still keep handing it out. No respect for students' time whatsoever. The instructions in general are frequently ambiguous or wrong, and no efforts are made to correct them. The TAs make brief appearances on piazza to give 3 word responses that do not answer the question that was asked. The professor of record has no interaction with the class whatsoever -- not even a single piazza post -- except each group for the group projects were allowed to meet with him for 10 minutes over 3 days of his choosing. Then after we all cleared out our schedule for the great honor, at the last minute, he cancelled and told everybody on that day they needed to move to day x. Which of course most of us could not do without any advanced notice. So I never had a single interaction with him. Lastly, the pacing of the course is bizarre -- almost backwards. The more time a homework or task takes, the less time you are given to do it. And the easier it is, the more time you are given to do it. The homework and project are not given out ahead of time so there is no way for students to correct for this.\n\nI still liked the class despite all this in that it really did help me become confident with big data technologies and scala Spark in particular. It just frustrates me to know end that the course could be SO much better with just a little effort. Took this course on my first sem in OMS. It was a useful course to me because I got to learn big data technologies like spark, hadoop, scala etc., - but you could have learned more if you just read a book on each of those subjects as this course does not go deep into each technology.\n\nThere were a lot of difficulties setting up env in the beginning. TAs were kinda responsive, but not very helpful. The homeworks were not structured well at all! I did have plenty of time to complete each homework, but I had no idea whether my code was right or wrong! There was no feedback or guidance on this part. So, for many assignments - students who check their code on few test cases after submission learned that they had missed a minor edge case which was only in the TA's test set and lost marks due to that. IMHO, if you actually want to learn big data technologies, grab a few books with big data tech. names on them and just do the programs in the book. You'll learn a lot more that way.\n\nThe only interesting part of the course was the project (which fortunately was a huge chunk of your final grade). You are allowed to choose from a wide range of pre-selected topics. The project can be done in a group of 3 or solo. You can also get access to datasets which are normally not available for free access online. I would say this was the only useful thing I got out of this course.\n\nI would assume this course is going to be restructured or rebuilt soon because of the complaints that were made during my semester. Overall, if you are not comfortable learning and implementing with 3-4 technologies in a short period of time, you are going to have a hard time. If you want to take this course, pair it with some lighter course and read additional big data material on your own to get the most out of this course. This course is tough but you will learn a lot. Don't take this with any other tough course. It would be too hard to manage your time between office family and studies. But all said.. this is the course if you really want to learn the big data tools. If you dont have any ML experience or advanced statistic experience you will suffer in the beginning and you will have to work hard to get the homeworks done on time. If you are taking this course make sure you start working on assignments as soon they are released. They are not easy to work on if you start in last 4-5 days.  I'll try to share my personal experience (which is very different from the other reviews). I'm aware that my background definitely helped a lot, so I hope this review could be helpful for people with a background similar to mine. \n\nThe main skills needed for this class are:\n- Experience on Linux CLI, environment variables, how to install packages/libraries, etc. Also knowing how to use a Virtual Machine. \n- Some background in Machine Learning: what cross-validation is, typical metrics, how to train a model, and how to run predictions on it for supervised and unsupervised methods. \n- Experience working with data in both databases and structured files: SQL, aggregation functions, joins, constraints, etc. \n- Having the maturity/confidence to quickly learn on your own how to hack your way in some new programming language. \n\nI have 15 years industry experience with databases (not big data), scripting languages in Linux, and I had previously taken ML, ML4T, RL. The assignments took me like 20-30 hours each (spread through 2 weeks, a workload of 15 hours/week). \n\nOn the other hand I can see how for someone with no experience AT ALL in the skills mentioned above, this class could take as much as 30-40 hours/week. \n\nSome people have mentioned \"you HAVE to LEARN Pig/Hbase/Hive\". I don't think that's exactly the case. I found myself googling things like \"how to left join pig\" and adapting some snippet from S. O. On the other hand if you don't really know what an outer join, group by, etc. are, of course it will be hard to look for something you don't understand. \n\nCompleting the labs before the class started helped me a lot: http://www. sunlab. org/teaching/cse6250/spring2017/lab \nIn that way, I didn't waste time setting up the environment for each assignment (the labs are closely related with assignments 2, 3, and 4). \n\nAs other reviews as mentioned, you are mostly on your own on the 2nd part of the class, but I think the grading was very lenient. Sadly I ran out of space for this review For me, this is the single hardest class I have taken in the program (it is my 10th). The material is very difficult and the assignments have unclear directions. You can get stuck on something for 10 hours that is only worth 5% of a project, but completing that is required to proceed onto other part of the projects. I have spent 30 hours on each of the first two projects and wasn't able to get a B on either. The teaching team is very responsive on Piazza but it can be difficult to find answers there because it seems a lot of students are struggling.  A few things on expectations before taking this class:\n\nyou should already have a background in ML as the topic is lightly covered in class. Also, you should already know Python and Pandas and Scala. Surprisingly, very little Java is used. \n\nAs far as the big data aspect, you will have to learn on your own as the class doesn't teach as much (there are some labs available for you to do on your own but you're better off with vendor based training or other tutorials).  This class is amazing. You will learn SO much about data mining, ETL, and modern model building techniques. However, you will be expected to learn a LOT by yourself, and FAST. Before touching this class I would look at being able to write both Python and Scala. In addition, familiarity with Vagrant and general Linux admin tasks are pretty mandatory. Finally, if it's been a while since you've taken an advanced statistics course, you should look into that-- you'll be expected to derive some pretty advanced formulas (partial derivatives included) and implement them in code. If you have these prereqs, then learning the Hadoop and Spark ecosystems shouldn't be too bad. Do not take with another high-load class (like IOS, ML, or CCA).  Do you want a challenge? Do you want to use all the big data software we hear so much about (e. g. hadoop, spark)? Do you also want less sleep? :)\n\nIf you answered yes to all of those questions, then take this class. The class was incredibly interesting, with lots of work and investigation required by the student. The lectures are really light on material, as the professor says, it is expected that the student goes out and learns and experiments on their own. \n\nI would highly suggest being familiar with Python, some Scala, and Machine Learning concepts BEFORE taking this course. I really did love the course, it was incredibly challenging, but very rewarding at the end. \n\nThe professor does need to get things a bit more organized in terms of expectations of deliverables, but given this was the first semester and the professor seems to react well to lots of questions and a bit of criticism, I am certain it will improve.  *Context*\n* Software engineer with many years of experience.\n* Significant experience with SQL, Unix, Python, Git, Docker.\n* Some experience with Scala.\n* No prior experience with Spark, Hive, Pig, Hadoop\n* Taken (ML4T, RL, AI) previously. \n\n*Pros*\n* Hands on experience with the Data Science Pipeline. Data exploration and pre-processing, feature construction, Model training, etc.\n* Hands on experience with Big Data Tools, brief enough to touch several tools aspects, but difficult enough to force you to think through the problems and grasp the basics.\n* Interesting and relevant Healthcare related Problems. You will actually use ML techniques to tackle these types of problems.\n* A taste of the variety of problems in Healthcare that can be tackled with ML.\n* The Homework is well structured, from easier to hardest.\n* The project is based on some suggested topics, but it is fairly open ended.\n* The professor participated more in Piazza than in other courses. The TA were usually responsive.\n* An automated environment with all the required software for Homework was provided. After the initial setup investment it worked the rest of the semester without issues for me.\n* A server with enough resources was provided to do our projects, turned out to be really useful.\n\n*Cons*\n* The auto grading process is tricky, it is really hard to know how/what caused point deductions, even when all local tests passed. You have 50% chance of getting a very good grade or a really bad grade, regardless of your efforts and local checks.\n* The grading and re-grading experience depended on the particular style of the given TA. They should have common principles and be more consistent.\n* The automated environment setup could be tricky for some people. In my case, I spent like 5 hours setting it up, then it worked fine. This is a very hard class but you will learn a lot and feel proud at the end. The homeworks require you to know Python, Hive, Pig, Scala, Spark. I knew the first 3 and took the \"labs\" before starting the semester. The labs are basically non graded tutorials you do on your own to learn Scala/Spark and other tools. Even with the labs and some background knowledge (I took Machine Learning before), the homeworks could take you 60 hrs. My life could have been much easier if I knew Scala before hand, but I learn while taking the class. If you survive the 4 homeworks with a decent grade, the second part is much easier - basically a project (a paper) about a Healthcare related topics from a list of topics suggested by the Professor. TLDR: Do the labs and learn basic scala before the semester starts and you will be fine. Still time consuming This was a very fast paced class. There is a mountain of technical + industry vertical knowledge that is being covered in the first few weeks and students are expected to be self-starters. If you expect the lectures to cover the material you will be disappointed. I spent close to 20 hours every week learning + iterating on the homeworks/projects. It has been a great experience but the time commitment is a must. I dropped this class about a month into the semester so I'm not sure if things get better, but so far the class has been pretty awful. The professor has only made 3 very minor appearances on Piazza, only one TA is active, and the lectures are short and have almost nothing to do with the course content. Everything that I've learned has been through self-learning, which 1) is not a very efficient way to learn a large amount of new material as I find myself constantly reinventing the wheel and 2) I can do this for free on my own time, focusing on exactly what I'm interested in. The assignments do force you to learn new technologies and techniques, but I'm sure that I could have learned a lot more in a lot less time if there was guidance. \n\nI don't have a specific interest in data science, but in general I can't imagine myself liking any course where there's no meaningful instruction and instead we're given time-consuming (40+ hour) homeworks to hack away at using whatever resources we can find. The amount of work required for the amount I was learning was too great and in all likelihood none of this will ever be useful to me professionally so I cut my losses and dropped. If you actually work in this area or want to work in this area, the course might be worth it since it forces you to use a lot of different technologies, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nYou'll learn a lot in this class like the other reviews state, but it's because you'll spend almost as much time on it as you do at your full time job, not because it's actually a good class. On the bright side it's probably an easy A if you have 600 hours to devote to it over the semester. Its a great course. I had some experience with big data tools, Python and ML before I opted for this course and yet I got hammered. Sometimes, its very frustrating. The assignments take a lot of time and nothing from the videos or lab prepares you enough and one needs to figure out a lot of stuff on their own. I am currently halfway through the course and have learnt a lot. The course could be structured a little better.  As mentioned by others, this is a VERY challenging course unless you already use big data technologies and know Scala. I had completed half of the labs prior to taking the course and have taken all other ML / data courses in the program, so the machine learning and general data concepts weren't extremely challenging. The catch, though, was trying to drink from a fire hose in order to complete the homework assignments. The challenge w/ the assignments was picking up Scala, working with provided virtualized / containerized environments (for Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Zeppelin, etc. ) that weren't fully functional or compatible with the requirements of the assignment. Get ready to troubleshoot the tools you're given. \n\nThe instructor and TA were not at all very interactive on Piazza. IF we got an answer, it was often not necessarily answering the question given, wasn't complete, or so general the question needed to be asked again from a few additional angles. Many times there just wasn't a response. We completed our final project submissions and hadn't received feedback on an assignment submitted about 1. 5 months prior... most recent grading feedback was 2 months ago. TA office hours were non-existant... really were \"message the TA and hope for a response\". The prof' did host a couple opportunities to have a brief chat session to discuss the project, but this was about it. \n\nScala is nice now that I've done it, but was a bit of a paradigm shift for me, so work on it ahead of time. Aim to complete all of the labs prior to the beginning of the semester. If one could hang with the class pace of assignments for a little over half of the semester, then the 2nd portion was dedicated to an individual/group project and was much more tolerable as you could select/control the technology and environment to work within. Also, as w/ any course w/ a team project, vet a good team early. \n\nYou will pick up a lot of pertinent technology, but will work for it (find help early). This course, as it was for Spring 2016, is an enormous amount of work. Every homework introduced multiple different tools, techniques and programming languages. You need to have a strong mathematical background in linear algebra. You should also be familiar with python (numpy and pandas especially) and scala. I would strongly recommend doing Martin Odersky's coursera scala course, a linear algebra refresher and ML before considering this course.  This course is very hands-on and you'll get very awarding learning experience, but it's best to take it with another easy course or on its own. \n\nThe difficulty highly depends on how much time you can allocate. Nothing is impossible but every single part of every assignment is time consuming. There are 4 homework assignments due every 2 weeks for the first part of the course and a project for the second half. Every assignment involves serious effort. Expect to spend several full days on each. This course covers several big data tools, but it's not a programming course. So you need to learn on your own well enough to finish the assignments. Make sure you start early. Assignments are assessed by autograding using different data sets than the ones you have, so I kind of miss the Udacity autograder that I used to hate, since at least you know you get it when you get it. The project focuses more on your ability to interpret data and understand the topic you choose. Your report/paper will be graded for the project, not your code. \n\nThe instructors and TAs are very active on piazza and helpful. It's a new course so there are some problems every once a while, so make sure you keep an eye on the announcement and pinned messages, in case there's any code or instruction update. The teaching staff are aware of the problems and are trying their best not to make things confusing. It's not perfect but they listen to suggestions and will likely make this course more organized.  This is a hard course and it lacked a bit of organizing. Its probably because it was the first iteration for OMS, but the TA's were very helpful. The assignments are meant to be hard so you actually spend your time working and learning. I liked it that way. I had to actually implement a lot of it on my own with little help from piazza which I thought was very good. You might actually not find code snippets online as well since we are using multiple technologies. \n\nIf you want to go in prepared, this is what you need to know. These are not buzz words, but actual tech stuff I used this course. \n1. Python, sklearn, pandas, matplotlib (HW1)\n2. hadoop, hive, pig (HW2)\n3. Scala , Spark, mllib, graphx (HW3, HW4, project)\n4. vagrant (I dint have to go beyond setting it up and running some scripts)\n5. aws-docker, I dint use it just played with for project\n6. Heath informatics and machine learning concepts\n7. IntelliJ and Pycharm were the editors I used. Makes your life tad bit easier. \n\nYou are allowed to use any of the big data framework for project but I used scala and spark. \n\nIts a great course and I took it along side ML. They kind of complemented with each other and they deadlines dint overlap much, so worked for me.  Pros: challenging and interesting, you will learn the basics of the big data ecosystem, Hadoop, Spark, learned the basic of Scala, and refresh your machine learning algorithms(it is hard to believe one can survive without taking some basic ML course). \n\nCons: professor was never seen before team project, some TAs are not engaging(I am however very impressed with one TA who helped with nice instructions to set up zeppelin in vagrant while the original setup does not work for most), grading is something you should worry about since the tests are not well designed, you may end up with lots of points deducted though it passed the sample tests they provided. Severely insufficient teaching material compared to what you need to accomplish the homework. Homework instructions are at times obviously unclear or insufficient. This is purposely designed to be a \"learn by doing\" course and that comes with a lot of pros and cons. On the positive side, you get your hands dirty with the nitty gritty details of running big data experiments on Hadoop and Spark. I personally did not have much big data experience but by the time I completed the homework assignments I was ready to design and implement a large scale experiment on Hadoop for my project without major issues. \n\nOn the negative side, the lectures and other course content are pretty thin. There was a fairly large gap between content the course provides and what was needed to actually complete the assignments, so most of what I learned in the course was through looking up tutorials and other course materials on the Internet. By far the biggest negative was the workload required for the first three homework assignments, I spent at least 40+ hours per week on the assignments over the six weeks that were given to complete them. The assignments themselves were not necessarily difficult to complete (although one assignment required deriving an equation used throughout the rest of the assignment which the course itself in no way prepares you for), but it's very much as if an entire semester's worth of assignments are crammed into that first part of the course. There were some other minor negatives to the course, mostly in the form of the course being disorganized and instructions being vague or conflicting. \n\nOverall I would say this could be a great course and I personally learned a lot from it, but I can't recommend it in its current form.  I like this class a bit. The only downside honestly is the pace, it's way too fast. The content is interesting and challenging (like a challenge you want to take on) but it can at times be very hard as it requires you have a good math and programming background so you might get stuck on either the math or programming at times. If the pace was slower, the workload would be better, and the class would be easier. Get a study group, and be find someone in real life that can help with either math or the programming portion of the content. The tools you learn here are things you would use in real life.  Summary:\nLearned a ton, very interesting, very rewarding. \nDifficult, very time consuming. \nGrading seems lenient. \n\nThe first half of the class involves 4 homework assignments, each given 2 weeks to complete. These are all pretty time consuming and require the full 2 weeks to complete. Just make sure you don't try to start them late. The second half of the class involves a more open-ended project. The workload was probably lower in the second half. Also, there is lots of extra credit available throughout the class. It seems a sizeable amount of students did not finish all of the assignments, but if you do, there is a good chance you can get >100%. \n\nThere is not much info in the lectures, but there is some good info in the labs. The professor wants students to learn by doing. Personally, I agree that this is the best way to learn (by trying to tackle something I am not quite sure how to do yet), but I can understand some students preferring a more structured approach, where they are told more explicitly how to do what they need to do. I would say the most important skill in this class is just to be a quick learner. \n\nOverall, I learned more in this class than any other I have taken. I would recommend this class if you have any interest in using big data tools. Just don't expect an easy class. I would probably take this class by itself or paired with an easier class.  This is the first class that I have taken the first semester it was offered, so I'm not sure if they're all this half-baked and poorly planned to start, but I would not recommend this course to anyone until the professor fixes the multitude of issues. The workload in this class is insane - 40+ hours a week always - which I would not be as upset about if I were learning a lot too, but you definitely do not get out of this class what you put in. Projects are expected to be completed so quickly you often don't have time to actually learn the tools you're using. The labs don't teach you anything beyond how to copy the code snippets the professor gives you, and the lectures have essentially nothing to do with the projects. It's a pity, because this class seems so interesting in theory, but the execution is remarkably poor. I dropped this course because I feel like I'm putting in too much work to be learning so little - hoping it gets better so I can retake another semester.  This is definitely THE class you need to take if you are into big data technologies. It is the most brutal and most rewarding class that I have taken in OMSCS, and it is the hardcore class I expect to see in a top MSCS program. I personally learned a ton from this course and loved it very much. But be aware of the survival bias. Every two weeks, there were students withdrawing from this class, and only 30+ survived till the end of this semester. \n\nFirst half of the class is about 4 homeworks. Within two weeks, you need to learn new tools, watch tutorials online (in addition to lectures and labs) and finish the coding assignment for each homework. Don't be misled by the difficulty of the first homework, which only takes less than 20 hours of work if you are good at python. Homework 2~4 easily costs you 60-80 hours each. If there were no such intensity, I would not have learned so much in less than 2 months. \n\nSecond half of the class is about a research project on a topic of your choice. Personally, it's my favorite part. At this point, most survivors should be familiar with all the big data tools (spark, hadoop, etc. ) and getting ready for the real meat of this class. There is a pool of topics for you to select, and you are also free to come up with your own topic. Your task is to use the big data tools you've learned to \"reproduce and improve\" a recently published journal paper in the field of Big Data for Healthcare. Given the complexity and shear size of the data, even partially \"reproducing\" other's work is not as easy as it sounds. You can secure a good grade by simply reproducing the result itself. From what I have read as reviewer (you can see all papers of the class), most people couldn't get to the point of matching the published papers. \"Improving\" basically means a publishable work, and very few (maybe 2~3 per semester) can meet that standard. \n\nYou need true passion and serious commitment to succeed in this class. Of the 10 OMSCS courses I have taken, this has by far the heaviest workload. For me, it is approximately double that of CS7641 (ML), which is itself fairly heavy. Some students are putting in over 40 hours per week. In this class, you will learn surprisingly little about BD or ML - I would estimate roughly 20% of your time covers ML or BD. Instead, you will be mired in details such as debugging the class virtual environment or tangling with syntax and type coercion for the new language of the week. Inexplicably, the instructor thinks this is a good thing. \n\nThis class is not far from being completely self-guided as the lectures provide little value. Consequently, we are often unprepared for homework assignments. This leads to focusing on getting things to work rather than learning how to solve problems the right way. If you want to learn BD, you're better off going directly to Google - this class is just a detour for the same.  By far the most time-consuming and frustrating class I've taken in this program (out of 7). Granted, I took it the first semester it was offered in OMS so I was expecting some issues with course content, coordination, and communication. However, it was much worse than I expected and I decided to drop the class and possibly come back to it in a future semester if I get the sense things have improved. This could be a really good class but, as it was, I spent 95% of my time hacking and 5% learning which is not a good educational return on my time. Some things to know or review prior to this class: SQL (particularly joins), how to derive equations , Vagrant VM. Also, be aware that you will be using newer data tools and technologies which could be very valuable to learn but good documentation seemed to be very lacking and the labs barely scratched the surface of what you will need to know to get through the homework. I would strongly recommend taking this class on its own. "
